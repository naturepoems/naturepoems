In the stillness of twilight,
  Where birds withdraw to roost,
  I stand wrapped in shadows,
  Breath caught in the final flare
  Of dayâ€”the color of desire.
  Life flows, silk against skin,
  And I remember the light
  That once played here, brightening
  Each crease of night to come.

- Sylvia Plath
