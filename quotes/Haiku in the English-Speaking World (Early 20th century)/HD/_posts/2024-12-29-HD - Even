The quiet evening
wraps the day in stillness,
dim shadows play
as the stars appear,
a gentle reminder
of all that is vast.
The air cools,
carrying the scent
of earth and leaves,
a perfume of life,
a testament of nature.
As the moon rises,
it pours silver light,
a touch of magic
upon the sleeping world.
