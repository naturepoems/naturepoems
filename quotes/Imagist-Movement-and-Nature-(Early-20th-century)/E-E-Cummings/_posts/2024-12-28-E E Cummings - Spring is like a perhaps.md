Spring is like a perhaps hand,
    which comes to gaze
  nabove the head of a leaning)
   of purple lilac,
       all trunks and fiery
       arabesque trees.

    And where the green leaves 
   cover to a floor,
    water
     pours down the
        world of cedar,
these
  the stone of love.


- E E Cummings
