Invitation

Oh, do you have time,
for this? To attend
to the flower,
to the dragonfly
that holds its endless fantasy
of banks and streams
and all our old, strange needs.
Oh, let the summer rain come,
it will be worth it,
to collect the few bright pearls
that hang in every living thing
a dragonfly or a sparrow,
a warm, wind-blown dalliance,
a clumsy dance under a flower.
Time can be held,
if it is lovingly welcomed,
bring your heart, bring your bones,
every limber thought out to play
where the branches bloom,
where the colors grow solemn
and true.

- Mary Oliver
