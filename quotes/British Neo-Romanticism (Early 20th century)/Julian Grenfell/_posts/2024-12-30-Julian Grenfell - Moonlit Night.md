Moonlit Night
In the embrace of silvery light,
The moon hangs low, a watchful eye,
Casting shadows as day takes flight,
And stars awaken in twilight sky.
A quiet hush, the world undressed,
Nature's canvas, a sight to behold,
Within these moments, I find my rest,
As the night weaves her tales of old.



- Julian Grenfell
