Binsey Poplars

Felix Randal,  he that with his found,
    Now when I will can be myself alone,
  In the woods where June mistakes her jewels,
    On each knot of the bough and the fern,
    Again may I share each with me, I will bear.

  Ah; the wisps of darkly ascending tracks –
  That drive through the sun – a good earth  cast.
    And naught of the green survived the light,
  As black air into the white cleft waits,
    This loss of gold amidst the waning wait.



- Gerard Manley Hopkins
