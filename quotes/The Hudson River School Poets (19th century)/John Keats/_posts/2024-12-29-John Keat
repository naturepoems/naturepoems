La Belle Dame sans Merci

O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
Alone and palely loitering?
The sedge has withered from the lake,
And no birds sing.

O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
So haggard and so woe-begone?
The squirrel’s granary is full,
And the harvest's done.

I see a lily on thy brow—
With anguish moist and fever dew,
And on thy cheek a fading rose
Fast withereth too.

I met a lady in the meads,
Full beautiful—a faery's child,
Her hair was long, her foot was light,
And her eyes were wild;

I made a garland for her head,
And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
She looked at me as she did love,
And made sweet moan.

I sat her on my pacing steed,
And nothing else saw all day long,
For sidelong would she bend, and sing,
A faery's song.

She found me roots of relish sweet,
And honey wild, and manna dew,
And sure in language strange she said—
I love thee true.

She took me to her elfin grot,
And there she gazed and sighed deep,
And there I shut her wild, wild eyes—
So kissed to sleep.

And there we slumbered on the moss,
And there I dreamed—Ah! woe betide!—
The latest dream I ever had
On the cold hillside.

I saw pale kings and princes too,
Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;
They thronged to see me in the west
And said—"I hate you, at my call.

I passed the hoary-headed graves,
The knight-at-arms, he is no more;
He left me, as the dew, a sweet petal,
And the moon in its night for ever bore. 

— La Belle Dame sans Merci
