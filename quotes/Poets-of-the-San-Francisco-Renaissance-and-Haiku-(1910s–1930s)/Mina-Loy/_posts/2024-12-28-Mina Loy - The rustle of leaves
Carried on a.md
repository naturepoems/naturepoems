quote: "The rustle of leaves
Carried on a breeze,
An echo of ancient songs—
Nature converses,
Binding whispers with fading light,
A reprieve from city chaos,
Each path fringed by wild blossoms,
A gallery of unexpected art,
Glowing with the sunset's promises,
Life, a gentle reminder, remains."

The rustle of leaves
Carried on a breeze,
An echo of ancient songs—
Nature converses,
Binding whispers with fading light,
A reprieve from city chaos,
Each path fringed by wild blossoms,
A gallery of unexpected art,
Glowing with the sunset's promises,
Life, a gentle reminder, remains.

- Mina Loy
