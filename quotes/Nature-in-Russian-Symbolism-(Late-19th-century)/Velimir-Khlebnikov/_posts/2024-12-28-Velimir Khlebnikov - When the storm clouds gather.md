When the storm clouds gather,  
a dance of shadows roars  
as nature unfurls its fury,  
the lightning's fingers touch  
the earth and awaken  
the sleeping spirits  
who roam the wild depths.  

With each thunderous drumbeat,  
the hymn of the skies begins,  
a primordial song transcending time,  
a call to the wildness within.

- Velimir Khlebnikov
