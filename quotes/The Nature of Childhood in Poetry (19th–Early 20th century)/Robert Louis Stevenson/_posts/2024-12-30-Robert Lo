A Child’s Garden
In a garden fair, at play we roam,
Among the flowers, we’ll call our home,
Let us seek the buds of cheer,
And treasure all that’s blooming near.

With laughter bright and gentle sway,
The petals whisper as we play,
For nature cradles every child,
In dreams awakened, pure and wild.

- Robert Louis Stevenson
