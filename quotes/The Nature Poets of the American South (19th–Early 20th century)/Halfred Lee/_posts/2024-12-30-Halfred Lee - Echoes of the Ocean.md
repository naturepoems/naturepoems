Echoes of the Ocean

The ocean's roar, a serenade,  
Crashing waves, a dance portrayed.  
The salty air, the gulls in flight,  
A symphony of day and night.
  
With sandy shores, whispers call,  
Stories written by nature's thrall.  
A timeless echo, vast and grand,  
The pulse of life on ocean's strand.


- Halfred Lee
