The tranquil lake is a mirror bright,
Reflecting the scene of a life reborn;
Where every sundown brings the night,
And every sunrise hints of the morn.
In stillness, the world finds a way to renew,
As nature croons melodies soft and light,
A blessing sent with the morning dew,
In the arms of nature, everything’s right.

- Archibald Lampman
