I will climb the mountains,
I will fetch the waters,
I will seek the heights,
And there, perhaps, I shall sit and think
With rest upon my soul.

How deep the heart of silence,
How loud the breath of trees—
How still the shores of oceans.
I shall be alone and free,
Between the sky and the sea.


- Louise Bogan
