So racing sun and moon;
The sinuous stretch of quiet hours;
Nature blending fast with cold and tide,
In a dance that curls up softly at thoughts,
At framing silenceâ€”where buzzing rumbles;
Humming birds passage through space,
Wanting more and more, desperately light,
But with them follows burdens of flight,
The tender touch of the earth warms.
Feelings embrace the calm dusk,
And all the swells but work dumb,
And narcissistic true beauty, we hold tight!
