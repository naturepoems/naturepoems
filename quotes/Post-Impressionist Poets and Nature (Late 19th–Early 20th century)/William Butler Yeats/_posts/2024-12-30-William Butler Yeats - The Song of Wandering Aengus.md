The Song of Wandering Aengus

I went out to the hazel wood,
Because a fire was in my head,
And I cut and peeled a hazel wand,
And hooked a berry to a thread;
And when white moths were on the wing,
And moth-like stars were flickering out,
I dropped the berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout.

When I had laid it on the bank,
And gone to blow the fire in flame,
I looked and hooked a berry to a thread;
And again came Aengus, the same.

Though I am old with wandering
Through hollow lands and hilly lands,
I will find out where she has gone,
And kiss her lips and take her hands;
And walk among long dappled grass,
And pluck till time and times are done,
The silver apples of the moon,
The golden apples of the sun.

- William Butler Yeats
