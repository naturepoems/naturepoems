Ode on Melancholy

No, no! go not to Lethe, neither twist
   Wolfe’s-bane, eucalypytes nor siren ;
For to so many delights it is much
   More that twilight held out like a hand.

Than fading in stormy nights, to drown,
   In silence I draw back to fields’s edge.
Where calmness is found—to be blissful,
   Black shades sighing ‘neath the trees.

Without one thought of darkness, the long prayer,
   A line, close the door, in severest eyes.

— *Ode on Melancholy*

- John Keats
