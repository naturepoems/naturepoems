Magdalene Walking in the Dark

I walk along through shadowed halls,
   The world's a silent song in night,
And moonbeams fall like shattered calls,
   As sorrow breathes in soft twilight.

Where petals linger, dreams hang still,
   Each whisper stronger than despair,
For in the silence of the will,
   The heart shall learn and humbly bear.

With every step I tread anew,
   The shadows shift, a world in play,
In nature's arms, each thought runs true,
   For beauty lights the darkest way.
