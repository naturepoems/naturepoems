The Waste Land

I. The Burial of the Dead

April is the cruellest month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull roots with spring rain.

Winter kept us warm, covering
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
A little life with dried tubers.

Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.

Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
And when we were children, staying at the arch-duke’s,
My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled,
And I was frightened. He said, ‘Marie,
Now you can play with the Swiss, you can fly.'

Falling from the sky, but it was only a moment's play,
Listening, what you will.

The dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,
And the dry stone no sound of water.  

Only there is no eyed dew that keeps the grass short,  
Only the longest and straggling of summer rains  
An hour of twilight last only for a day.  

If you find any memory more  
Secure than the moments then when we were all together.

- T S Eliot
