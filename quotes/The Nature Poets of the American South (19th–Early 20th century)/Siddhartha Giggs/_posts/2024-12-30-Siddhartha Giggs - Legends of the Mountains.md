The mountains whisper legends in the chill of the air,
A tapestry woven with memories rare.
Ancient stones tell of times long gone by,
In their steadfast gaze, my spirit learns to fly.

The stars blanket night with their luminous glow,
Guiding lost souls on the paths they don’t know.
In the silence of darkness, I find my own sound,
In nature’s embrace, my weary heart is unbound.


- Siddhartha Giggs
