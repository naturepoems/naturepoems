What little yet intact remains,
   With flowers at the eastern part,
A shivering leaf, a shivering rumble,
   Is to capture the night’s soft heart.

So be this sweet release,
   Where every feeling hurts again;
Kiss a few of the leaves, and slow,
   Bring a heart to fight again once more.

— *To Save Us*

- John Keats
