The Ballad of Chamberlain’s Son
It is pleasant to see the world in green,
To know there’s air trembling round my heart,
The silken breeze—or is it a prisoner’s thread?
A violet garden, symbols of morning’s glow,
All of nature spills in scents of release,
A bond forged between heart and stem.

- Ezra Pound
