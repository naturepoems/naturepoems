The Meadow

Upon the gentle, grassy plain,  
The wildflowers dance in joy and rain;  
With color bright, they sway with ease,  
In harmony with every breeze.

Oh, sweet content, oh, simple grace,  
In nature's arms, our hearts find place;  
The meadow blooms in joyful air,  
And whispers softly: 'Dream and dare.'

- Hartley Coleridge
