Nature's Embrace
Wrapped in nature's gentle arms,
I find solace in her many charms.
With each leaf, a lullaby sung,
In her presence, I am young.

The mountains cradle, the rivers hum,
A reminder of where we all come from.
In the dance of life, I'm but a part,
Connected deeply, heart to heart.


- Oda Ndukkor
