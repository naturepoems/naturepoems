Evening in the Garden  
 
Softly fades the day to rest,  
As twilight paints the sky its best;  
Each blossom closes, bids goodbye,  
To starlit dreams that fill the sky.  

The crickets chirp their evening tune,  
As silvery light begins to swoon;  
Nature's canvas, pure delight,  
Whispers softly, “hold me tight.”

- William Henry Channing
