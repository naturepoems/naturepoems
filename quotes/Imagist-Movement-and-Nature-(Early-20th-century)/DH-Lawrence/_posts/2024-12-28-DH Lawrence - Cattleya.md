Cattleya
  
In the sun-drenched garden,
Cattleya blooms the most,  
Exquisite and elegant,
A surge of petals rich
With color and passion.

In layers of fragrance,
It spills its soft world,
Across the velvet air,
A tender perfume,
Awakening sweet responses
From the passing breeze.

In a sacred stillness,
I stand witness
To this fleeting beauty,
The moment engraved,
Its grace held in time,
As life unfolds like petals.

                         - DH Lawrence
