The sea stretches wide,  
A canvas of blue and gold,  
Where the horizon kisses the sky,  
And the sun dips low,  
Spilling fire across the waters.

Beneath the waves,  
Life teems undiscovered,  
Wondrous and vibrant,  
In the depths of the unknown,  
Where silence reigns yet holds  
The whispers of the world above.

From the shore, I gaze,  
Feeling the salt upon my skin,  
Listening to the lapping tides,  
Each wave a gentle story  
Of far-off lands and mysteries,  
Binding us all in the rhythm  
Of nature's eternal embrace.

- Fritjof Nansen
