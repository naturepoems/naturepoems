Whispers of the Wind
Beneath the stars I stand,
As the wind whispers secrets,
Of ages long gone by,
It carries stories of ancients,
And the dreams of the once untried.

It rustles through the leaves,
An echo of laughter from afar,
Of children playing in fields,
Where the horizon kisses the sky,
Each breeze, a memory, a sigh.

- Gabriel Okara
