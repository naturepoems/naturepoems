In the heart of woodland,
There lays a quiet realm,
Sunlight filters through,
Painting the ground in gold.
Around me, life stirs and spins,
A dance of creation,
The rustling leaves, the gentle sighs
Of the deep-rooted trees,
In this cathedral of nature,
I find my holy ground.

               – From "Cathedral of Nature"

- Annie Dillard
