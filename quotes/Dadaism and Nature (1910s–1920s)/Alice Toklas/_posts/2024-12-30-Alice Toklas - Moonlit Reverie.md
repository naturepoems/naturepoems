The moon hangs low,
a silver pendant,
poised above,
a silent watcher,
a guardian of dreams,
as they drift, wander,
into the endless night.

Beneath stars,
a canopy of stories,
a tapestry unfurls,
each twinkling a whisper,
a reminder of journeys,
apart yet one,
in this fluid expanse.

I stand,
a quiet witness,
a solitary observer,
with roots that dig
deep into the earth,
tethering thoughts,
a dance that transcends,
na love letter to existence,
while shadows play,
of laughter and tears,
oh the absurdity of life.

The cosmos breathes,
a slow burn,
a pulse felt through worlds,
where time ceases to matter,
a circle of being,
a fragile, beautiful,
Dadaist reverie.

- Alice Toklas
