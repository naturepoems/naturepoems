Night Song

Bring my soul no painful things,
  The bright note under the wing,
That from one heart of gold can ring
  And lift it all upon a beam. 
Love is no such rarest thing,
  But a joy that remains alone, 
And on the night the nightingale lifts
  Her voice in harmony — unshown!

- Edna St Vincent Millay
