A Toad

The spotted toad stretches softly, 
echoes into murmurings. Its body
is earthy color mixed on grays,
yet painted with glistening gloom,
it slips between grassy shadows—a glimmer 
under pines, surely borne among shuffle underbrush.
Invasive, yet overtly sacramental; it waits,
yearning wilder forms, distilling the sky,
a clutter of contemplation, an echo 
from where it stood six moons ago,
pulling it down, sweet and voiceless.
But gleams of pebble keep silent, letting them stay,
it asks the treads of time while coolness builds,
to draw water from stones, far beneath the sense.


- Marianne Moore
