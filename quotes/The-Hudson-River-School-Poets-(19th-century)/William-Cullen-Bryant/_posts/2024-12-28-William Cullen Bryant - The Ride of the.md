The Ride of the Spirits

Spirit of the fields in the morningâ€™s stride,  
Cast upon my heart, a smooth, sweet burden; 
Carry in the air through the flowers inside,  
Richest tenets free from all woe and burden.

Let our hearts soar like the songs of the lark,  
And we shall fly as the light kisses the morn;  
In the whispers of air that darkens the park,  
A thanks to the spirits shall always be born.

- William Cullen Bryant
