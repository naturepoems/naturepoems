The Green Hills
Oh, the green rolling hills of the Great Southern Land!
Where the sun sheds his gold, and the fresh waters stand,
Where the bush life is strong, and the rugged barked trees
Kiss the sweet scent of flowers swaying gently in the breeze.
Here freedom lies deep, in the peace of the vale,
Where the rivers run clear and sweet, never pale,
Oh, the green rolling hills, with the soft songs of night,
In a world full of wonder, nature's purest light.
Through the shadows of dusk, when the stars take their flight,
My heart sings with joy, in the green hills, delight!

- Henry Lawson
