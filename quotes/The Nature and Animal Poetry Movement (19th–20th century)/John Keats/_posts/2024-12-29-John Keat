Hyperion

Deep in the shady sadness of a vale
   
Where, like a wicked Queen, the desolation
   
Is frightened to find its beauty frail,
   
There I wander'd in my solitudes alone,
   
While Apollos stood with his flaxen mane,
   
Upon the brow of sunflower head—
   
'Till dews of glimmering flowers overhelm
   
This murky knoll, and with gentle grace
   
In a silken belt of shadows deeper than dimmed.
