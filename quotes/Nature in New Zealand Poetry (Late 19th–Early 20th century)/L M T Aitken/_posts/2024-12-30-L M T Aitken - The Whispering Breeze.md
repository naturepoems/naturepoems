The whispering breeze through verdant trees,
   Strums softly on the woodland's heart;
Each leaf and bough, like melodies,
   Plays nature’s song, a classic art.

When morning dew on grass appears,
   A jeweled cloak, the earth adorned;
With every dawn, in joy and tears,
   The beauty of our world is born.


- L M T Aitken
