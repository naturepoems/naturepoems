Trees

Underneath the leaves,
a darkness isn’t hidden,
joins the roots,
nurtures the fragile,
makes the tree stand.
Every branch, a story;
every leaf, a record.
The air whispers familiar sounds,
while I drink in the quiet,
yearning for what feels
granite and sky,
where the trunks
each push beyond their limits,
yet hold firm below.


- Robert Creeley
