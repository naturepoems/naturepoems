Feathers soaked in marijuana,
   “Living cannot be so sweet!”
   let this earth round away.
   Tremors blossom,
   as plumes trumpet,
   in unison,.
   While tall grasses tangle
   what could not be
   and transcend upon
   the honesty of warmth.
   The jesters’ lands,
   weaving fresher air, 
   hurricane dreams that sail!

- Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven
