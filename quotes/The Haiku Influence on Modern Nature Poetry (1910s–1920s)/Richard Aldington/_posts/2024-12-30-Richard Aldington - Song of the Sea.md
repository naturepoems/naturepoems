The sea stretches wide before me,
An expanse of quivering blue,
Reflecting the sun’s golden smile,
Each wave a dance of luminous light.

Within its depths lie dreams unbounded,
Stories of sailors lost and found,
And I, with my feet in the sand,
Feel the heartbeat of its endless song,
Unraveling time’s fragile thread.

- Richard Aldington
