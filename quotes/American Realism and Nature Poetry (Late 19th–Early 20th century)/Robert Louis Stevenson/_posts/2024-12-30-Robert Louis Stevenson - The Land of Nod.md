The Land of Nod
From breakfast on through all the day  
At home among my friends I stay  
But every night I go abroad  
A secret land of Nod.

I lift my eyes to see the stars  
To walk through fields of moonlight bars  
I wander in a twilight grove  
In a land I dream to love.

The sound of leaves on distant hills  
Whispers the secrets that nature spills,  
And all my cares, I leave behind  
As I embrace the peace I find.




- Robert Louis Stevenson
