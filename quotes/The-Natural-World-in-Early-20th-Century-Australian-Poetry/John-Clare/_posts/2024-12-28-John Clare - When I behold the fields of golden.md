When I behold the fields of golden maize,
The swaying stalks that in the breezes sway,
I muse on life, a tapestry that plays,
The lute of time across the azure sway.

The twilight hues drape gently o’er the hills,
As orbèd night enfolds the cypress and the pine;
Where crickets chirp, and ev’ning's chill fulfills,
I wander lost, in nature's soft, divine.

With stars that gaze from heaven’s velvet dome,
I find my solace in the world so wide;
My heart a vessel that sails from home,
With nature’s grace, my spirit turns the tide.

- John Clare
