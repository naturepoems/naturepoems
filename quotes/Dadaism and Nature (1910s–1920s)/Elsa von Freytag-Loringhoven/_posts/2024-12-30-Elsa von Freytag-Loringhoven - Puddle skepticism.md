Puddle skepticism,
    wafting vapors,
   gnashes the earth's
   impatient rawness;
   a sea of clover,
   quaking in
   squinting sunlight.
   Wipe your feet,
   sooty when
   you step towards remembering the beetle’s
   crystal chains,
   in gardens bending in laughter.

- Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven
