The Green Thumb

There is something of the forest,

as I bring dust to the woods.

Here now have been marked,

a park of solids to grow,

young trees greened the space,

that life was bright and vivid,

like few flowers in bloom,

when day breaks to life

and the retrogression expands—

and I speak with fairness to cherish

both my left and right feet,

the extremes rich as each entirety age

while palpable roots structure along

a spine, against threatening elms,

as all space embraces and harmonizes

and confounded jumpers of color;

more light than is allowed,

this in-born wisdom.

Both men, or matter,

delirious as day is pride,

for the gentle ones, sprouting.

They are feet in ease,

gradually taking the measure of time,

yet not turbulent, making admirable roots,

in galleries finely defined,

over and then through trails of arch,

for yet beyond it’s there nameless,

last appearances of joy and joylessness.




- Marianne Moore
