When the sun kisses the horizon,
a blush of orange spills into the sky,
it pools with the gold of land,
a canvas of eveningâ€™s embrace.
The shadows dance as daylight wanes,
casting a symphony of colors,
a farewell to the brilliance
each day births anew.

I hold the warmth in my palms,
this fleeting moment in time,
celebrating the end of day,
a promise to rise again.
And as darkness twinkles with stars,
iare they not the tears of light?
a reminder that even in shadows,
there is beauty in transformation.

- Pablo Neruda
