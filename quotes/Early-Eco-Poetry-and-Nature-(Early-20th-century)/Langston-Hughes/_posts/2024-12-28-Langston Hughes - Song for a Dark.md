Song for a Dark Girl

Way Down South in Dixie,
    Benighted and yet unbroken,
    I found a girl whose skin was black,
    And her name was Dark Girl.

Way Down South in Dixie,
    Betwixt the trees and the rivers,
    Little dark girl who's still alive,
    Your heart's a dark river, love.

She lived in the shadow of the pines,
    She followed the light of the stars,
    And melted like a lily white moon.
    Ah, you smile so sweet, dark girl.

- Langston Hughes
