Acquainted with the Night
I have been one acquainted with the night.
I have walked out in rainâ€”and back in rain.
I have outwalked the furthest city light.

I have looked down the saddest city lane.
I have passed by the watchman on his duty.
The moon is a block of faces, air,
And I am gone across that block, unbroken.

- Robert Frost
