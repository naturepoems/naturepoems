Hyperion

Deep in the shady sadness of a vale,  
Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,  
Far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star,  
Sat gray-haired Saturn, quiet as a stone,
Still as the silence round about his lair,  
In a vast wilderness of thorny weeds,
And of such bitter grapes, as were borne  
By his great life, he has known the dark sea.

He sat as in a dream, upon a rock,  
Admitting dark things from the deepening shade. 
It could not be, yet, conquer to have known  
A softened beast, or beauty's smile of grace. 

â€” Hyperion

- John Keats
