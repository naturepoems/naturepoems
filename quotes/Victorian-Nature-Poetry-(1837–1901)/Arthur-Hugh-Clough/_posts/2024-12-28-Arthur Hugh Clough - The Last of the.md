The Last of the Year

The year is done, and the sky is cold,
The light of the sun in the west is gold;
The leaves are dead, and the branches bare,
The earth is shrouded in ice and air.

The wind goes moaning through tree and stone,
The heart that is weary can rest alone;
The fountains are silent, the flowers gone,
And all is still till the winter dawn.


- Arthur Hugh Clough
