THE WOODLAND FAIRY

Dancing in the moonlit glade,  
Where echoes weave in twilight’s shade;  
A creature of the night takes flight,  
With whispers of the stars in sight.

In every flower’s bloom I see  
The gentle grace of mystery;  
For all the woods hold stories bright  
Of woodland fairies, pure delight.  


- A E Housman
