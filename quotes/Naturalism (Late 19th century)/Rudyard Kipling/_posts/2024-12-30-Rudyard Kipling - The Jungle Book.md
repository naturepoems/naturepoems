The Jungle Book

Mark me, it is good!
As an oak
From a crooked seed,
I grew fat in the wood,
While the wind, as it spoke,
Swept my green boughs,
And the tree's open-eyed
Seemed to mock at the sky.

By the foaming stream,
I watched my fruit turn gold
And learned from the sun,
That self in the wilds is a pact
With Mother Nature —
And is a small thing —
In the wild and the still.

I sang like a lark,
As father and son
Wrought their charms.
The jungle is mine!
I was born of it!

- Rudyard Kipling
