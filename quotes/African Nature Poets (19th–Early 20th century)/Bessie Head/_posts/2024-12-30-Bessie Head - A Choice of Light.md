A CHOICE OF LIGHT  
The sun breaks against the dark,  
Shining through the leaves,  
It is a glorious choice,  
This morning, filled with light.  

I hear the birds a-singing,  
In harmony,  
Love fills the shadows,  
And the hopes of yesterday  
Flourish in this day’s embrace.  

I choose to walk  
In the brightness of today,  
To seek out the miracles,  
And find my place in the earth,  
To be alive and free.  


- Bessie Head
