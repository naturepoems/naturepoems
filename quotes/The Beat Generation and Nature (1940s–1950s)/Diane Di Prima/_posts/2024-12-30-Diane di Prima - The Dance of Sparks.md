The Dance of Sparks

In the fading light,
ative flames lick the air,
in a ritual of warmth,
a dance of sparks
that leap and swirl,
boundless and free,

reflecting on the faces
of those gathered,
in a celebration of moments—
this is life,
youth feels eternal,
more potent than fire,
burning away the spaces
between us.

As the trees watch,
quiet witnesses to this heat,
a chorus of owls serenade the night,
reminding us,
we are all of a piece,
a shudder of dreams,
filling the spaces
with longing and release.
