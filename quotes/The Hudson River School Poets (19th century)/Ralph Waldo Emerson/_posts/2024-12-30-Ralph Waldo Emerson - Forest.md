Forest

In wandering ways of leaf-strewn walks,
The forests breathe mist from lullabies,
Where secrets whisper through the talking rocks,
And sunlight dazzles silver drops from skies.

The ferns embrace the starlit shaded grief,
Sandâ€™s dew drapes fresh each moment found.
This ether, light as air is but belief,
It hints of Heaven swept slightly around.

So tread upon these corridors of shade,
Invoke the sprees in dusk that dwell, immortal.
Where life ascends and all mysteries parade: ability, so you could not dare, entranced unequaled!

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
