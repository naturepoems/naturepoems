A Prayer for My Daughter  
I see a little kid grow straight and true  
As bending trees obey the winds a-whistle.  
Their trunks are strong, their branches tell what’s due  
To every flower and open bud and thistle.  
Oh may she learn from Nature's honesty,  
To stand for what is right and for what’s fair.

- Joyce Kilmer
