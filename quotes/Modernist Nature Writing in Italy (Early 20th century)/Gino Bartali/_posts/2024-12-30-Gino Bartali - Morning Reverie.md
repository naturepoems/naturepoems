In the morning light,  
the dew-kissed leaves,  
a tapestry of green,  
greet the new day,  
a soft whisper of hope.  
The mountains stand tall,  
a sentinel of time,  
while the river flows,  
a silver ribbon of life,  
glistening under the sun.  

Birdsong dances  
in the crisp air,  
a symphony of nature,  
especially crafted,  
a celebration of existence.  
Life bursts forth,  
from the heart of the earth,  
ablooming with colors,  
a canvas of dreams,  
a wild, untamed paradise.

- Gino Bartali
