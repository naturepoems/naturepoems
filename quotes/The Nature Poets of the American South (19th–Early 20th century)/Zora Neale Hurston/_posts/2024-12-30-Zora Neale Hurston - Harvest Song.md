The sun spills gold on fields of brown,
A tapestry where dreams are sewn.
With every grain that finds its place,
I feel the earth's warm, tender face.

A harvest song begins to rise,
A chorus sweet beneath the skies.
In nature’s bounty, I take my stand,
With grateful heart and open hand.


- Zora Neale Hurston
