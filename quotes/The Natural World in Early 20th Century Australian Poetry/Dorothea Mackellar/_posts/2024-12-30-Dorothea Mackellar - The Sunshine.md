The Sunshine
The warmth on my face and my eyes  
Tinged with the hue of despair,
While the shadows around me  
Flee like dreams of fresh air.

The sun's rays flickering like laughter,
Dancing on leaves bright and new,
And whispering tales of tomorrow,
To all that is seen and the few.

- Dorothea Mackellar
