Once more the crocus from the sod,
Once more the sun’s returning ray
Brings news of life to reconcile,
The thirsty land and bless the day.

Yet when the blossoms’ hues display,
And fragrant breezes stir the air,
Melodious answers wake the May,
In nature’s bosom everywhere.

The trees are clad in vestments bright,
The merry birds are out and sing,
While blooms of daisies yet in sight
Bring joy, for Nature's sweet in spring.

- James Russell Lowell
