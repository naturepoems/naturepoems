Beech, Black

In the blue mist of morning
on the lake, forgotten
in the hurry of moving.
A will of its own, there,
a beech, bent and gnarled by
weather, yet spangled white
with blooms, almost
menacing in its buoyant
attempt to burst.
Winter can linger still in
this blue mist, but the
blooming beech knows.
