When lavender skies meet the dawn,
In every blossom, life is drawn;
The fragrance wafts on summer air,
A moment captured, pure and rare.

Beneath the boughs, the shadows weave,
In gentle light, we seek and believe;
Each time we share this sacred space,
A bond is formed in nature’s grace.

So here we stand, hand in hand, so true,
Amongst the wildflowers, bathed anew.
In every petal, every sigh,
We find the beauty, love shall fly.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
