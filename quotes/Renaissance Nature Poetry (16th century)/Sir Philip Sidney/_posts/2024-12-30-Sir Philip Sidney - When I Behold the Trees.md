When I behold the trees aglow,  
In the winter’s silver show—  
How the leaves wear icy crowns,  
Like soft jewels on their downs!  
Every whisper in the cold  
Of the secrets they have told.

Here I find a beauty rare,  
In the stillness, everywhere!  
Let me take this moment’s grace,  
In the heart of nature’s face!

- Sir Philip Sidney
