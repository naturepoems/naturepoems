A Spring Day

In a sunny, gentle morn,
When the branches drip with dew,
And a fragrance, light as fawn,
Fills the soul for joys anew.

In the perfect blooms of spring,
All the world seems fair and free,
In the air, the thrushes sing,
And the sky meets land at sea.

Every heart beats in the light,
Where the flowers dance and sway,
And with every matter bright,
Itâ€™s a splendid spring day!

- Henry Lawson
