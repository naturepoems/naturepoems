Whispers of the Stream

In gentle flows, the waters gleam,
A silver thread, a tranquil dream,
The whispers of the stream, they sigh,
With secrets kept, and lullabies.

Amongst the stones, the light will dance,
In nature's arms, I find my chance,
To lose the world, to breathe, to be,
In every drop, a harmony.

- N Nu Maoridom
