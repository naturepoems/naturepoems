An April's Promise

When April unfolds in its beauty so bright,
And the world awakens from slumbering dreams;
In the soft, gentle rains, the tender daylight,
Nature gifts us with life, amid bubbling streams.

The buds break the ground in their eager delight,
And the blossoms bloom forth with a colorful grin;
While the creatures arise from their wintery flight,
In the warmth of the sun, where new life will begin.

There’s magic afoot in this season aglow,
Where each petal unfurls like a flag to the skies;
In the dance of the flowers, as they sway to and fro,
We behold all the wonders of nature, so wise.

Oh, the promises woven in this season's heart,
Where the fragrance of hope fills the air and the earth;
In the embrace of the spring, we will never depart,
For the essence of life finds its grand, joyful birth.

- Thomas Chalmers
