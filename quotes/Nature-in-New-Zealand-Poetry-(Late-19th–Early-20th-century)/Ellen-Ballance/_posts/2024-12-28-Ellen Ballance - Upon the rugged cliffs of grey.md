Upon the rugged cliffs of grey,  
Where tufts of green cling to the stone,  
The ocean licks the parched earth's face,  
And in that dance, both wild and free,  
The restless tide speaks loud and clear,  
Of life’s unending ebb and flow,  
And how the storms can shift our course,  
Yet beauty always finds its way home.

- Ellen Ballance
