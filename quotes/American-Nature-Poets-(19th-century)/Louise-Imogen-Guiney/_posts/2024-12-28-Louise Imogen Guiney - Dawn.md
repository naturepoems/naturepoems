Dawn
The sun breaks softly on the hill,
With hues of gold that linger still,
As dewdrops glisten, faintly bright,
Awakening the world to light.
The flowers stretch, their petals wide,
As nature wakes with gentle pride,
Each day a canvas, fresh and new,
Where skies embrace the morning blue.

- Louise Imogen Guiney
