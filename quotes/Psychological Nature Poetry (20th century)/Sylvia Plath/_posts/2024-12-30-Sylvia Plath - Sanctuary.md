In a garden of shadows, I roam,
  Through labyrinthine paths,
  Grazing on fragrant whispers
  That bloom here under this sun.
  Each flower, a promise kissed up to heaven,
  Each leaf, cradling the tiniest drop of rainâ€”
  In this sanctuary,
  I let go of the burdens,
  And breathe the life around me, still.

- Sylvia Plath
