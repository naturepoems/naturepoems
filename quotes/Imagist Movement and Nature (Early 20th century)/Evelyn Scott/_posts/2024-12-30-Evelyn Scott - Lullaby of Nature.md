In pools of sunlight, moments scatter,
Fleeting glances of pure delight,
As petals dance upon soft breezes,
And nature takes each grateful sigh.
In the soft embrace of evening's glow,
We hold tight the beauty of now,
Where the world finds peace, in nature's soft humâ€”
A lullaby beyond time.

- Evelyn Scott
