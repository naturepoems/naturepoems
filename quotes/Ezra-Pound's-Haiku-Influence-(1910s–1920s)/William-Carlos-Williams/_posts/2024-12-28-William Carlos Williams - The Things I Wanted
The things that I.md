quote: "The Things I Wanted
The things that I wanted

have changed.

The white lilies,
sunlight, and crimson fades—

on far fields,
and honey rain of dusk

holds my heart.

Only this to take—

to return as spring
on reeds of my longing."

The Things I Wanted
The things that I wanted

have changed.

The white lilies,
sunlight, and crimson fades—

on far fields,
and honey rain of dusk

holds my heart.

Only this to take—

to return as spring
on reeds of my longing.

- William Carlos Williams
