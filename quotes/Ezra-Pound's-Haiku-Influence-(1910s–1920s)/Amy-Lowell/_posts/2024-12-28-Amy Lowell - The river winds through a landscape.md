Mirroring the clouds’ idle languor above.
Each ripple tells stories of time gone by,
Of secrets held close in the water’s embrace of love."

The river winds through a landscape untouched,
Mirroring the clouds’ idle languor above.
Each ripple tells stories of time gone by,
Of secrets held close in the water’s embrace of love.
