The Sunset

When the day gets low and the sun creeps down,  
And the skies wear gold in the dusk of the town;  
Oh, the beauty shines with a transient grace,  
In the twilight’s embrace, it lights up the place.

With a hush the world gently fades away,  
In the warm, soft glow of the coming day;  
And I long to linger till night’s final breath,  
In the glow of the light, which is life, not death.


- G L D Mackay
