The Garden

The garden speaks,
at twilight with whispers
and hidden sighs;
when flowers drift like thoughts
and clouds appear
like lost verses.
The moon rests like a
forgotten promise
only stars gather
into lines of blooming trees,
where night is an embrace
dan defense against the day,
a soothing lullaby roaming free.
