To the moon’s gloss, blooms
   tremble, amplifying
   rhythms unheard.
   The lash of evening
   caresses every leaf,
   quill'd applause
   fluttering
   across the fields.
   Nature’s poems in
   woven thread;
   glide past green illusions.
   Below the stars,
   violate time for thirst.

- Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven
