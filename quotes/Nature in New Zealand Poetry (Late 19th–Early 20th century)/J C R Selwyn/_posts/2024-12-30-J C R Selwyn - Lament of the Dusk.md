Lament of the Dusk
As dusk descends upon the day,
With shadows deep and colors gray,
I feel the sorrow of the light,
As stars emerge to claim the night.

The whispers of a gentle breeze,
Speak softly through the swaying trees,
A lullaby of peace and calm,
To soothe the heart, to cradle balm.

Yet in this time, a heart must mourn,
For daylight fades and dreams are born,
The cycle turns, as all must do,
In every end, a newness grew.

O dusky hour, your grace I keep,
In tender thoughts, I often weep,
For all that fades, a chance to grow,
In every twilight’s gentle glow.

- J C R Selwyn
