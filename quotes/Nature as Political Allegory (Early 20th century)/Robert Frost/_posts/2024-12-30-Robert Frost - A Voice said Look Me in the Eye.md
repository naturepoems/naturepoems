A voice said, look me in the eye, 
And I will look at you for a morning;  
The warm hand laid mine:
Thus, a night is not all white, but cerulean blue,  
I will catch your thoughts.  

A star rises from the meadowing hills,
A world opened by the softest light.
And the hour has come,
Let the pasture be cut, 
Let water creep, let rain be made.

- Robert Frost
