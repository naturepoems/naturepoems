Life in Bloom
Where blossoms bloom, life starts anew,
In every petal, a world of hue.
Nature’s palette, vibrant and bright,
Awakens the beauty in my sight.

Gardens flourish, scents entwine,
In floral whispers, hearts align.
With every fragrance, a passing breeze,
Life's sweet moments, nature's keys.
