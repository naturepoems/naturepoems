Our roots forever entwined,
each moment grounded in memory,
every page of life scribed
in the soft light of dawn,
a canvas alive with colors,
a reflection of each fractal within.

Show me how to see, to touch,
the heartbeat of dust,
the laughter of leaves,
in this intricate web weaving
between the great and the small,
each piece a part of our song.

- Bessie Head
