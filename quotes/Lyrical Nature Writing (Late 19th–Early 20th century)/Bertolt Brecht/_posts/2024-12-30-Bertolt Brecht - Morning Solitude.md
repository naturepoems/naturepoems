Morning Solitude

Awake, as the first light creeps,
carrying warmth into the night,
casting shadows, thin and pale,
a herald of the new day,
filled with colors unspoken.

The birds take flight,
like dreams breaking free,
sweet melodies spring,
into the air, sweet and pure,
a chorus of life,
embellishing the dawn.

As I sit in silence,
i feel the world breathe,
exhaling its echoes,
gifting me this moment,
a solitude cradled
in nature’s embrace,
reminding me,
that even in stillness,
there is a narrative deep,
a communion with the dance
of every living thing.

- Bertolt Brecht
