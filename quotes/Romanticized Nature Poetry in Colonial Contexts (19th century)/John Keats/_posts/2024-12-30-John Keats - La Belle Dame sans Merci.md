La Belle Dame sans Merci

O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
   Alone and palely loitering? 
The sedge has wither’d from the lake,
   And no birds sing.

O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
   So haggard and so woe-begone? 
The squirrel’s granary is full,
   And the harvest’s done.

I see a lily on thy brow
   With anguish moist and fever dew, 
And on thy cheek a fading rose
   Fast withereth too.

I met a lady in the meads,
   Full beautiful— a faery's child, 
Her hair was long, her foot was light,
   And her eyes were wild.

I made a garland for her head,
   And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
She look’d at me as she did love,
   And made sweet moan.

I set her on my pacing steed
   And nothing else saw all day long,
For sideways would she lean, and sing
   A faery's song.

She found me roots of relish sweet,
   And honey wild, and manna dew,
And sure in language strange she said—
   “I love thee true.”

She took me to her elfin cave,
   And there she wept, and sigh’d full sore,
And there I shut her wild, sad eyes
   With kisses four.

And there she lulled me asleep,
   And there I dreamed—Ah! woe betide!—
The latest dream I ever dream’d
   On the cold hill’s side.

I saw pale kings and princes too,
   Pale warriors, death-pale were they all; 
They cried—“La Belle Dame sans Merci
   Hath thee in thrall!”

Then I awoke, and found me here,
   On the cold hill’s side,
And this is why I sojourn here,
   Alone and palely loitering,
Though the sedge is wither’d from the lake,
   And no birds sing.

- John Keats
