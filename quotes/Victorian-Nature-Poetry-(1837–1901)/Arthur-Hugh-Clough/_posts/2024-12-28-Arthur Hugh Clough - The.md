The Woodlands

Through woodlands dark I wandering went,
   With echoes like a sigh;
The shadows deep where the sun has lent,
   A glance of light and die.

A silence fell where the branches twined,
   And here the leaves were stirred;
In whispers soft, I seemed to find
   The music of every bird.


- Arthur Hugh Clough
