A Grave

I am not I, I am this

        An island


In a river, waves will come,

And I will remain.


I am not my body,

   I am this land,


Eddying, full of life.

I am not a promise;

   I am a wave.


A melanistic joke;

        This reptile

Starts as the sun goes down.

   And I am                             then.


- Marianne Moore
