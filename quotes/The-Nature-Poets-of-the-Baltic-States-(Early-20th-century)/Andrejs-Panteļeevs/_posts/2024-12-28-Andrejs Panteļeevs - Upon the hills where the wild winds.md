Upon the hills, where the wild winds roam,
And echoes of silence reign supreme,
Each breeze carries tales from a far-off home,
Nestled in the fabric of a vibrant dream.

The sky folds the horizon in hues so warm,
A canvas painted with the colors of light,
Here, under the watchful eye of the storm,
Nature writes verses in the heart of the night.

- Andrejs Panteļeevs
