THE MOONLIGHT

The moonlight gleams on forest deep,
And tenderly it bathes the stream,
With silver threads of softest glow,
That waken all the world from dream.

Oh hush, my heart! The night is near,
With nature's peace laid out before:
The stars, like scattered innocent joys,
Have lit the skies forevermore.

So let us wander, side by side,
With every whispered word set free,
In moonlight's grace our souls unite,
In nature's song, in harmony!

- Lydia Maria Child
