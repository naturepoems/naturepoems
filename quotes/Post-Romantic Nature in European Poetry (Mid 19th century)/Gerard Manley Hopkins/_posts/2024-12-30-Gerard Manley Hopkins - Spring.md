Spring

Nothing is so beautiful as spring—
  When all things wake, and hereabout
  It does not take an incident or an hour,
  But each flashing and beckoning hour is day.
  This is because of the swift glass without,
  That catches the sun’s golden embrace.
  So it is in the curling crocus bud,
  But this closing and breaking open brings:
  The circle of summers shatters; gleaming dawn.


- Gerard Manley Hopkins
