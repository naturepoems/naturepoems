The Folly of Being Wise
The wiser I become, my dear,
The less I understand your soul,
Or all that clings, true nature dear,
Of what gives life a fuller role.

Shall I endure the weak afflictions,
Or let prescience roam near reflection,
Like wastes of seed, to fall off strands?
And still the waves roll to the shore!

The moon shall shine on hour’s wasted throng,
Yet deeper, storms bringing not the seas,
The better part accepts forever wrong,
Until the shore alone recalls from these.

- William Butler Yeats
