Summer Rain

In the warm embrace of summer,  
The rain falls as a gentle hymn,
Awakening the slumbering earth,
Each drop kisses the soil,  
Caressing flowers—  
The world drinks with joy.

The fragrance of life explodes,  
With each thunderous clap—  
The heart of nature beats louder,  
As I stand beneath the sky,  
A child of the rain,  
Dancing through wild puddles.


- Robert Bly
