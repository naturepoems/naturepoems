There is a time, evergreen,
  When earth sinks quiet,
  Rich with the scent of loam,
  Tucked beneath a soft white quilt,
  Where the creatures burrow deep,
  Waiting for the stir of dawn’s promise — 
  As I lay here beside the flowers,
  Listening, quiet, joyful.
  Spring does not forget its way back.

- Sylvia Plath
