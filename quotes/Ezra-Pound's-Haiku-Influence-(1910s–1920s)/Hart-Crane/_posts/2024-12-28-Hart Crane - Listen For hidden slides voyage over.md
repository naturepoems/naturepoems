To wrap the sights and sounds of liquid yearn,
A constant curve in Earth's vastness nests; 
To hear the grasses run, while heavy seasons turn."

Listen! For hidden slides voyage over crests,
To wrap the sights and sounds of liquid yearn,
A constant curve in Earth's vastness nests; 
To hear the grasses run, while heavy seasons turn.

- Hart Crane
