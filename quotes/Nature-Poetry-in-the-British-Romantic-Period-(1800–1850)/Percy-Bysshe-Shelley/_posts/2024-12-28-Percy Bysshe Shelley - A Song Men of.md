A Song: Men of England
Men of England, wherefore plough
For the lords who lay ye low?
Wherefore weave with toil and care
The garment ye shall never wear?

Wherefore, feed and clothe and shield
Your lordly masters on the field?
Wherefore, bled and could not yield
To create the wombs of the fields?

The wealth of men walks in the soil,
From their pains hath grown this soil:
And how long shall you be denied,
For the fruit of the fields put aside?

The day is coming when all shall rise
And claim their due beneath the skies.
To the fields we have grown with love
And be free with union’s heart above.


- Percy Bysshe Shelley
