A Love Song

I must set my heart to day,
As fern will send forth scent of brine,
To take up time in wavy strain—
And through the quench pool’s dew entwine;
My heart can still be thine thine thine!

So artless, please let close me pass—
Rope-thickened spires will not hold trust,
Yet as swift as clouds my love shall flee,
For woods are bound to make a must—
Where euu and she are thine thine thine!

- Thomas Hardy
