Where shadows linger in the dappled woods,
And sunlight weaves through leaves of gold,
There lies a beauty, ancient and good,
In the quiet moments, in stories untold.

The rustle of branches, the whisper of streams,
Convey secrets of nature, of life intertwined,
In wild, hidden places, we gather our dreams,
Where time has no shackles, nor purpose defined.

Amongst the tall grasses and blooms of the day,
We breathe in the essence of time slipping by,
Lost in the warmth of the slow, golden rays,
In the heart of the wild, beneath the broad sky.

For nature is music, and language, and art,
A symphony played in the rustle and sigh,
As it beckons to all who would pause and take part,
In the eternal dance of life passing by.

- Willa Cather
