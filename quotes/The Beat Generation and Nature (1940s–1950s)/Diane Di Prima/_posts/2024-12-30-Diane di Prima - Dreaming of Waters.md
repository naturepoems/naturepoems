Dreaming of Waters

Awake to the sound
of water,
it splashes against rocks,
a reminder of time,
endless flowing,
the core of all cycles,

as it ebbs and flows,
whispers of journeys taken,
a life lived,
each drop a moments,
yearning to drop,
as the essence of the heart.

Dreaming of waters,
it washes over me,
grateful for the cool touch,
its embrace,
each wave a breath of life,
each river a new beginning.

Forever searching,
I feel the pull,
the great collective longing,
where we all find our undying connection,
where we all belong,
carried away on a stream
of poetry,
a flow I cannot escape.
