Advent
I heard the bell tolling, and I paused,
And stretched my hand to the window; far below
The shadowy trees were spangled white with frost.
Heaven took the people from me, and I tread
The path of wanderers or of those who pass,
And all I saw was the worldâ€™s beauty fled.

And every evening set with purple light,
A candle burning on an altar cast
Glorious shadows round my heart, that light,
That shape of the Beloved and the Night,
Is there beneath the veil of woodland grass
And in the courses the gray mountains wear.

- William Butler Yeats
