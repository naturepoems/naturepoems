The Flower

Soft petals, bright,
  look up to the sun.
They wait and unfold,
  thrust against the wind,
each leaf holding history,
  warmth from raining clouds.
The earth nourishes them,
  while they reach high,
climbing still,
  the clear blue sky,
a soft heart that opens,
  bliss of a bright bloom.


- Robert Creeley
