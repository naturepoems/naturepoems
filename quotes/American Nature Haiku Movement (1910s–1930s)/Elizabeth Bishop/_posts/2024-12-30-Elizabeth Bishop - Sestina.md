Sestina

September rain falls on the house.
In the failing light, the old grandmother
sits in the kitchen with the child
beside the Little Marvel Stove,
reading the jokes from the almanac,
watching the wooden dummy
guess the wrong answers.

The old grandmother
sits in the kitchen with the child
beside the Little Marvel Stove,
reading the jokes from the almanac,
watching the wooden dummy
guess the wrong answers.

All the rain
seems to have grown
into flowers, into clouds
over the mountain, over the town.
And the trees, survey the land
to Everything that waits.
Our eyes raised heavenward,
the sky remains ablaze.

- Elizabeth Bishop
