Beside the stream, where daisies grow,
   The gentle sway of nature's hand;
With every petal kissed by flow,
   A whisper of the earth’s command.

Here, time stands still, the moments weave,
   A tapestry of love and peace;
Come, heed the magic of believe,
   In nature’s heart, our souls release.


- L M T Aitken
