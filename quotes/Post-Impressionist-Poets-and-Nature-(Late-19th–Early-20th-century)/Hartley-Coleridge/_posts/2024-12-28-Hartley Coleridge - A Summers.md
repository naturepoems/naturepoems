A Summer's Day
When the bright sun shines on the green fields,
And the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
When the flowers unfold in sweetbriar yields,
And the honey-bee hums on the breeze;
Ah! then it is sweet to sit in the shade,
And to ponder on all that Life yields,
To drink in the fragrance of Nature made,
And to rest in her lap 'mid the flowered fields.

- Hartley Coleridge
