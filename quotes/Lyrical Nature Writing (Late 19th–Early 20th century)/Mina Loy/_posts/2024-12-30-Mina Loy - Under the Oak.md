I sit beneath the ancient oak,
Its branches spread like thoughts over my head,
A cathedral of leaves,
Whispering prayers of unfurling life.
The call of the cicadas,
The slow turn of seasons rolling,
Bringing forth the fragrance of autumn’s harvest,
And the warmth of a remembered summer breeze.
Let me return to this communion,
To become a shadow among shadows,
A drifting seed, carried on winds,
Each moment a bloom, a music of being.
Here, enclosed in nature’s arms,
Ephemeral and eternal—
Is where my heart sings.

- Mina Loy
