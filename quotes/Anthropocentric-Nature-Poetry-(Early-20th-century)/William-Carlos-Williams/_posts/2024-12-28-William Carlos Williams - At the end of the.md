At the end of the path,
  the dawn's light breaks,
  painting the day anew,
  as these fragile blooms
  awaken with desire,
  inhaling every promise. 

  In the scattered shadows,
  their hearts align,
  in harmony with the garden, 
  a blush of color fills 
  the waiting dawn.

- William Carlos Williams
