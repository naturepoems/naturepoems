Nightfall

The stars rise slowly from the sea,
And the night wind hums a tune,
The world becomes a tapestry,
Woven silently by the moon.

I linger in the dusk of evening,
Where shadows stretch along the ground;
Each moment feels like a soft, fleeting,
Dream where solace can be found.

- Sara Teasdale
