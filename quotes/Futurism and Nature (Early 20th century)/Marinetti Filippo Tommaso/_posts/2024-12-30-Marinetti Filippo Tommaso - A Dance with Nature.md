A Dance with Nature
Come, oh earthy pang!  
conscious of my hands’ caress  
breath with me!  
The trees rustle, giving birth  
to scintillating dreams,  
transformed by choicelessness!

Let the wind dictate  
the movement of joy;  
I will suffocate oceans  
at the end of my fingertips,  
do you see them dance?

In rock and shadow,
yesterday’s glow emerges,  
grateful insects slip away,  
nature warms my silence,  
while flames flower!

Cry with me,  
we shall tumble with the stars!

- Marinetti Filippo Tommaso
