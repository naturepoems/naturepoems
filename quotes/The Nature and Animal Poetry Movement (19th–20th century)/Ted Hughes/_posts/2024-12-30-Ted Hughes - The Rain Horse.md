The Rain Horse

Brightly, through aged valleys,
He strides, half-stepping into the rain—
That pore where the wild spills,
Hooves struck a cadence of fervent yests,
Yet drift on gentle hills.
His coat glistens, unleashing memories
Lit by fire, by dancing semaphores
That spring from togetherness
And course through the sphere of flesh 
Struck from air.
I count myself among those echoes—
A marked shadow, drawing breath,
Each trot, each gallop called back, takes,
This rain wraps us fully, blends past wishes
Where life and praise unite,
And glide on through narrow trails. 


- Ted Hughes
