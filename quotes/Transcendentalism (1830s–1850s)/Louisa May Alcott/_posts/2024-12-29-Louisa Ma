Through twilight's veil the shadows creep,  
While whispering winds weave soft their spell;  
In Nature's heart, my thoughts will leap,  
And find the peace of where I dwell.  
For in the stars that light the night,  
And in the dawn’s first golden ray,  
Is comfort bound with pure delight,  
To guide my heart along the way.  
So sing of life and love’s reward,  
In mellow tones of twilight's grace;  
For in the nature's grand accord,  
We find our sacred, timeless place.

- Louisa May Alcott
