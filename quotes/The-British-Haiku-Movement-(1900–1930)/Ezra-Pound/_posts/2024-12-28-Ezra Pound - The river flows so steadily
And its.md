quote: "The river flows so steadily,
And its quiet murmur is a song of peace,
Underneath a sky that’s painted soft blue,
Dancing willows sway in the gentle breeze.
Such moments hold the world in quiet calm,
As nature sings of life in sacred balm."

The river flows so steadily,
And its quiet murmur is a song of peace,
Underneath a sky that’s painted soft blue,
Dancing willows sway in the gentle breeze.
Such moments hold the world in quiet calm,
As nature sings of life in sacred balm.
