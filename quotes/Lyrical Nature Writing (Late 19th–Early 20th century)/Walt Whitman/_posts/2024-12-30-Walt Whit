Ode to a Nightingale (Excerpt)

My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
   My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
   One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
   But being too happy in thine happiness,—
      That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees
   In some melodious plot
   Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,
   Singest of summer in full-throated ease.

...

- Walt Whitman
