The Psalm of Life

Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
  Life is but an empty dream!
For the soul is dead that slumbers,
  And things are not what they seem.

Life is real! Life is earnest!
  And the grave is not its goal;
Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
  Was not spoken of the soul.

"For tho' the course of life may vary,
  And trials upon us be,
Thereâ€™s beauty in the wild to carry,
  Nature's grip hold me free.".

Be in relation with beauty vast,
  For not a flower in vain,
Let heart meet heaven's soaring cast,
  With passions that affirm gain.

- James Russell Lowell
