The Skaters  
The skaters—that happy throng—  
How the merry bells ring out  
Their jocund note; and while they'll sing,  
The chopper see, and with doubt,  
Fears not, beneath the oaks and pines,  
Whose branches drape the frozen lakes,  
They glide with joy in meridian climes,  
And laugh like children, with many wakes.

- Leigh Hunt
