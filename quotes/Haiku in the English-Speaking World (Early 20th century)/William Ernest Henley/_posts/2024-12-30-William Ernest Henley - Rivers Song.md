The river flows, a silver thread,
Winding through green, where life is fed,
It sparkles bright beneath the sun,
A dance of waters, 'til day is done.

By its banks, the willow weeps,
For secrets that the current keeps,
And frogs croak songs of ancient lore,
While dragonflies boast by the shore.

- William Ernest Henley
