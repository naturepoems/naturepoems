As twilight bathes the world in peace,
The nightingale begins her tune,
In whispers soft, the heart's release,
Beneath the watchful, silver moon.

As stars emerge, the sky ignites,
A canvas vast of dreams held tight,
In natureâ€™s breath, my soul ignites,
In every note, a spark of light.

- Gerhard Gran
