After Apple-Picking
My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still, and there's a barrel that I didn't fill
Beside it, and a cup, too, full of apple-picking.

I am done with apple-picking now.  (It wonâ€™t be long)
Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.

I cannot shake the shimmer from my eye
Or, while I sleep, keep watch for the sun on the horizon.

- Robert Frost
