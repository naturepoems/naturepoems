The Flowers—of the Field  
No other sight is sweeter—  
Near withered brims of bloom  
I see their hearts of Summer—  

Another time, another Day,  
They'll blossom o'er the air—  
They stand beside the Fragrant Hearth—  
I cannot see them there—  

An Hour—somewhat will yield  
To Nature's garden!  
And if it brings no surprise—  
For licorice would love the time!  


- Emily Dickinson
