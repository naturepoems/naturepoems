The Forest

What a strange thing is the forest.
It is not inhabited,
Man is just a shadow
Among the trees,
A curled-up leaf
Torn from the upper branches.

Fallen petals fall softly,
The earth yawns, pushes forth
New sprouts and sickly flowers.
To me, until now
It is an act of faith,
Yet another form of shipwreck,
Where fog swallows
The edges of the universe.

Let the wild beasts roam free
In the depths of winter's palace,
The forest forever breathing,
Where nothing is as it seems.


- Richard Huelsenbeck
