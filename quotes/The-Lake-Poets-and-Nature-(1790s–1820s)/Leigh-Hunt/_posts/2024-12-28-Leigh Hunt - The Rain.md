The Rain  
Rain through the trees! Divine art thou!  
The beauty flowing from above  
Is rapture pure. O, breathe, bow down,  
O, power of life!  O, love,  
That in thy name the flowers spring;  
That calls the birds on airy wing,  
To warble in the fragrant grove,  
And sing of all which we must love!  
Go, bid the lilies grow. Distil  
Sweet scents, like heaven, from the hill!

- Leigh Hunt
