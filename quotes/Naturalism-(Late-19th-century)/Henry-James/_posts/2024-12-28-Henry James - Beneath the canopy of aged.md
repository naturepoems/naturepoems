Beneath the canopy of aged oak,
I find a world where the silence spoke;
Each leaf a volume, each branch a tale,
In the whispering woods where wonders prevail.

The dappled light dances on the ground,
While echoes of the forest resound;
In every rustling, a secret shared,
With the earth's embrace, I am ensnared.


- Henry James
