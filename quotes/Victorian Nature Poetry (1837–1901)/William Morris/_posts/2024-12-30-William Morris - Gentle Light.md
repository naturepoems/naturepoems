O gentle light that pours so fair,
Upon the meadows green and bright;
With every breeze upon the air,
Your warmth is rising up to flight.

Oh let me linger in the sun,
Where flowers bloom to paint the ground,
And softly speak, till day is done,
With love that breathes in every sound.

- William Morris
