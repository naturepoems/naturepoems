After great pain, a formal feeling comes –  
The nerves sit ceremonious, like tombs –  
The stiff Heart questions, was it He, that bore  
And was it Love – to deal the way –  

And endless Body – the faintest breath –  
At least it breaks the Ice – and swells the calm –  
And should it last – will you me keep?  
For time can turn again –  


- Emily Dickinson
