An Invitation to Go

Let’s take the road,
let’s take it high,
let’s wander through the mountains,
of mysteries unknown,
of nature’s embrace,
come alive.

The rivers twist and turn,
a dance of clarity,
while the stars gaze down,
gifting us silence,
gifting us wisdom,
God's unknown beauty.  

We’ll seek
where the fireflies flicker,
where the wildflowers bloom,
let the earth unfold her arms,
and wrap us in her twilight
as we drift off to dream,
to become more alive,
in the spirit of exploration.
