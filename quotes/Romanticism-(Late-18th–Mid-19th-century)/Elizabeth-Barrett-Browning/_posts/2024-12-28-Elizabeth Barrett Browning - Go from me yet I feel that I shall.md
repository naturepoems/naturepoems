---

Go from me, yet I feel that I shall stand
Henceforth in thy shadow, as now I do
A stranger to thy essence vast and grand,
Yet mindful of a joy I knew in you.

Could you have looked into the very truth
Of things that you may with me clasp, I know,
You would still keep the faith of my small youth,
The flower of her whose scent was all aglow.

But lost the day shall ever be for me;
Now dreads the hour of wayward joys forlorn,
Let Beautiful nights drift again and—be!
As beauty in nature walks from night’s reborn.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
