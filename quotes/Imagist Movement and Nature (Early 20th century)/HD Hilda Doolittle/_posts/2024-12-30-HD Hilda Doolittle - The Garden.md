The Garden

The garden
that we set apart
to become you,
    this garden
of our garden,
and each of us in season
yesterday,
    today and tomorrow
    for the garden’s breath,
our leaves take dust by dust
and bloom in
    the strength of the sunlight.

Let all darkness cease!
    Put on your blossom,
while our sweet fruits descend,
pink and lovely fruit,
and partake of
    the garden’s quiet.

A moist, pale flower,
taped by the low sun
    makes food for the flower,
sweet and light as air.

- HD Hilda Doolittle
