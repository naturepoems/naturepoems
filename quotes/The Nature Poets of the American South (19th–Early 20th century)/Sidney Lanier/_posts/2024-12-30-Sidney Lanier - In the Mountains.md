In the Mountains
O, though the mountains lift to earth
  The sweet perfume of pine,
I breathe the air of heaven’s worth,
  The notes of nature mine.

For I see the clouds drift gladly by,
  In phantom whispers place,
And hear the shadows’ echoes rise,
  As wild hearts need their space.

The evening nestles ‘neath the stars,
  The heavens electrified,
And nature, oh in rhythmic bars,
  From my heart cannot hide.

- Sidney Lanier
