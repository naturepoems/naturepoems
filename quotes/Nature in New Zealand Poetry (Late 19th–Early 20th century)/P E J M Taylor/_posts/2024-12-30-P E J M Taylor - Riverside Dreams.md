Riverside Dreams

At the river's edge, I find my peace,  
In the flow of the water, sorrows release,  
With each gentle current, my spirit takes flight,  
In the love of the land, everything feels right.

The rush of the river sings songs of the past,  
Memories echo as long shadows cast,  
In the glint of the sunlight, our laughter flows,  
Where the heart feels alive, and nature bestows.

So let us wander, hand in hand by the stream,  
Where the river reflects every cherished dream,  
In the dance of the light and the song of the breeze,  
We celebrate life, in moments like these.

- P E J M Taylor
