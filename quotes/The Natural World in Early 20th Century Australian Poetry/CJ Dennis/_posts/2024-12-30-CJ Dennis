The Flowering Vine

Oh, vine that climbs the sunlit wall,
   In beauty’s soft embrace,
You weave a tapestry of life,
   In every blooming space.

With colors rich and fragrant breath,
   You teach us how to grow,
To reach for heights we never thought,
   To let our spirits flow.

So let us nurture lovely vines,
   That bloom in strength and grace,
For nature’s heart entwines us all,
   In love’s enchanting chase.

- CJ Dennis
