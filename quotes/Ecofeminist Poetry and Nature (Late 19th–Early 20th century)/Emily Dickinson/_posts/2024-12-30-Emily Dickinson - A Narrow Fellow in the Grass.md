A Narrow Fellow in the Grass  
Occasionally rides –  
You may see him by his notice –  
He is not at all shy –  

And for his Thought –  
He is A history  
And I just rendezvous in Summer –  
And especially for you –  

To fling out –  
Sensibility –  
From sight –  
That is respectable!  

Oh, he is ugly –  
A Tail and nothing more –  
And never can have held a How  
Only transfigured –  

But the stone free –  
And lots the dirt now –  
Oh I Spun me!  
But appearing –  


- Emily Dickinson
