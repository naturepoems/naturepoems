The Bishop Orders His Tomb at St. Praxed's Church  
...  
Then the rich clay  
Grows fruitful, breathes soft flowers,  
And brings delight, though I must decay—  
Ah, remember me with lilies;  
Something to make that cold mold warm  
And beacon me back to the charm...  

A gathering of roots,  
Roulades of summer;  
Ah, beauty, let it blossom free  
By heaven's hand, its farmer dear!

- Robert Browning
