The Man from Snowy River
There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around
That the colt from old Regret had got away,
And had joined the bold bush rangers; it was he that they called the Man from Snowy River,
Who had come to lend a hand today.

In the stormy days of the bush, where the cattle are roaming free,
The wild horse can outrun the best of men.
But that fateful race near the snowline was a test of man and stallion,
Where the skies met the rolling highland pen.

- AB Paterson Banjo Paterson
