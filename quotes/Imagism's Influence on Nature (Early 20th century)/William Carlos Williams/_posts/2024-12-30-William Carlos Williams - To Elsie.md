To Elsie
The pure
remind
themselves
of the ballads
of their youth.

The quiet,
sweet feud
of the uphill
thruway—
shining along
into those branches
of trees—

but only for an instant,
with the bliss
of the small lights
that glide
on the dusk.

The street so pale
just as rain
begins to fall,
from the dark
and the grey

about the rain,
yearning,
the rapture
to crush the light
onto watercolor—

meandering perhaps
across until I am
lost in your habitat.

Out of this
will come music!

O Love,
be satisfied.

The stove gawks
into the wet
land in the middle
of this infinite
possibly green grove.

Ah!
Light.
Your rain.

Be amazed,
my sweet Embers—

become dusts
and burns,
all My iris.

My dear,
for this tongue,
warms toward evening.

When it,
cease—

- William Carlos Williams
