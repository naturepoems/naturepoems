And I was lifted up into the sky,
With stars unfurled as thoughts made free,
Beneath where clouds wander like birds,
And waves sing back the tale of seas,
Of night’s soft moods and morning’s pace,
As rain collapses to embrace
The earth, cradled, when touched
In the beautiful chaos of life.

- Dylan Thomas
