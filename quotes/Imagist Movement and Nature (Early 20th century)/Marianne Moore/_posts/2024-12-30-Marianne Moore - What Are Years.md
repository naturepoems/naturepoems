What Are Years

What is our innocence,
    what is our guilt?
    All is vanity,
    the youth,
    the hour. 
    Assemble the nuts
and the cares,
        the flames  
    whose smoke,
    filled the air    
with shrieking light. 

The trees,
    have been  dipped in wax.
 Do  they return,
    if you seek them  
in various quarters? 

What are years,
    but their moments   
    with you,  
 
    reflections of desire  
in glass?
