Among the pines, the breezes sing low,
While twilight dowses all in silver sheen;
The leaves murmur softly, I follow their flow,
In this vast stillness where no one has been.

The twilight loves the birdsâ€™ muted call,
And I, a humble witness, stand enthralled,
With whispered prayers gathering in the hall,
Of ancient trees where every echo is recalled.

- Francis Jammes
