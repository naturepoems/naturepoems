Amidst the wild plains,
the sunflowers stretch their heads,
facing the warmth,
a sea of gold beneath the blue.
Here, I celebrate this beauty,
these blooms of laughter and light,
where each petal echoes
the joy of existence.

In their dance with the breeze,
a gentle sway, a hymn to life,
they remind me of fleeting moments,
of how love flourishes in daylight.
They share secrets of the land,
a tale told with colors,
and I stand, enchanted,
at the altar of Natureâ€™s splendor.

- Pablo Neruda
