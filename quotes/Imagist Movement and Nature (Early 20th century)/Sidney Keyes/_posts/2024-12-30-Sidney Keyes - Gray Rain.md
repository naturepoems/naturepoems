Gray Rain

Gray rain in the morning falls; 
Upon the sills the droplets rest;
Each drop is hung, a moment caught;
Each moment holds a fragment blessed.
We shall reclaim these lost hours, dear;
A symphony of the again will strike
Into the stillness of the drenched ground â€” 
While warm nature finds her way to praise;
And this gray rain shall rise again,
To drink from the floors beneath our feet,
Where the sorrows grow undisturbed,
Laughing like dew on rose petals named love.


- Sidney Keyes
