Days

Daughters of Time, the royal sisters,  
Grant the child of Earth, the joy of wonders:  
Let them come forth from the dawn  
Each bringing messages of love  
Among the quiet hum of clover,  
In the gladness of bees that traverse.  

Listen, O heart! For they call you forth,  
Daring your passion to chase after the morn;  
Pluck the hawthorn wreaths of blessings  
And rest on the hills of the dusky shade  
And find the delight you seek,  
For every day is promised rise unclouded!

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
