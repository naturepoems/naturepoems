The Evening Star

O tender light of the evening star,  
That twinkles down from realms afar;  
Thy calm embrace and serene glow,  
Dissolve the cares of day below.

Guide my thoughts to the twilight shore,  
Where dreams awaken, and spirits soar;  
Let nature's chorus sing its praise,  
To you who lights the ending days.

In your embrace, the world finds peace,  
As shadows gather, and sorrows cease;  
Forever may your brightness shine,  
O evening star, eternally thine.

- Hartley Coleridge
