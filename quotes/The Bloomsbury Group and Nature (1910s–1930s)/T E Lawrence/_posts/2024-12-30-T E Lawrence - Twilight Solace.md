In twilight's grasp, the world laid bare,
   A tranquil breeze stirs warmth and grace,
   As every sound draws one to care,
   In silence, through the sky's embrace.
   
   The stars emerge, a quiet throng,
   Each pinprick holds a distant dream,
   And moons, like silvered coins, bestow 
   A gentle light upon the stream.
   
   Here time is held within a breath,
   And life flows freely as the tide,
   In nature's arms, I find my rest,
   A solace in the evening wide.

- T E Lawrence
