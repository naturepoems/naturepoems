When autumn leaves begin to fall,
An array of orange, gold, and red.
Nature’s canvas, vibrant call,
Reminds of life’s sweet thread, once tread.

Each leaf a story, written bold,
Of seasons' change and times gone by.
In nature’s cycle, vast and old,
We find the answers in the sky.

- Marie de France
