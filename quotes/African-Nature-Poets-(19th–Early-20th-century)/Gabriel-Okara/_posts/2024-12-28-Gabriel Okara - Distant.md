Distant Horizons
Across the horizon, where the sun lays down,
And the earth meets the sky, a jeweled crown,
I long to roam those lands untamed,
Where whispers of freedom remain unclaimed.

Waves crash against the cliffs of dusk,
In the salty air, my spirit must trust,
Nature’s wildness calls my name,
To embrace its beauty, and do the same.

- Gabriel Okara
