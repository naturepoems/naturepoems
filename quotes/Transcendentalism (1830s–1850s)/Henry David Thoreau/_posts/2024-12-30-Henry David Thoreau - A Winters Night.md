A Winter's Night

It is a night of frost,
All is still,
A breath of peace,
A breath of quiet,
So silence walks,
My thoughts emerge,
Upon the stately guns,
And even then—
Drifts’d more—
Wastes of fur must fall,
By lands unbroken arms,
And yet with riches
In my wise frame—I’m here at rest.

—Henry David Thoreau
