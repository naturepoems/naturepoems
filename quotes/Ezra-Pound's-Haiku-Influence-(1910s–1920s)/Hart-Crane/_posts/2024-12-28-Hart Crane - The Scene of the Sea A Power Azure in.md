author: Hart Crane
quote: "The Scene of the Sea: A Power, Azure in the Heart of Me; 
Whose Hoarse and Gentle Rumble, Backward Cast, 
Eternal Winds Beneath The Skies, Are Made to Breathe, 
The Shivering, Sleek, Blue Wind, the Surf's Soft Whit.
As Shadows Crippled, and Gangrene Sheers it, 
The Battlements of Broad Affection, Sway, 
And Straining Beyond the Night, Yet Lift Attemptingly Why."

The Scene of the Sea: A Power, Azure in the Heart of Me; 
Whose Hoarse and Gentle Rumble, Backward Cast, 
Eternal Winds Beneath The Skies, Are Made to Breathe, 
The Shivering, Sleek, Blue Wind, the Surf's Soft Whit.
As Shadows Crippled, and Gangrene Sheers it, 
The Battlements of Broad Affection, Sway, 
And Straining Beyond the Night, Yet Lift Attemptingly Why.
