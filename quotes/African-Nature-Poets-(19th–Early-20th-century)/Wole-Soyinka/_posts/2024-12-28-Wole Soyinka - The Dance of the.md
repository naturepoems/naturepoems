The Dance of the Trees
The trees sway, in ancient dance,
To the whisper of the zephyrs’ chance,
Their boughs enraptured, high and free,
With the moonlight's soft soliloquy.

O, listen how their spirits sing,
In the warmth of twilight, they make offerings,
To the growing stars, to the midnight sun,
In the dance of shadows, under which we run.

With roots that cling to the earth’s soft skin,
In their leafy canopies, life begins.
Flourishing fables of love and fate,
Under the watchful stars they await.

Ah, feel their pulse, their steadfast grace,
In the rhythm of life, we find our place,
With every crack and creak—a call to share,
The communion of those who tread with care!

- Wole Soyinka
