The mountains stand like keepers,
watchful over the travelers that roam,
and whisper their wisdom,
as clouds adorn their peaks.

Sunrise paints the world anew,
a tableau of colors and dreams,
where peace is written on the horizon,
in the arms of the waiting trees.

In every breeze brought fresh,
a reminder that life is a journey,
with nature’s calm as our compass,
its beauty the light that leads.

- Sara Teasdale
