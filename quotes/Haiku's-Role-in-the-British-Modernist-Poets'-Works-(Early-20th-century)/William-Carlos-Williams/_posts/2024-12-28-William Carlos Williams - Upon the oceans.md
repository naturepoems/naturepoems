quote: "Upon the oceans—
                                 Buzzing sunbeams
      Releasing their grip,
Dancing on the waves,
      Under the shadow of the breeze."

Upon the oceans—
                                 Buzzing sunbeams
      Releasing their grip,
Dancing on the waves,
      Under the shadow of the breeze.

- William Carlos Williams
