The Oval

Around the oval of the lake,
there are collars of trees,
heavy with leaves.
The wind rests lonely;
a flutter of silver,
a piercing call,
a tiny boat in the fatigue...
Each can see themselves,
a reflection of summer,
falling upon shore,
scattering into fragments
a memory of time squeezed tight,
a horizon drawn close.
