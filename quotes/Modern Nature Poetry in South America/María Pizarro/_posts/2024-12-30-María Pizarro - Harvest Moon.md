Harvest Moon

Beneath the glow of autumn’s eye,
fields of gold sway in the wind,
where the air is ripe with promise,
a gathering of flavors waiting.

Corn stalks whisper secrets,
as the earth yields her bounty,
a communion between grain and sky,
a tapestry of toil and time.

At dusk, lanterns flicker to life,
a celebration of the harvest,
adorned by nature’s generous hand,
an offering of warmth to share.


- María Pizarro
