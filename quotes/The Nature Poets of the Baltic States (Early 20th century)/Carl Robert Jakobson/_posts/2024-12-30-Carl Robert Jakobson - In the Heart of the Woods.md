In the Heart of the Woods  
Walk with me down  
where the wild things grow,  
moss carpets the earth,  
a lush, vibrant show.  
Murmurs of nature  
wrapped in soft light,  
a sanctuary of solace  
in the still of the night.  
Here dance the shadows,  
the silence is loud,  
in the heart of the woods,  
where dreams are avowed.

- Carl Robert Jakobson
