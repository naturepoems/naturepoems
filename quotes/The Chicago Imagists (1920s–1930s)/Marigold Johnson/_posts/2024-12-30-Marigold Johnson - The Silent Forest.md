The Silent Forest

Deep in the woods, where shadows dwell,
A quiet calm enfolds the air,
The forest breathes a misty spell,
With secrets whispered, pure and rare.

Each rustling leaf, each creaking bough,
A testament to time’s embrace,
In nature's heart, I humbly bow,
And find my soul in this vast space.

- Marigold Johnson
