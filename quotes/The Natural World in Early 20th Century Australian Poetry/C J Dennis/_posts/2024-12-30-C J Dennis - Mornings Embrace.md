Ah! the beauty of mornings, as the dew hugs the grass,
When the freshness of nature through the stillness will pass,
And the call of the lark fills the air with a tune,
In the soft tender light of the sweet coming noon.

The cuckoo sings sweetly from a hidden retreat,
While the flowers unfold, with their glories complete;
All the world is a marvel, a verse to exclaim,
As the heart speaks in whispers, and natureâ€™s the name.


- C J Dennis
