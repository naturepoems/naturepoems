The Shepherd's Calendar

January, with whitening frost,
Has sleep upon the trees;
And birds that loved the woods in summer
Are birds of absent leaves.

In quiet glades, the stillness breathes
Among the mellow phlox;
While in the rushy dales beneath,
Are signs of hidden brooks.

As winter winds blow wild and loud,
And tremble oâ€™er the land,
Yielding their shrill, chilling sound
To give the year command.

- John Clare
