In the Forest

In the forest, lonely and still,
    Where the light streams softly through,
The whispers breathe by each wandering rill,
    And the trees glow fresh with dew.
There beauty lies in a world of green,
    And the heart beats with delight,
Amid the ferns a tranquil sheen,
    Wrapped in the hush of night.
