As day breaks bright on hills of green,
I watch the light ripple and weave,
Creating shadows, long and lean,
Where nature sings us a soft reprieve.
The world awakes with breathless grace,
Each creature flutters, moves in tune,
The sun casts paths in every space,
To cradle the dreams beneath the moon.

- Amy Lowell
