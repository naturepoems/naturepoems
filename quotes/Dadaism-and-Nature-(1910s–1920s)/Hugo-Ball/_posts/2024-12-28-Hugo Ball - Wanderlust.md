Wanderlust

The rustling child’s song,
As grasses nod to the breeze,
Unfurling each footstep,
Adventurers born of earth,
A horizon draped in secrets,
Nature’s canvas stretching wide.

With every leaf that dances,
Seasons paint their stories,
Splashing whispers upon the ground,
The air thick with possibility,
Our hearts beat in sync with the earth,
In search of the essence of being.


- Hugo Ball
