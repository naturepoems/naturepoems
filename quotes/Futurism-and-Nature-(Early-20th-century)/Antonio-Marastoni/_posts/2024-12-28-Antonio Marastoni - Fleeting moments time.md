Fleeting moments, time entwined,
Where moments breathe, and shadows play,
In nature's heart, we seek, we find,
A solace in the light of day.

Amidst the chaos of this race,
Let us return to roots of old,
Where time stands still, and nature's grace,
Whispers tales of life untold.

- Antonio Marastoni
