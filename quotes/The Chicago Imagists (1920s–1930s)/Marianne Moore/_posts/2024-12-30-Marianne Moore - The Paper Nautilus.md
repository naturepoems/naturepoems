The Paper Nautilus
Like a wizard of science-
        spinning the wings,
        the wings of a sparrow—the great
        shock of the bird,
        the extension of an imagination—you
        must face the tissue of waste
        that was left behind.

Frictionless, an entertaining stretch
        of sky that swells noon,
        the pliant waters with frost upon
        the backs of the boats,
        gathering to hold the belly,
        flowerless and sheeted, the nautilus,
        both by the sun and by deep sea.

- Marianne Moore
