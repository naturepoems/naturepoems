I found the frail, 
Unspun light of dawn, 
The irony of shadows,
Upon the murmuring face —
I let the sunlight sweep 
Calling me in by the still, 
Idling stream.
The sun breaks, 
A warmth suffuses
My wild threads of thoughts, 
Scattering petals,
Over the thistles,
The birds—hungry, sparrows,
Glinting cheerful,
In verdant stirrings.
I drink of these brief moments—
Between shriveled sighs, 
The sibilant murmurs,
A visceral hush, 
Of swirling life, 
Entangled in golden lace—
Come and let your vivid spirit
Breathe forth, even upon the barren ground.
Let us pillow ourselves within
This earth-shaking clarity—
The waking beauty unfolds, 
In trembling arcs—you are 
All things wrought, holding in!

- Hilda Doolittle
