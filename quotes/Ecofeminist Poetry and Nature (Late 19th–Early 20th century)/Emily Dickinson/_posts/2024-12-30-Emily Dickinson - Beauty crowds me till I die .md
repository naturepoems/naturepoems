Beauty crowds me till I die –  
Beauty, mercy to the eye,  
Countless Architecture, and Art,  
And dazzling shapes and colors thrust,  

Sense, a watered heart to me,  
Crops of Fruit and Health and Harmony –  
And waves to touch this yearning breast,  
Of flowing breadth and endless depth,  

Above all engaged – Wild Ferns,  
These statues of another realm  
Pure Forest Fairies peering out  
From Bird secure –  

And looks of dazzling distances –  
Beauty is the End of the quest  
And Adam’s budding Paradise  
Shall grow – forever.  


- Emily Dickinson
