The Sole
The Sole is an artist,
        painting on its duality,
        deftly showing this landscape across
        the great list of fish above,
        all a mirror as beauty at night.

From inside its shiver thought it keeps,
        roadways lure crisply formed tails flies,
        capturing what it eats: elderly; strumming
        of a new style of respect and teeter agony—

Behind that gourmet place of turning gold,
        strange angels so keenly move
        just under, despite indifference.
        Radiant home to visions vast
        in this terrestrial climax—each twinkling star
        echoes childlike laughter at low currents, brightening you! 

The sun-crossing almost heals velocity
        wherein fish in boisterous roaring leave a stretch,
        yet I wouldn’t wish you ugly outcome;
        all radiant one, you could be free.

If you remain fuses of soft thoughts
        with unselfish questions, sweet understanding,
        polite humility bears seafaring, as you?

- Marianne Moore
