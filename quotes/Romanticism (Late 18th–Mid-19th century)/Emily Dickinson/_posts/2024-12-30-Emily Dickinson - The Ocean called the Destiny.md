The Ocean called, the Destiny  
To enter there, and soon –  
What sea could ever venture  
In merry silky Moons –  

Deep did my heart assuage,  
Ere the clear waters blue –  
Fell there upon the Smoothest,  
Where the waves of Hopes renew –  

For Ocean sends its own refrain  
To every Heart – that sings –  
And drowns our little sorrows  
In where the Vessel swings –  

Then why should mortal claim to wear  
The Hint of toil’s despair -  
When every white should lean alone  
As Nature weighs – it Flare – 

On every Theme from Thralldom speak,  
And every drop can swing!  
But who that dreamed of Glory’s Roads  
Shall sink – upon the Ring!

- Emily Dickinson
