In Blackwater Woods

Look, the trees  
     are turning their own bodies  
     into pillars of light,  
     are giving off their golden leaves  
     like creatures  
     that are letting go of sadness,  
     feeling the change,  
     and the birds  
     fly high in the sky,  
     the sound of the wind  
     dances, skipping over  
     the pools of water.  
     Rest, reflectâ€”  
     this is the moment  
     to let go.  
     It is all a turning,  
     and the shadows glide  
     across the smooth ground.  
     Don't mourn  
     what has departed.

- Mary Oliver
