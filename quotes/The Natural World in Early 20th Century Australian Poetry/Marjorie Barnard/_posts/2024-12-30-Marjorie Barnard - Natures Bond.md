Through thickets dense and hills that climb,
The heart of nature beats so clear,
In every footstep lies a rhyme,
A testament to all we hold dear.

With every breath, the world unfolds,
In whispers shared and wonders sought;
For in the wild, our spirit molds,
A bond with nature deeply wrought.

- Marjorie Barnard
