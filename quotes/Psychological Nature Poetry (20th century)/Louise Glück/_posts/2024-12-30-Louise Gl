Spring

The fresh break of dawn rises,
Tantalizing the earth with color.
Something stirs beneath the earth,
a gentle memory speaking again.

Violet stands drenched,
each leaf uncreased, fresh,
every line brings back hope.
An awakening stormaround us—for spring
seems to actively stretch,
yet cloaked in furious music.

In every corner you hear the sound,
a thumping beats of wonder,
a gentle pulse resonating within.

And remember, for solitude
takes on color, shade fills
your senses as flowers girl.
When the spring arrives,
even the hardest of hearts bloom
into shapes, and beauty overflows.

— Louise Glück
