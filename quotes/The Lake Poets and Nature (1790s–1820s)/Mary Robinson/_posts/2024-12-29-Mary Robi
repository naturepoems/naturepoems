Oh, would that I could be a bird,
To soar above the earth's embrace,
To spin among the leaves unheard,
And linger long in sun's warm grace.

With every wind that bends the bough,
I'd dance upon the fragrant air,
A spirit wild, a joyous vow,
To treasure life without a care.

Beneath the skies, I’d weave my song,
In murmurs soft of summer's serenade;
For every moment learned belonged,
To Nature's heart—a sweet cascade.

- Mary Robinson
