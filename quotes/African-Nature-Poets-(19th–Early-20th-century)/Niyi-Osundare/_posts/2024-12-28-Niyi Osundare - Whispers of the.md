Whispers of the Wind

There’s a voice in the wind,
Soft as a lover’s touch,
Gentle as a willow’s sway,
It carries tales of far-off lands,
Of mountains that kiss the sky,
And rivers that sing of freedom.

I stand here, rooted,
Like the oldest oak,
Listening intently,
As the wind weaves through my leaves,
Tickling my branches.
Every gust a brushstroke
On the canvas of my heart.

Let it carry my song,
My love for the sunlit hills,
For the distant horizons,
For the rain-soaked dice of soil,
Where life bursts forth
In jubilant colors,
An orchestra of blooming joy.

- Niyi Osundare
