Spring

O Thou who passest thro’ our vallies in  
Thy Chariot of the Sun,  
Crown’d with the sickle and the corn,  
And the wildflower hast thou won.

Let the shepherd rejoice  
And let the river run;  
Let the valley and the ocean  
Chant like a hymn.

To thee we sing  
And we welcome  
The summer’s passing  
With the song of joy.


- William Blake
