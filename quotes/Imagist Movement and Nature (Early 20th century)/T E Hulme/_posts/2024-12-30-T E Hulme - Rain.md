Rain

The rain,  
Green hooped in the Gram,  
Fallen into soft holes,
Spots glittering up,  
The trees shake,
Green eyes that blink,
Rubber skins that drink.

And I am blended in,
My roots are here,  
Among the rushes.
The hot wind weaves,
Leaf falls,
Soft patches formed over,
A light on the shore  
That brings back night's moist tire.

So sweet is the earth,
In a silent whispering
Which warms to a circle of forests,
And the shade turns dusk,
Till silence ebbs more
Into the leave of the sun.

- T E Hulme
