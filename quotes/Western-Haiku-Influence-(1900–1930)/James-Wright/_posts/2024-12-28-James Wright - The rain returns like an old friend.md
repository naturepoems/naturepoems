quote: "The rain returns like an old friend, 
Softly touching each petal and leaf, 
In this fragrant air, I recall your laughter, 
The gentle rhythm of our days unspooling, 
Here in the woods we find ourselves once more."

The rain returns like an old friend, 
Softly touching each petal and leaf, 
In this fragrant air, I recall your laughter, 
The gentle rhythm of our days unspooling, 
Here in the woods we find ourselves once more.
