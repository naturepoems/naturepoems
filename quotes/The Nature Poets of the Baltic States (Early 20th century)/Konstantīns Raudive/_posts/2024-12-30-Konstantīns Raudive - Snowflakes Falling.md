Snowflakes Falling

With delicate grace,
The snowflakes fall,
Soft as whispered promises,
Blanketing the earth,
In purest white.

Each flake a story,
Unique in its form,
Tales of winter magic,
Cascading from the heavens,
Carrying wonders untold.

Silence wraps the world,
In this frosty embrace,
As I tread on the crisp ground,
Listening to the heartbeat of winter,
In the stillness of the night.

- Konstantīns Raudive
