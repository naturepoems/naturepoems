In their fine white chambers,
  Each blossom unfolds its beauty,
  A gentle rapture, rising,
  Captured in the moment's joyâ€”
  Each petal, a breath of spring,
  Speaks of tender days ahead
  Where shadows of frost fade,
  And I hear the bee's soft grace
  As it visits each hidden heart.

- Sylvia Plath
