A Hymn to God the Father

Wilt thou forgive that sin where I begun,
Which was my sin, though it were done before?
Wilt thou forgive those sins through which I run,
And do run still, though still I do deplore?

When thou hast done, thou hast not done, for I
Have an end in me, which no one sees,
For no Redeemer blest, and lonely I
Dare not divert. O sweet our modern sense, are these.

What a lovely spring! I touch the dew-filled ground.
Each toneless orb brings light of hornéd green;—
And countless ochre, splendour, glimmered, found.
Where art thou now? Can I sense the divine sheen?

For every time I breathe, I long for thee,
Yet know not all your answers love require.
Let peace anoint my soul, and let me see
All the respites connived as those I aspire.

O Mother, bless my heart with living clay,
Where by your hand with Nature I broke free,
And here we can spread blankets and let the dew lay,
To draw forth from lands what's rooted in Nature's glee!

- John Donne
