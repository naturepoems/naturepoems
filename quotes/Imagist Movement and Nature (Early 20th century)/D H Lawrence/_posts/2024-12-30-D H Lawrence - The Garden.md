The Garden

   Whispering winds float over the gardens,
   everywhere, fresh fragrance, the delight of space,
   amidst the creeping vines and savers soft,
   springs boiling through even where sun lingers,
   drawing joy across the painted tombs.
   In the hum of honey-bees laced, life pulses boundless.


- D H Lawrence
