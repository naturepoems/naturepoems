MOUNTAIN SONG  
Oh mountains, stand proud  
Against the blue.  
You’ve watched over the rivers  
And the life that springs forth,  
In this sacred space.  

Your ancient stones bear witness  
To dreams and battles fought,  
In whispers of every child,  
That ran down your slopes,  
In search of love and laughter.  

What secrets do you keep?  
In the shadows of your heights,  
And the winds that howl,  
When storms arise from sleep?  


- Bessie Head
