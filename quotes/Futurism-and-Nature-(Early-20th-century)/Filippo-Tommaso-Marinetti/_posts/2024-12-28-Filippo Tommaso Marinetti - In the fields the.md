In the fields, the flowers
    vibrate like electric sparks,
    in a cacophony of colors,
    screaming their existence
    to the heavens above.

I embrace their wildness,
    the rapture of the earthâ€™s heartbeat,
    aflame with the intoxicating scent
    that rises, like ambition, unbridled.

- Filippo Tommaso Marinetti
