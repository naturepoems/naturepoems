A river meanders, soft and slow,
Its tranquil path, a gentle flow;
Mirroring skies, beneath the trees,
It carries secrets, and the breeze.

Frogs croak softly, crickets sing,
In perfect harmony, nature's ring;
In quiet moments, silence speaks,
The language of the earth that seeks.

- Vladimir Solovyov
