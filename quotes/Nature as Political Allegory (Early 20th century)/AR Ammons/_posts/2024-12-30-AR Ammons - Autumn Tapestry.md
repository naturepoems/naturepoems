The woods are ablaze, an ardent dance,
colors clashing like ideas in the air,
Lazily, leaves fall, a surrender to
this fermentation of life’s totality,

where insects crawl and roots incline
to drink the best of rains.
There’s a wild rhythm here,
insisting that life’s tune is always changing,
age after age.
