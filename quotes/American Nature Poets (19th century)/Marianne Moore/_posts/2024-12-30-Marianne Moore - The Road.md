The Road

The road stretches ahead, concrete and alive,
With whispers of the rustling leaves,
A winding path, flanked by wildflowers,
The hum of bees and sun-kissed grass,
Each step a dance sung softly to nature,
In echoing sounds of thoughtful footsteps,
Where the heart meets the soul of the earth.

- Marianne Moore
