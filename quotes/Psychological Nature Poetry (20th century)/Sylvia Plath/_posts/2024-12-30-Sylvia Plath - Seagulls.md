Seagulls wheeling high above,
  My heart’s dependent on such birds,
  Lost in the vastness of the ocean,
  Rolling waves, a dance uncommanded,
  Yet I exist where wild things dwell.
  Each storm lifts the salt of my tears,
  Each breeze carries the echo
  Of laughter that never dies—
  I am here, always here.

- Sylvia Plath
