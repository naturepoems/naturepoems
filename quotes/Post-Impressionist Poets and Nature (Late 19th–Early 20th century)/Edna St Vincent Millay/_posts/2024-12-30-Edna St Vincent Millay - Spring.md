Spring

To what purpose, April, do you return again?
Beauty is not enough. Like truth, I am
The worth that I cannot prove a sin.

The crawling buds, the robin’s call
Insist on eager gathering in
Into slow turns the lives of men.
Why, out of the dark I hear the trees
Pleased cooing in the sunlit field

And the heavy scent of a change: is it spring?
Pencil prick the shade, I want to sing!  
A child at play, I cannot spare the time,
I bend to peruse
My dreams scattered
In tiny books of myself in prose.


- Edna St Vincent Millay
