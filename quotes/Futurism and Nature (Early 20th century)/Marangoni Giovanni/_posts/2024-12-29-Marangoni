The night sky twinkles, a jeweled cloak,
Stars whisper softly, tales from afar.
In the silence, the universe spoke,
An invitation to travel, to wander, to spar.
In this celestial dance, we lose our fears,
Embracing the vastness, the endless years.
For within the cosmos, we are but a spark,
Yet together we shine, igniting the dark.

- Marangoni Giovanni
