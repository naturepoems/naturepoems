The Woodpecker
  
A woodpecker yonder
Is drilling, drilling,
With a dull, dull sound
That echoes through the stillness.
— A rhythmical lace
In the woven woods,
A chase of silence,
Tripping up the soft and leaf-strewn
Mossy path of the waning day.

It makes the sky tremble
And the trees cry out
In sad, fine notes from their depths—
The sound of a discontented heart.
And from my perch,
With wondering eyes uplifted,
I glance at Nature’s toil,
Watching for the slow descent
Of the twinkling stars.

But through all the beauty—
The chill of that penetrating sound—
It fills the calm relief with thoughts
Of hopeless wanderings,
And lingering sadness beyond.  


- Thomas Wentworth Higginson
