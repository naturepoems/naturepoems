The Mountain

Majestic silhouette against the sky,
intense and resolute,
the mountain stands,
a titan of stillness,
a sentinel of time.

Covered in snow’s pristine blanket,
it holds secrets of ages,
a memory of creation’s breath,
a pulse within the stone.

Climb!—reach for the heights,
in pursuit of the infinite,
stillness within your chest,
the echo of your footsteps,
a harmony in the wild; here,
in the mountains, you find yourself.
