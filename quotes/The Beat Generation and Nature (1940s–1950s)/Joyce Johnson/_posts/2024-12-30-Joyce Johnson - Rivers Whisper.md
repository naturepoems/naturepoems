Across the valley, the river flows,
carrying whispers of old,
         shimmering sweetly
              like summer’s laughter.
It wraps around the pebbled shores,
    where sunlight kisses the water,
                    and the world sighs gently.

Beneath the surface, fish dart
              as I breathe in silence,
                       feeling the ripples,
like gentle hands touching my soul.
Here the world is still,
and the sky, oh the sky
   fills the canvas of life.

Every moment lingers
    like the fading of the songs.
Nature, a painter with strokes of grace,
        colors my dreams.

- Joyce Johnson
