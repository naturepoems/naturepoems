A soft caress, a lover’s sigh;
This sweet expanse of earth and sky,
Where moments stretch, and time deceives.
A tranquil heart finds solace here,
Under the watchful eye of stars."

The wind stirs gently through the leaves,
A soft caress, a lover’s sigh;
This sweet expanse of earth and sky,
Where moments stretch, and time deceives.
A tranquil heart finds solace here,
Under the watchful eye of stars.
