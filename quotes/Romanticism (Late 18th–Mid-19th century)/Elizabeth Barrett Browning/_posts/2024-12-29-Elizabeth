I sit in the shade of growing trees,
And brush the leaves that softly sway;
The softest song comes on the breeze,
To lift my heart, and lead my way.

Where nature whispers in my ear,
In every blossom's fragrant sight,
While moonlit dreams break sweet and clear,
I know the world is pure delight.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
