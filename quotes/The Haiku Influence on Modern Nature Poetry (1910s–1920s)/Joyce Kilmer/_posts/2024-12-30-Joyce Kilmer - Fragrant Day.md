Take, O my heart, this fragrant day  
And wrap it close in song;  
The whispers in the leaves at play,  
Breathe memories so long.  

The dew along the morning grass  
Gives life its wondrous glow;  
As air and sun and dreams, alas,  
Flow through the world below.  

Oh let me keep these visions bright  
With every heartbeat’s chord;  
In nature’s vast and loving light  
I gather to my Lord.

- Joyce Kilmer
