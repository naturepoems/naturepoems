The Woods

In the deep woods, where the trees arise,  
And the air is full of quiet sighs,  
Where the shadows dance and the wild birds sing,  
The reverence of their majesty brings.

How still the atmosphere, how rich the shade!  
The golden sunbeams pierce the glade,  
There in the stillness, I sink in thought,  
In the reverence of the beauty I sought.

The whisper of the branches calls to me,  
And the fragrance of wildflowers sets my spirit free,  
The dance of nature all around  
In the deep woods where life is found.

- Lydia Sigourney
