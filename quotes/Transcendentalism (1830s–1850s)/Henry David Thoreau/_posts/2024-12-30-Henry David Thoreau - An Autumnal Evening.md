An Autumnal Evening

The heavens reveal their glory,
And the setting sun—
Wars upon wary old age.
All were beginning, and not all were over,
We wait in silence,
For unknown discourses from beyond;
But quiet too in splendor,
Spots in place between and among the others—
    To see your peace
In wound after wound like the open earth.

—Henry David Thoreau
