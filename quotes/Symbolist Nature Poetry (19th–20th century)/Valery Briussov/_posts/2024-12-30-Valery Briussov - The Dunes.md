The Dunes

Waves of sand, where whispers roam,
The dunes, a desert’s vast embrace,
In golden hues that sing of foam,
A shifting, endless, timeless space.

Each grain a tale of sun and breeze,
Of storms that shape the shifting land,
In every crest, the memory sees,
The subtle dance, the ancient hand.

The shadows forge a silent art,
As sunlight weaves through softest strands,
In every rise, a beating heart,
The melody of life demands.

So wander here, where silence reigns,
And hear the secrets that abide,
For in these dunes, where beauty wanes,
The spirit finds a place to hide.
