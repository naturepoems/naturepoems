Love

Love bade me welcome: yet my soul drew back,  
Guilty of dust and sin.  
But quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack  
From my first entrance in,  
Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning  
If I lacked anything.  
A guest, I answered, worthy to be here:  
Love said, You shall be he.  
I, the uninvited guest, did earn your stare;  
For, being but dust, fashioned in error here  
Thou shouldst say, in darkness I was born;  
For by thy love and arms I call.



- George Herbert
