The North Wind

The boughs do break with the weight of snow,
  And the pines are bending low;
So fierce and strong is the north wind’s blow,
  A bitter, chiding foe.

But have you watched the morning sun
  O’er valleys cold and wide?
When the light glints softly, a bitter shun,
  And the earth is all aglow inside?

Ah! sweet the peace is that comes around
  From the wild and wintry air,
And the fresh scent of the woods is found
  When the heart is bold and bare!

- Isabella Valancy Crawford
