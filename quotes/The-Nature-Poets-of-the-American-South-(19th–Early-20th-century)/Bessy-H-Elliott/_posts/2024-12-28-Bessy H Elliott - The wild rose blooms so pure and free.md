The wild rose blooms, so pure and free,  
A fleeting gift from earth to see;  
It nods to bees that buzz in play,  
Then shrinks beneath the sun's hot ray.  
But while it blooms, it sings its song,  
Of beauty brief but pure and strong;  
A reminder in the passing days,  
That life, though brief, deserves our praise.

- Bessy H Elliott
