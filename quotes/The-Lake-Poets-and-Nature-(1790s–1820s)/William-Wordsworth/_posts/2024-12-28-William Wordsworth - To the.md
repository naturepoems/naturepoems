To the Cuckoo
O blessèd Bird! the voice of Spring,
Thy welcome notes from tree to tree
Are cherished by each living thing,
And echo round the sunny lea,
Thy hymn of hope, thy mate's sweet call,
Thou Prophet of the sunny places!
Sing on till a thousand echoes fall
From every bough in the wild spaces.

Thou twinkling spirit, lent to earth,
Thou heaven-born songster! let the night
Dissolve in blossoms at thy birth,
And bring to prospect scenes of light!
O thou, to whom so bright a part
In Nature's grand, illustrious story
Is given! thou, who art all heart,
And sense, and song, and ancient glory!

Thus as I listen to thy song,
With joy and tremor stirring deep,
I feel my spirit rise along
With the echo of the songs I keep.
O blessèd Bird! thy voice, divine,
Is our first glimpse of heavenly bliss!
Sing on, till every heart shall shine
With joy, beneath thy gentle kiss.

- William Wordsworth
