The Road
by W. S. Merwin

Walk where no one goes,
The river chooses its way,
Each stone, each bend in laughter confi rms.
The world unfolds, unspooling fates,
And the echoes linger like leaves
Drifting from shadow into light, 
Beside the wisdom of the trees,
Where each path whispers home.

- W S Merwin
