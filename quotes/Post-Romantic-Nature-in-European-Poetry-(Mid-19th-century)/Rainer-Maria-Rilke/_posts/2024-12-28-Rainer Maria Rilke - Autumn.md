Autumn

Ah, in the orange glow of dying
Leaves, deep in the stillness of the woods,
Where branches whisper to each other,
And loam covers the shadows,

There something calls out, something shifts,
Moving through the fading harvest air,
Stirring the essence of the golden.
What stillness, what patience lies in it.

Do the trees lament their falling?
Or do they find a certain peace
In letting go, in being bare,
In winter's coming cloaks of white?

- Rainer Maria Rilke
