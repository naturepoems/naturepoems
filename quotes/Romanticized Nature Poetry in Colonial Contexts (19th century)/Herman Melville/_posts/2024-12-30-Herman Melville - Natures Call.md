In the Far West
Where the sun is glorified,
Where the pale stars seem to weep,
Where the moon hangs like a pearl,
I wandered naked, free and wild,
A child of earth and air alone.

O winds, that serenade the strife
And the silence of the night,
Breathe on me, I plead, and bring
The echo of the unknown bliss —
The far heart of the wilderness,

That sings all night, beneath the stars.
It sings great miles to my feet,
It sings a secret power bare,
That longs for dreams awakened here.

For here, in this resplendent waste,
The heart shall start to beat anew,
And know again a boundless love,
An endless yearning — unfulfilled — 
That rings these woods and winds with joy.
