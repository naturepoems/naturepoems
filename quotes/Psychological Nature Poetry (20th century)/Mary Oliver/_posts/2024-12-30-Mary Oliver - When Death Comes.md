When Death Comes

When death comes  
like the hungry bear in autumn;  
when death comes and takes all the bright coins from his purse  
  to buy me, and to cast me aside  
like a leaf, that sings to me in its own language  
  and knows not the reason whyâ€”  
I want to step through its door in a dance of joy,  
and wait for the body of a wild creature.  
When death comes,  
I want to face it,  
to be grateful for this life,  
to be grateful for the colors seen and the seasons felt.  
When death comes, I want to feel alive until the very last moment of what I have loved.

- Mary Oliver
