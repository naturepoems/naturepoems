In the woods is perpetual youth.
Within these plantations of God, a decorum
And sanctity of manners, a balm,
As from the sky descends, due in the evening, so without
Him we would perish.  O solitude!
In that fair solitude of nature!  Depopulated precincts,
With more growth than wealth, there is peace.

When the modifiers depart, the grandeur has gone.
But when the moon has died—and the stars,
Beauty of dusk, with their own music,
Seem only like shadows—they but live.

  They seem like spirits passing silent.
How many thoughts would we forfeit, then,
For our own peace?

- Christopher Pearse Cranch
