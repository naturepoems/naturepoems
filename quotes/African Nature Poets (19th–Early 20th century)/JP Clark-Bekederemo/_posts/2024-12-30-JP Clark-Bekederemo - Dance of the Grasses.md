Beneath the arching skies,
Where the sun meets the plain,
The wild grasses dance,
Rejoicing in the rain.

The earth breathes a soft sigh,
In each petal, every blade,
As nature spins her stories,
In the fabrics that she made.

We are but small travelers,
In this vast, wondrous place,
Nature holds the secrets,
Of time and endless grace.

- JP Clark-Bekederemo
