In the quiet of the dawn,  
Where shadows wane and spirits rise,  
The world awakens soft and sweet,  
Underneath the painted skies.

Each ray of light a promise made,  
As nature breathes her morning hymn,  
And dew-kissed grass in silence sways,  
In rhythms known but lost in whim.

The heart responds to tranquil sights,  
As birds take flight in joyous bloom,  
In every moment, life ignites—  
A tapestry of peace resumes.

- Andrej Ērgļs
