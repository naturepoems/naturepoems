A coffee-cup of fine porcelain,
Half broken, (for I threw it at the wall)
I gather'd. I saw the glittering edge
Of one small bit, and thought—much like this bit,
This small reflection of myself—so slips
The world and I know her. Things slip away,
Yet out beyond are, flowers of tenderness,
And eyes which make me glad—Sun of the day.
If one small bit remembers me, 
My love will not be forsaken.
I love the face of every man,
The grass, the wind, the clouds; 
I love the trees and shadows on the ground.

I stand upon a precipice of thought—
Far down is Nature, cradled in her arms,

Beaming light about; then I will step,
And while my foot takes heed to grasp the soil,
Feel the rhythm of embers and earth,
Of heart, of man, of roots which run deep down.
I love that quiet hour when night descends,
When slowly breath is drawn, the world exhales,
Only to wake in dawn’s gentler embrace.

O how I love, dear Nature's endless song!

- Dora Carrington
