The Coming of Spring

When the frost is gone from the ground,
And the sun begins to bring its warm light,
We hear the call of the robin’s sweet round,
And the world starts to wake up from the night.

The trees burst forth with their buds so green,
And the flowers start peeping above the earth,
It’s a glorious sight to see what has been,
As nature once more gives the gift of her birth.

The brook gurgles happily to its bed,
While the bees buzz busily in search of their food,
And the skies are filled with a cheerful spread,
Of colors and fragrances, all things renewed.

- John Burroughs
