The roses are red, the roses are yellow,
The violets are blue and the sea is a-fellow,
For the stars are all eyes, and the mountains all ears,
And the trees wear their crowns like patricians of years.

A heart that is brave with a tryst with the wild,
And the world leaps to greet us, a passionate child.
The grasses are whispering secrets of dawn,
And the song of the sea birds, of skyward, are drawn.


- C J Dennis
