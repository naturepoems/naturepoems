The Idea of Order at Key West

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind of man.
The fishing boats graze on the curve of the bay.

Wider than waters, the sea changes all our senses.
In the keys, she sings as if by design,
To wave and billow without a proof to keep.

I thought of touch—this splendor that is the main—you
Like a lighthouse and with the flesh of the stars,
Become the water crashing breaking on the shores,

What the word must mean where it reaches blackout
In the unending height of evening; splendor runs
Away, while, upon the blue, her deep notes call.

All are singing the same; some must think
To capture the ocean, those young voices her own:
And through the silence, I hear her lost soliloquy,

Speaking of the harmony of creation, it’s gone—
For now I know it’s lost within the echoes
Of the waves blending together as she calls out, free.

There is the measure of her voice this night,
All are still as though caught in wonder,
I feel her whisper from the forest dark.



- Wallace Stevens
