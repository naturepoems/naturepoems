What my lips have kissed, and where, and why

What my lips have kissed, and where, and why,
I have forgotten, and what arms have lain,
Under my head till morning; but the rain
Is full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh

Upon the glass and listen for reply,
And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain,
For unremembered, late, I leave the lane
And watch the clouds drift over the sky.

If I knew in my heart that love is a dream,
And kissed at dawn the faces of a thousand
Ties another night back together into the green.

Hushed the trick-leaf wind bears witness of
Deepest life forgotten in nature, I am one
Of those souls lost to this earth, this home.

By where the ghosts of flowers still bloom.


- Edna St Vincent Millay
