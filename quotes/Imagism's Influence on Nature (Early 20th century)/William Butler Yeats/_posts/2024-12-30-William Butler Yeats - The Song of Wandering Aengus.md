The Song of Wandering Aengus
I went out to the hazel wood,
Because a fire was in my head,
And I cut and peeled a willow wand,
And I dating the berries red,
And I flung my berries in the air
And danced around in heated flare.

In the glades with the greenish tree,
With a whisper of the wind I dreamed an opening fair,
But it made me more alone, and dressed the night with love,
And count of stars when silence held and called me free.

And when I went out, I saw a glimmering light
It was hope that whispered, under the cool of the night.
And so it is that I go onward, you have delayed my life,
Oh, Aengus come closer with your enchanted air.

- William Butler Yeats
