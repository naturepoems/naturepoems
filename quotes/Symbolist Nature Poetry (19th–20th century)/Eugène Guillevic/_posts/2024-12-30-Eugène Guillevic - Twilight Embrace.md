In the solitary embrace
   of the twilight trees,
   the flickering leaves engulf,
   holding secrets to the roots
   where silence thickens,
   cradling grace beneath.
 
The night hums with wonders,
   a chorus of stars and winds,
  as the moon casts its gaze,
   pooling light upon the waves,
   where dreams flow gently,
   splintering into reflections.

With awe, we listen,
   the language of the earth,
   that murmurs softness,
   around the pulse of dusk,
   weaving life into shadows.
 
In this clarification,
   within nature's arms,
   we belong,
   unbroken, at last.

- Eugène Guillevic
