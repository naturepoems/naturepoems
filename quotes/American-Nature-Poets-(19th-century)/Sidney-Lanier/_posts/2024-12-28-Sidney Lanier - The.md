The Hurricane

By Sidney Lanier

I
How the hurricane springs, like a skilled musician,
      With a roar that is grand and immense,
Through the forest it sweeps, in a keenly-spun mission,
      Shaking branches and leaves from their sense.

II
Now the trees howl and bow, yet stand firm in their place,
      And the birds soar above in their strange, sharp flight,
Every echo would ring through the murmuring face,
      When the winds rise and fall in their bright, wild plight.

- Sidney Lanier
