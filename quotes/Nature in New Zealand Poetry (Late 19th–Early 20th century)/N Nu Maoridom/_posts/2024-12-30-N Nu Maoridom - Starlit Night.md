Starlit Night

Beneath the vault of midnight's glow,
Where stardust weaves a tale of woe,
The universe in silence sprawls,
In every twinkle, wonder calls.

The cosmic dance, an ageless rite,
In solitude, I find my light,
In shadows cast by moon's embrace,
I trace the paths of endless grace.

- N Nu Maoridom
