River’s Embrace

The river flows, a silver thread,
Through meadows wide and hills aglow,
It dances past the willow’s head,
Where secrets in its waters flow.

Upon its banks, the wildflowers sway,
A palette bright, a vibrant scene,
In nature’s arms, I long to stay,
As time drifts softly, like a dream.
