Winter’s Breath

The mountain stands in stillness,
a breath of frost clinging tight,
yet beneath the blanket of white,
dauntless green stirs in slumber.

Snowflakes quilt the pines,
a delicate lace of nature,
glistening silver under night skies,
a soft glow on a silent eve.

In each exhale, warmth rises,
reviving what the cold has masked,
as spring’s promise lingers near,
one heartbeat away from dawn's light.


- María Pizarro
