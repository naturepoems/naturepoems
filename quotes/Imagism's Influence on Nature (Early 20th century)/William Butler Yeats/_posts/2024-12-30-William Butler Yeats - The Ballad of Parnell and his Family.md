The Ballad of Parnell and his Family
And so the way of the soft summer's day,
Where wildflowers blushing in the gentle sway,
Under sunlight burn with a beautiful plight,
And you hear the call of the bird in the night.

The valleys are rich with your tragedy still,
As I walk through the shadows that you fulfill,
Yet like the flowers in the meadow's green breast,
The song of your name shall always be blessed.

- William Butler Yeats
