The Light of Nature
When Nature is in pain, the heart of man
Is but the reflection of her anguish; and
What horror comes to him can be nothing less
Than what she suffers! Pain and grief are one.

A worm is drifting in the pool of light,
And the tall weeds are leaning down to drink
The shadow of a blazing star while faintly
The dew drops tremble on the silver grass.
    
And all the trees throw off their fair disguise,
And stand with naked trunks and arms in air
Stripped bare of their fine foliage and flowers;
Yet something shines upon their offerings divine.


- James Russell Lowell
