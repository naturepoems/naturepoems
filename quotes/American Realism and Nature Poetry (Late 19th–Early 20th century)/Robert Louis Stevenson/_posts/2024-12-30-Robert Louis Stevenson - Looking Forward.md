Looking Forward
The sun is shining golden bright,  
       The flowers bloom in every hue;  
A thousand dreams await my sight  
       Beneath this sky of endless blue.

The meadow sings a sweet, sweet song,  
       While brooks and rivers weave and twine;  
My heart yearns, for the world is strong,  
       With wonders waiting, all divine.

So I shall walk and thus behold  
       The miracles that nature weaves;  
With every step, my heart grows bold,  
       In expectancy, the mind believes.




- Robert Louis Stevenson
