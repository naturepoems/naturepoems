I must go down to the seas again,  
To the lonely sea and the sky,  
And all I ask is a tall ship and a star  
To steer her by;  
And the wheels kick and the wind's song  
And the heart and the winds and the foam,  
And the empty night,  
The grace of the flower,  
And the willows sway in the storm.

And all I ask is a tall ship and a star  
To steer her by.

- John Masefield
