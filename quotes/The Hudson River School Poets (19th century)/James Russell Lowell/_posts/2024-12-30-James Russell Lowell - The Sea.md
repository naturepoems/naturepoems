The Sea
  
O mighty, rolling sea,
Thy depths, a mystic blue;
Aloud with frothy laughter,
Forever young and true.

Those waves, like happy spirits,
Make music on the shore,
With all their hoary whiteness,
Swelling evermore.

And I, a humble traveler,
Pausing in my tide,
Feel thy cool breath about me,
As thou art ever wide.

- James Russell Lowell
