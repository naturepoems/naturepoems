A violet by a mossy stone
Half-hidden from the eye!
Fair, as a star, when only one
Is shining in the sky!

She stands alone, and sweetly born
Where softest winds do sigh,
I scarcely knew it, but by morn
I felt her quiet nigh.

So small but proud, as one could conjure,
With dewdrops, bright and clear,
No grandeur speaks; so sweet my flower,
A fleeting lady dear.

- William Wordsworth
