The moonlight casts a silver sheen,
Over fields of green where we once dreamed.
The nightingale sings beneath the stars,
A lullaby sweet, healing our scars.

Nature holds us in her embrace,
A sanctuary of quiet grace.
In every shadow, in every light,
The beauty of life shines ever bright.

- Clive Bell
