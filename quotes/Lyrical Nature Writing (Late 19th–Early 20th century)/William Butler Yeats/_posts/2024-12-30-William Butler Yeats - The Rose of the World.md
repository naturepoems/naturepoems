The Rose of the World
O Dublin, sing thee love's delight,
Whom the fountain, maid, has caught,
And the godly Classic light
Is in the glimmer of her thought;

O, stand still, my soul, and know:
She's fairer than the fallen snow
And choose who best can learn to sing
Upon the darkened trees of spring.

- William Butler Yeats
