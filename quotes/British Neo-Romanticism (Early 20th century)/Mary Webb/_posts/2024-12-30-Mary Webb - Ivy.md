Ivy

The ivy clings to the crumbling stone,
With fingers green and resolute will,
In every crevice, it finds a home,
In resolution the heart can fulfill.

It climbs with vigor, it sprawls with grace,
An emblem of strength against the weight,
While offering beauty in every place,
It conquers sorrow, it conquers fate.

In tangled growth, there is a tale,
Of resilience poised in the heart of earth,
As ivy whispers through every gale,
A testament to nature's rebirth.


- Mary Webb
