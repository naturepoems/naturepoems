Song for a Dark Girl
Way Down South in Dixie
beyond the art,

We lived together
under the moon.
We were warm in the night
but you did not leave.

Your heart fluttered
like a rose in the evening
and I did not know
it could be so cruel.

Brought to a noise,
a road by the sound,
In so many ways
without sound there is chaos.

Shimmering, shining,
I walked through the night and clouds,
while you sang to me.

So tell me, tell me,
why did love run away?
The golddust thrall
that spears through the stars.
_Love is only life?_

- Langston Hughes
