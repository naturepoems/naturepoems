The sun shines brightly on the hill,
The trees stand tall, their branches sway,
The brook runs gently, and all is still,
In the soft light of the glowing day.

A thousand voices sing and play,
In harmony with Nature’s breath;
The flowers bloom, a bright array,
Reminding us of life and death.

For beauty here does ever dwell,
In each green leaf, in every hue,
And in the heart it casts a spell,
Of joy that life brings forth anew.

- George Gordon Byron
