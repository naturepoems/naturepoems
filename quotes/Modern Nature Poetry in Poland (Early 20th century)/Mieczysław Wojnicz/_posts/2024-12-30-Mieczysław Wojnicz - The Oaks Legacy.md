The Oak's Legacy
The ancient oak stands tall and wise,
With branches reaching for the skies,
In every ring, a story lies,
Of storms endured and summer’s sighs.

Its leaves like hands embrace the breeze,
A shelter for the restless bees,
Within its shade, generations bore,
The cycle of life forevermore.

- Mieczysław Wojnicz
