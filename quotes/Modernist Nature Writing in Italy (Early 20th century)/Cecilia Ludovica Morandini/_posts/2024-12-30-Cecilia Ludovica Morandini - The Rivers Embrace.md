The River's Embrace

Winding gracefully,
the river spills like laughter,
a mirror for the sky,
reflecting dreams and fleeting moments.
Its current, an endless pulse,
a heart that beats within the land,
carving stories into the banks,
witness to every joy and sorrow.

Beneath the surface lies
an unseen world,
a dance of life in liquid motion,
where fish glide like shadows,
turtles bask in the sun,
each ripple a whisper
of nature's gentle caress.

- Cecilia Ludovica Morandini
