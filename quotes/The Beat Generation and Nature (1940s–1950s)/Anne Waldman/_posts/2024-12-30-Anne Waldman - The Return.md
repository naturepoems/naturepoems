The Return
the earth spins back,
a rhythm that calls us down,
dug from the soil, each step sings
of life descending like leaves,
ature whispers in each motion,
a fragrance that brings memories.

the back woods, the laughter of children,
every shadow resting among pines,
ancestors returning with the rain,
wrapping choice and obligation,
a path embracing what was lost,and the roots growing beyond.

Anne Waldman
