The shadows snarl,
tugging at the edges
of this moment,
but the flower stands,
resilient in the heart
of the forest,
do scattered petals
carry the weight of silence?

The sky is a hymn
of blue and cloud,
a soft embrace
against the anger of sun,
that makes each leaf
sparkle in its light.

- Cecilia Vicuña
