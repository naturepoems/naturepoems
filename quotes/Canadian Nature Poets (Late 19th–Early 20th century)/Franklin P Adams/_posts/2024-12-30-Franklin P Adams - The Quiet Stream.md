The Quiet Stream

A stream flows gently, whispering low,
Through meadows bright where wildflowers grow,
It sings a song both sweet and clear,
A melody for all to hear.

In every bend, it finds its way,
Reflecting sunbeams, night, and day,
A sacred path through earth’s embrace,
In nature’s stillness, we find grace.


- Franklin P Adams
