The Light and the Dark
  
  The light that spills upon the ground  
  Is like a child, with joy unbound,  
  The dark comes softly, like a breath,  
  Embracing dreams, and whispering death.

  Nature dances in her time,  
  A cycle spun so full, so prime,  
  We walk between the two, and find  
  A rhythm bound, a fate entwined.

- Louis MacNeice
