THE WOOD WOOING

The woods are now in their summer sigh
And the breeze has had its burnish close,  
As I wander in the shadowy vale,  
Where cool green shadows back and forth  
Beneath the whispering leaf they trail.  

A sudden bird-call, quick as thought,  
Takes the angel shape of a gleam on high;  
And the frail branches, lilac-blown,  
With their stir of pearls put on the rose,  
Will tremble softly, sweet with sigh.

White clouds like lily-pads drift above  
On the waters of the deep blue sky;  
And beneath the flow’rs of the open wood  
The summer seems at her will to play,  
With half-closed lids she burns my cheek.

I feel the shaking sun upon my brow  
And the warm night has made her way;  
But the other winds where I awake  
With younger hearts and sighing cries  
Have magian eyes that kindle joy.

O woods, you’re a sanctuary white,  
And I tread no longer meek along the way,  
But stand in worship at your altar laid  
With flowers of beauty, filled with love—  
O woods! from the heights of the day.
