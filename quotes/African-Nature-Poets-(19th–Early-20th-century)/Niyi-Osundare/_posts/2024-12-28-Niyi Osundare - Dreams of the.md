Dreams of the Forest

In the heart of the forest,
Where sunlight kisses the leaves,
Laughter mingles with silence,
And every rustle is a whisper,
I dream of places untouched,
Of ancient pact kept with the earth.

Tall sentinels, the trees
Guard our secrets,
Every ring a year,
Every branch a memory.
Ferns sway like soft thoughts,
While wildflowers declare,
Their colors burst forth,
Charming the air with sweet laughter.

Let me wander deeper,
Into your embrace,
Where shadows play hide and seek,
Where the air dances with birdsong,
And the spirit of the wild flows,
Endless as the sky above,
Infused with nature’s grace.
