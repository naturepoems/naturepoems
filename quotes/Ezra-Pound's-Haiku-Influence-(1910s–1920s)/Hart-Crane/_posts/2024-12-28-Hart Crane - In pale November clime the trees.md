author: Hart Crane
quote: "In pale November clime, the trees, 
Resist like velvet shrouds,
Midst chatter on the breeze, 
And all the skies enshrouded,
Rich are moments caught in scenes,  
The Lady’ s gaze untouched by inward clouds."

In pale November clime, the trees, 
Resist like velvet shrouds,
Midst chatter on the breeze, 
And all the skies enshrouded,
Rich are moments caught in scenes,  
The Lady’ s gaze untouched by inward clouds.

- Hart Crane
