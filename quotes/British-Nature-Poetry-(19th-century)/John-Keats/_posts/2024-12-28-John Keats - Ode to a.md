Ode to a Nightingale:

My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
   My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
   One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
   But being too happy in thine happiness—
That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees
   In some melodious plot
   Of beechen green, and shadowsNumberless,
   Singest of summer in full-throated ease.

O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been
   Cool'd a long age in the deep-delayed sun,
   When I was young! and held the form of beauty
In youth, and all the world’s joy was in me.

- John Keats
