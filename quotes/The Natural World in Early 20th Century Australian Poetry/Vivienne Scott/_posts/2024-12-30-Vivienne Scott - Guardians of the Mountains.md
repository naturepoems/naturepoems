The mountains stand like sentinels bold,  
Guardians of stories yet untold,  
In their shadows, dreams take flight,  
Chasing whispers in the night.

Crimson sun on rugged face,  
Draws forth a tranquil, sacred space,  
Where solitude and longing blend,  
In the arms of the hills, we mend.


- Vivienne Scott
