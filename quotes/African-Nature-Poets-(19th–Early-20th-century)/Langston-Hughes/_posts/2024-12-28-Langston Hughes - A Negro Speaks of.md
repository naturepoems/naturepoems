A Negro Speaks of Rivers

I've known rivers:
Ancient, dusky rivers.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

The land that shapes my days,
The sky that holds my dreams,
All bend and flow beneath the moon.

The sun warms my skin,
And the rivers sing to me.
I have known their depths,
And in them found my voice.

- Langston Hughes
