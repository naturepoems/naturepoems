Oh, the trees are alive with the hum of the bees,
And the blooms are aglow with the light of the skies.
Nature's canvas is painted in hues of delight,
As the day fades to rest and the stars gleam in sight.

Hear the soft whisper of leaves in the breeze,
The rustle of grasses where a rabbit may seize,
Moments of silence, where thoughts can unwind,
Gifted by nature, so wondrous and kind.

- Jean Blewett
