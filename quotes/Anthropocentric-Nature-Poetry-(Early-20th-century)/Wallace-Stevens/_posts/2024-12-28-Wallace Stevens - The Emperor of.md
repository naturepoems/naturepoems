The Emperor of Ice-Cream

Call the roller of big cigars,
The muscular man, and bid him whip
Up a wonder in this earth.

The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.
Let be be finale of seem.
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.

Take from the dresser of deal,
Lacking the three glass knobs, that sheet
On which she embroidered in white,

The flowered confections, that are
Each at their own end complete;
And let the framing now begin.

So softly a progress does come
Of those waiting in a kind of feast,
Instead of flowers and leaves combining,

There is the winter darkness winging in,
Where winter tends to where itâ€™s been The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.



- Wallace Stevens
