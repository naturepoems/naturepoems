Stanzas for Music  

There is a joy sublime, that moves
Through woods and amidst the dunes,
And oceans tell their tales of love,
So I do not my being spurn;—  
Yet still I strive with the lengthy tides  
That prove once more, that none can tire.  

Enchanting visions nigh to soft  
And I am lifted in what life remains,
For I am but a lynchpin, borne
To seek the light beyond the endless range.

And all of this, unfolds in calm;
The peace is pure, in Harmony's Hand!
Let’er it fall, or break at last,
The sea shall sing forever on the sand.

- Lord Byron
