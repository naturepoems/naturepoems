The Twilight

In twilight’s gentle, golden haze, 
As daylight wanes in dusky gaze, 
The sounds of life begin to hush, 
While night-tide leaves us in the rush. 

The shadows weave their magic cloak, 
As crickets sing and willows stroke; 
A blanket spun of peace profound, 
We linger long, where dreams abound. 

The fading sun, a ball of fire, 
Sinks slow behind the earth’s desire; 
While stars ignite, in dim array, 
They usher in the close of day. 

O cherished time, the dusk’s caress, 
Within your depths my heart finds rest; 
In every twilight’s silent chime— 
An echo of eternity sublime.

- George William Curtis
