The river flows with a gentle song,
A melody of nature, sweet and strong,
It winds through valleys, sharp and wide,
A liquid ribbon, a graceful slide.

Its voice is laughter, its sorrow too,
An echo of life, forever true,
In its embrace, I lose my care,
For in the water, my spirit's bare.


- Feliksas Vaitkus
