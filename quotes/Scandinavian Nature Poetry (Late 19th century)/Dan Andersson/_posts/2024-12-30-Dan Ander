The Journey

Across landscapes painted in nature’s own hue,
I wander the path of the sun’s golden view.
With footfalls that echo, my heart sings a prayer,
In the beauty around, I am fully aware.

Each step is a blessing, each breath a delight,
In the arms of the world, my spirit takes flight.
As dusk stirs the skies with its kaleidoscope art,
I know in this journey, I’ve found a new heart.


- Dan Andersson
