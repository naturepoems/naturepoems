Autumn Song
  
I
The leaves are falling,
The leaves are swirling
In the chill wind.
They touch the ground
With soft, brown hands.

II
Like a multitude of whispers,
They gather to speak
Of the warmth and light.
But winter is closing in,
To hold all in its white hand.

III
Oh the crumbling branches,
The barren tree,
Still I find beauty
In the chill and the frost,
In the sun's last warmth.

                         - DH Lawrence
