O green mist rising with the dawn!
Each sinew of the earth awakes in dreams,
The luster shot through dew and warmth,
Trimming short dreams flaring from leaves, 
Past visions that drip along the edge,
Every ounce of length drawn out,
Leaning to embrace the breath.
Dandelions rise in gentle waves,
Whisper sweet maybes beneath the childâ€™s breath.
