A line will take us hours maybe;  
Yet, if it does not take us any further,  
What good is it?  
But when the sun is setting,  
And we see across the mountains,  
Hints of purple clouds,  
And hear the stream squeak  
Below the crags;  
There is a beauty,  
Even if we end up nowhere.

- Robert Frost
