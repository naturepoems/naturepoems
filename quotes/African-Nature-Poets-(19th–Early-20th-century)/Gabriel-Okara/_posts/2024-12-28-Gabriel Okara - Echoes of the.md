Echoes of the Forest
In the heart of the forest deep,
Where shadows dance and secrets sleep,
I find your spirit intertwined,
With every root, and vine aligned.

The rustling leaves murmur softly,
In daylight’s tender embrace,
Carrying stories of the lost,
In every moss-covered space.

This is where I draw my breath,
In the sanctuary of your depth,
Where nature sings an ancient hymn,
And the spirit of the earth grows dim.

- Gabriel Okara
