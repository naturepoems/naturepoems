The first snow of winter,
a blanket soft and white,
every detail softened,
especially the noise,
where silence becomes a symphony.

Crisp air bites at my cheeks,
a reminder of life’s edge,
yet in this chill, I find warmth,
wrapped in the beauty of transformation.

The world turns,
each flake a story,
a whisper of magic,
an ethereal dance,
as I breathe in the purity,
the promise of renewal,
a chance to start anew,
a gift from nature herself.

- Alice Walker
