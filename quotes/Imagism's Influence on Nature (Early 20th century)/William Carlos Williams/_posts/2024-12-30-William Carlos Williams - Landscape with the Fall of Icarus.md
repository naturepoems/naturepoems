Landscape with the Fall of Icarus
According to Brueghel
when Icarus fell
it was spring

A farmer was ploughing
his field

The whole pageantry
of the sun forbade
our sight of it.

But for a moment
and for a particular story
we catch it
all the shadowed waves
from awe-inducing.

the man who was falling,
a wheelbarrow toppled
near the water.

The rest of us stand
stillâ€”a formall light.

In the architecture of luck
what life may yet flow!

- William Carlos Williams
