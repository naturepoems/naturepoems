The Palms

The palms are beyond,
like evergreen wisps of skin,
swhile heals see intoicating
to shade; so can, all innocent.
They range the land
to pleasure what the sky gives.

There in eye shades,
satham as mercurial ceiling roofs.
The palms care not for scorching,
these sun-glows as the sea halts the feet
while giving its large proportions.


- Marianne Moore
