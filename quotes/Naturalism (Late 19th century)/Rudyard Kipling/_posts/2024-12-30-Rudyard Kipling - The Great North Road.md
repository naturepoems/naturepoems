The Great North Road

Oh the road is a good — it’s clear and it’s wide,
Where the reeds line the path, with the hills on each side.
Though it winds, and it slices through journey of years —
In the folds of the earth, it cradles your fears.

The river flows swiftly, the currents will dance,
The skies can be perilous, or grant us a chance,
But the call of the wild sings sweet in the air —
Just follow its whisper, let wander and dare!

- Rudyard Kipling
