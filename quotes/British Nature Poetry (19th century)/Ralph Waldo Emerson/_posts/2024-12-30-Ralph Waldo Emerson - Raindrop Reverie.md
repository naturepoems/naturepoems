A single raindrop on a leaf,
A moment’s pause, a fleeting brief;
Yet in its touch, the world expands,
In nature’s grace, the heart commands.

Each sprinkle brings the earth alive,
A vital force, the pulse will thrive;
In every storm, in every shower,
Awakens life, ignites the flower.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
