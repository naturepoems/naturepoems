Beneath the arch of ancient trees,  
Where shadows play and sunlight flees,  
The forest hums an ageless tune,  
And melodies rise with the afternoon.

Mossy carpets cloak the ground,  
While whispers of the woodland sound,  
A symphony of life yet brief,  
In nature's pulse, we find our relief.


- Vivienne Scott
