The Tale of the River

Winding like whispers through valleys green,
The river carries tales untold,
In soft sibilance, flowing between,
Old stones, young dreams, and secrets bold.

A mirror to mountains, a song to the breeze,
Ebbing in dances with the light,
Each bend, a moment, each ripple, a tease,
In the hearts of those that love the night.

As it hugs the banks with gentleness grand,
It beckons the wanderers to trace,
The paths of remembrance, through soft sand,
In heartbeats that echo, in soft embrace.

O, let me wander by your flow,
With each step, let your tales arise,
For in the riverâ€™s song, I know,
Lies the history written beneath the skies.

- Albert Samain
