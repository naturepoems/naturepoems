In quiet glades where shadows play,  
A dance of sunlight, a soft ballet.  
The wild deer steps with timid grace,  
In natureâ€™s arms, they find their place.

Green realms hidden, where secrets lie,  
Under the gaze of the sprawling sky.  
A dreamlike world, serene and pure,  
In tender moments, hearts find cure.

- Sigrid Undset
