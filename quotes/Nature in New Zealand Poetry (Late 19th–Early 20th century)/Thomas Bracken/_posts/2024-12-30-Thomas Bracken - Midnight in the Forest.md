MIDNIGHT IN THE FOREST

The moon hangs low, a silvery queen,
In a sky where the stars do play;
The forest whispers, its secrets keen,
As shadows dance on the grassy way.

The nightingale croons its tender song,
While shadows twist like a lover's sway;
The hush of the woods is deep and strong,
With Nature's embrace at the close of day.

Through silvered branches the breezes glide,
As the world dons a mystical veil;
In the still of the night where dreams abide,
The heart finds peace, where worries pale.

So linger, dear soul, in the forest deep,
Let the night cradle your weary head;
For in the woods, true wonders sleep,
In the gentle arms where the wild things tread.

- Thomas Bracken
