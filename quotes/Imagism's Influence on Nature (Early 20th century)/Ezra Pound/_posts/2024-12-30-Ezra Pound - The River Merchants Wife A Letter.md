The statue of Perseus;
Above the motion of things,
Twixt the green valley, between the blue hills,
Lies in the stillness.
Past the soft grass lies the marsh;
The city is a loud mirage,
The white shallows pulse and count.
Sweet is the air above the marshland;
Who has not sat where the willow weeps
In the hour of its grief?

- Ezra Pound
