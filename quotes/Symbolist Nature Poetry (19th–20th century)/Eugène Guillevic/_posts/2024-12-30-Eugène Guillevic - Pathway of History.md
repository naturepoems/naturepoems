On the pathway alone,
  each pebbled grain feels
      the footfall of history.
An iris blooms,
  scattering whispers,
  echoing the decisions of yesterday.
 
Every sighing branch
  sways, resembling
     the gentle curvature of thought.
Time rests its gaze on leaves,
  painting the sky with shadows,
  engraving warmth on the skin.

Here, silence is a river;
  here, breath hosts secrets,
  where the weathered stones
  whisper of the earth’s confessions.

Within the understated pulse
  of nature’s heartbeat,
  we find glimmers of wisdom,
   unearthing what is left unsaid.

Let this moment be the anchor,
  within which life expands.

- Eugène Guillevic
