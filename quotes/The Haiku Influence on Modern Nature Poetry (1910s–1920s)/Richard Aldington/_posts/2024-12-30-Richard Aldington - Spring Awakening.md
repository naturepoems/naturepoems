In the spring after the rain, 
The earth opens, fresh in its bloom,
The flowers awaken from slumber,
And each petal reveals a new story.

The sun kisses the day’s tender skin,
As life pushes forth with various songs,
In the colors of hope, I see the future,
Dancing high on the breath of the wind,
I’m one with the love that nature bestows.

- Richard Aldington
