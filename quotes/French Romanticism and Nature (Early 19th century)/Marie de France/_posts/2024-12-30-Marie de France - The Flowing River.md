The river flows with gentle pride,
A silver ribbon through the land.
In every twist and every glide,
It tells the tales of natureâ€™s hand.

Adventurous paths, the journey flows,
Through valleys deep, and hills that rise.
In every drop, the beauty glows,
As life reflects in endless skies.

- Marie de France
