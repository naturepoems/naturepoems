The Sea

The sea is a beautiful wild beast  
That tosses away its golden mane  
And rolls over the rocks like a wave  
Of mystery, fluttering foam  
That covers the grey stones.

I sit on the dizzy brink,  
Feeling the spray of salt on my face,  
And you are the only part of the shore  
This moment I can catch hold of  
Before I plunge into the sea.

- Amy Lowell
