author: William Carlos Williams
quote: "The pure white cloud
is blown to pieces;
leaves tumble from the trees,
dancing like a flame, 

and far above, a bird floats—
a perfect curve in the sky,
a whisper of sound.
The cold air touches your face.
The world moves as you breathe."

The pure white cloud
is blown to pieces;
leaves tumble from the trees,
dancing like a flame, 

and far above, a bird floats—
a perfect curve in the sky,
a whisper of sound.
The cold air touches your face.
The world moves as you breathe.

- William Carlos Williams
