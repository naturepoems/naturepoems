Eve’s Garden

In this garden, life unfolds,
Where shadows play and sunlight molds,
The petals pull against the morn,
In colors deep and life reborn.
Each fragrance couples with the dew,
In this sacred dance of hue,
And there beneath the ceaseless skies,
The heartbeat of nature lies.

With each whisper, the stories blend,
Of the cosmos, our unseen friends,
And in this tapestry of grace,
I find my peace, my sacred space.
