The Wandering

Upward she ached,
towards the scattered stars,
with dreams dissolving,
within the sweat of sleeping. 
For hours as she climbed
the way up the hill, 
seeking the dawn's embrace
upon morning's breath. 
Longing for dawn,
to spill their fierce morning down,
as a silver shimmer
upon the forest so deep. 



- Rainer Maria Rilke
