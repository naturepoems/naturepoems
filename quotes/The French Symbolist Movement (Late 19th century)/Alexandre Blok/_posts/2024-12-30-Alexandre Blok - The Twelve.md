The Twelve

City smolders with pieces of light,
Crimson tongues lick at the night; 
With the snows the cries of crows merge,
Across the worn-out streets a spirit will verge.

On autumn's turf lie the black tombs
Of men â€“ silent as the world looms,
Yet softly breathe the budding trees,
To the whispering winds and secret bees.

Nature wakes in savage glares;
Zigzagging shadows mask the squares,
The cold wind cries, as it seeks to beat,
The weary hearts of those in the street.

- Alexandre Blok
