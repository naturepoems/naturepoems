Nature’s Melody

Upon the hills where wildflowers fair,
  Enchanted melodies drift on the air;
  The brooklet babbles, a laughing song,
  And every creature hums along.

The robin trills on the budding bough,
  A custom earnest, cherished vow;
  While in the twilight, cool and mild,
  The fireflies dance, like spirits wild.

The evening star begins to gleam,
  A silver note in the sunset’s dream;
  As day transforms to night’s embrace,
  Nature holds a sacred place.

So let us gather 'neath velvet skies,
  And listen to the world’s sweet sighs;
  For in this grand celestial play,
  Nature calls us home, to stay.

- Constance Fennell
