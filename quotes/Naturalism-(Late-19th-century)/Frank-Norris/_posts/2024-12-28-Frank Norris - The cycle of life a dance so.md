The cycle of life, a dance so divine,
In forests where everything holds the line.
The breeze sings low through each bough and crest,
Breathing life into stillness, natureâ€™s behest.

Stars are the guardians of resonant night,
While moonlight drapes gently, casting its light,
To where nothing rushes, all flows with intent,
Each moment a treasure, in silence content.

The pulse of the earth thrums softly through me,
In rivers and valleys, my spirit roams free.
For nature is sacred; her voice is the same,
In her quiet witness, I call out her name.

- Frank Norris
