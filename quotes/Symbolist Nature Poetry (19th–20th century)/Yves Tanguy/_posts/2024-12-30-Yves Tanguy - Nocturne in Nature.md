Beneath the boughs where shadows dwell,  
The moonlight weaves in silken strands,  
An ancient tale that time will tell,  
Of dreams that dance on starry bands.

A rustling hush, as night unfolds,  
Nature sleeps in nebulous ties,  
In whispered breath, the world consoles,  
Beneath the gaze of watchful skies.


- Yves Tanguy
