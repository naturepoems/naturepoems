Oh, the soil of our ancestors, 
    rich and darkened by time, 
    every grain telling stories, 
    of struggles and triumphs, 
    of laughter and tears.  

With each seed we plant, 
    hope springs anew, 
    nourished by the rains, 
    kissed by the sun.  

The rhythm of agriculture, 
    a heartbeat against the land,
    breathing life into all things, 
    we are one with the earth.

Let the winds carry our prayers, 
    let the rivers sing our songs, 
    as the cycle of life unfolds, 
    and Nature grants her blessings.
