The world is filled with love and smoke,  
                      The world is filled with life,  
                   The light that walks on  
                          The waves and the sky,  
                With the languor of afternoon,  
                 To walk where the light-tangled hills  
                   Flare to light in a breath;  
                    
                 And with my bare feet in wet grass,  
                 I dance in wild laughter,  
                     In the light of the sun.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
