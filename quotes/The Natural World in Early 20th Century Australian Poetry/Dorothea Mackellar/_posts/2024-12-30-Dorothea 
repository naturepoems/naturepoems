In the Mountains

Up in the mountains grand and high,
Where the eagle soars and free,
There’s a heart of the wilderness,
In the peace of harmony.

With the air so crisp and golden,
And the skies of endless blue,
The peaks stand tall in silence,
Like ancient giants true.

And as I wander through the pines,
And breathe the world anew,
Nature's story swells around,
In every scent and view.

So I rest upon the mountains,
In the shadow of the trees;
For their presence speaks of wisdom,
And I find my spirit’s ease.

- Dorothea Mackellar
