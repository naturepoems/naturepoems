Sonnets for Pictures

Of such a need that comes to perfect deed,  
Beneath a still bright moon, and far more fair,  
Upon the morn eternal flowers laid bare;  
Illusions ripe in golden bloom did bleed.

Then shall the senses wake upon the leading,  
As scented steps bring April from the air,  
Till downright truth and heart awake with care,  
Through sculptured wood of ease that feels indeed.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
