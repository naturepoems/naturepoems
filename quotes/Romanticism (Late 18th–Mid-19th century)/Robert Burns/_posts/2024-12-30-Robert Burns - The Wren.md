The wren is one of Britain’s birds,
Its song more sweet than praise;
Through fields and follies it’s unheard,
Yet fills my heart with rays.

It jumps from bough to bough with glee,
As though it knows no care;
And in the morning light so free,
Sings joy that fills the air.

So here’s a toast to all that’s bright,
To nature’s sweet delight,
For every wren’s soft serenade
Is love’s own tender light.

- Robert Burns
