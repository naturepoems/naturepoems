The earth is a map,
a tapestry woven
with rivers of green,
a sprinkle of flowers,
each petal a question,
each blade of grass
an answer in motion.

Nature laughs loudly
in the clamor of colors,
shares its bright secrets
with those who watch,
poets with their pencils,
ready to embrace
the spell of the wild, 
drawing with breath.

- Cecilia Vicuña
