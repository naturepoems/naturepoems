On the Heath

A patch of blue, a silver glade  
  By ferny den,  
The moonlight flows above the glade,  
  And on the heath,  
In silence gone, a wind that blows  
  Along the fells,  
A breath of something understood,  
  While nature dwells,  
In solemn shadows, rich and deep,  
  Beyond the stars.  

â€“ Laurence Binyon
