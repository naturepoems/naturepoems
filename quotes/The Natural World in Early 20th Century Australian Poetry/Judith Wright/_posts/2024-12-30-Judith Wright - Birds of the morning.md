Birds of the morning

Let the wild ones sing the day
Let them sing above the earth,
The dark earth.

Not the soft ones,
With their murmurs and melancholy song,
But the wild ones, the bright ones
Singing primal music,
The fearless ones, the open ones,
Singing above the dusk and twilight;
Singing in the wind, the hot light
That strikes the memory clear.

Let them sing, the wild ones,
Let them sing the day in
And let the dark earth breathe again
And let the wild ones sing
To each other in the trees.


- Judith Wright
