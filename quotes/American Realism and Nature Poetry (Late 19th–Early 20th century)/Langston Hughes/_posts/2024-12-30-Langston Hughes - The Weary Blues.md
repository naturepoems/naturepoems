The Weary Blues
Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
I heard a Negro play.

Down on Lenox Avenue, the other night,
By the pale, dull pallor of an old gaslight
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical saw.

Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool,
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical saw.

And when the chatter echoes the soft refrain,
I thought of the weeping clouds,
Dreaming over the open sea at night.

- Langston Hughes
