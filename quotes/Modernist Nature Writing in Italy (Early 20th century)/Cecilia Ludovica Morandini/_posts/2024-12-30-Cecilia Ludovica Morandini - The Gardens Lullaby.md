The Garden's Lullaby

Among blooming petals,
the garden sings a lullaby,
where lilacs embrace the morning dew
and roses blush with the day’s first light.
Every stem a note,
every bloom a chord,
crafting melodies that float
on the whispering breeze.

Here in this living canvas,
colors collide, mingle,
a painter’s palette awakened,
while honeybees hum soft rhythms
and shadows gather with the setting sun,
we find moments suspended,
a breath caught in the foliage.

- Cecilia Ludovica Morandini
