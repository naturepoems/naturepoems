In the shadow of the great mountain,
you can hear the echoes of the ancients.

The stars above sparkle with wisdom,
a canopy of dreams woven in darkness.

Crickets sing their lilting serenade,
while the cool night air brushes your skin.

Each breath taken is filled with the essence
of wild thyme, of crisp earth, of peace.

- Kate Bush
