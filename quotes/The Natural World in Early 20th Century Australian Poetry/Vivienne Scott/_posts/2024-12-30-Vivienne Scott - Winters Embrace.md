The fragrance of pine in the crisp morning air,  
Whispers of winter linger there,  
As frost adorns the world in white,  
Transforming all to pure delight.

Each breath taken in this peace,  
Reminds us that, with every lease  
Of life, a bond we forge anew,  
In the arms of nature, love shines through.
