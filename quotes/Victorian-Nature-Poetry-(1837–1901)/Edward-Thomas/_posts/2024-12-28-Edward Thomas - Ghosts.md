Ghosts

Often, when I walk in the woods,
I hear a quiet sound that stirs—
A soughing, bending harmony,
The leaves wrapped in humid whispers.

There, at twilight, with the dusk so high,
I feel the ghosts of the long-lost trees—
Their hands that brush against mine, over the boughs  
Of far-off memories and the gentle miseries.

As time steals away the fullness of their days,
Their lingering watch sends throats afire.
I muse for a while and crave their graceful ways,
Stir until the fading dusk burns bright with desire.

— Edward Thomas
