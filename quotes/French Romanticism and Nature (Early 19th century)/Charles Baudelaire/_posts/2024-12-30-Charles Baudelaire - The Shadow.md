The Shadow

What dreams may dance in the shadowâ€™s embrace,  
Where daylight retreats and memories replace;  
Beneath the boughs where wild flowers groan,  
And the essence of nature whispers alone.

A sanctuary soft, where time drifts by,  
In the comfort of dusk beneath the wide sky;  
The shadows stretch out, a tender disguise,  
With secrets concealed in the wisdom of skies.

Let us lose ourselves in this twilight fight,  
For the night brings forth both sorrow and light;  
In the arms of the dark, we shall find our way,  
As the world pivots gently to end another day.

- Charles Baudelaire
