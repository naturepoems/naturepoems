To an Unknown Poet

Down in the valley silent lies,
Where the sun like a child has lost his way;
Upon the cross the shadow flies,
And opens a cradle to daylight's sway.
To the river unshuttered the bird calls,
To the flowers that lightly bloom,
And all the glances of banquet halls,
Break gently, as lilies show their plume.

- John Masefield
