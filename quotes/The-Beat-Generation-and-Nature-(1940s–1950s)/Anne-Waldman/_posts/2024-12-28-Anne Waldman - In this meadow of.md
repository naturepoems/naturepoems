In this meadow of thought,
a multitude of wildflowers,
Memories flicker,
every scent a dream,
every hue a heartbeat,
as I dive deep into the ground,
where roots intertwine,
quench our thirst,
each arcane tickle of dirt,
part of the whole.

Moonlight guides us,
Through night’s embrace,
Nature, a quilt of eternity,
leading us in.

I will chant with the sparks
of fireflies,
Find harmony in the quiet,
Each movement a prayer,
every stir, a beginning.


- Anne Waldman
