Ode to the Wilderness

Amongst the lofty hills, I stand,
Where silence reigns, away from noise,
In every wild and open land,
I’m comforted as Nature's voice.

Oh, Wilderness! my heart’s delight,
With open skies and valleys deep,
You cradle me in deep respite,
And in your arms, I dare to sleep.

The scent of pine, the whispering breeze,
The endless trails your wonders weave,
In you, Nature's heart finds ease,
And leaves me with no will to grieve.
