Winds of Dada  
Oh winds of Dada!  
Bring chaos to these fields,  
every blade of grass a manifesto,  
where meaning crumbles like earth,  
each gust a revolutionary call,  
each silence pregnant with light.

We are but whispers  
in the great giggle of the cosmos,  
blown across landscapes,  
a playground,  
a disruption—  
nature joyous  
in its defiance,  
where every laugh sent  
upturns the ordinary.

- Richard Huelsenbeck
