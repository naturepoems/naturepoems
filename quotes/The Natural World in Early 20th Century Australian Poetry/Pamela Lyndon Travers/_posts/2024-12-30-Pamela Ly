In quiet glades, where shadows lie,
The world is hushed, the air so sweet,
With every breath, we feel it sigh,
As tranquil moments, life’s retreat.

Among the trees, our worries fade,
In nature’s presence, we are whole,
In every glance, a bond is made,
The heart awakens, once more, console.

- Pamela Lyndon Travers
