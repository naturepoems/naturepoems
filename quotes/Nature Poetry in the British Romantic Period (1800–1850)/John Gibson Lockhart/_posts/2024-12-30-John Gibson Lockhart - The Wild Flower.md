THE WILD FLOWER

I.
Upon the meadow wide and grand,
A wild flower sways ‘neath the sky;
Unchained by bonds of a mortal hand,
In laughter, playful it does fly.

II.
As breezes clap in a joyous dance,
And sun beams mark its radiant grace,
In vibrant hues of life’s romance,
It offers charms to every gaze.

III.
No crown of gold it seeks to wear,
Nor privacy marks its gentle home,
Instead, beloved within the care
Of nature’s arms it likes to roam.

IV.
So, hear the rustle of its song,
That speaks of love with every scale,
In harm, so tender, it moves along —
For wildflowers tell what shall prevail!

- John Gibson Lockhart
