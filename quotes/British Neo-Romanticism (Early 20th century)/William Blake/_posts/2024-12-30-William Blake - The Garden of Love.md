The Garden of Love
I went to the Garden of Love,
   And saw what I never had seen;
A Chapel was built in the midst,
   And the gates of this Chapel were shut.

And 'Thou shalt not,' writ over the door;
   So I turned to the Garden of Love,
That so many sweet flowers bore,
   But the thorns were all I could see.

And priests in black gowns, who stood
   In the shadows at the altar,
Brought out their cords of loyalty,
   And the sacrifice of the world.

- William Blake
