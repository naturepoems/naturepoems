A little Snow was here and there,
A touch of winter's breath—  
The pattern of the life we know,
In snowy trumpet, wrapped in truth,  
Yet surely there is nothing like  
In that great mystic book—the sky—
That whirled above the Geminies,
And made our objects small and die,—  
Like winter's breath is never born  
And yet we hold our man-made seeds. –

- Emily Dickinson
