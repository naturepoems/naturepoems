Eternity

In the stillness of mountains, in the valley’s cry,  
Lies the essence of nature, of life, and of time;  
A whisper eternal, that reaches the sky,  
In the rhythm of seasons, in silence sublime.

Be it wind through the branches or sun on the lake,  
The heart of existence, where all spirits dwell;  
With every new breath, the earth starts to wake,  
In the language of life, Nature’s tale to tell.

Amidst the vast myriad, each moment we see,  
Is a snapshot of love that we finally yearn;  
In the beauty of nature, we find we are free,  
In the love and the peace that will ever return.
