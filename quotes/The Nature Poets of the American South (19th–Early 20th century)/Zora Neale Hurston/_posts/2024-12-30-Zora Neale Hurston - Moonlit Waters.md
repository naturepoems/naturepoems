When the moon bathe the lakes in light,
And stars awaken from their flight,
I wander where the waters gleam,
Each ripple holds a mirrored dream.

Soft winds bring tales of long ago,
Of times when nature’s heart would glow.
Oh, let me linger in this place,
Where time stands still, and dreams embrace.


- Zora Neale Hurston
