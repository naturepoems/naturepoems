The Nightingale

O Nightingale, that on yon bloomy spray,  
   Most musical, most mournful, dost thou wail  
   0,  how I long to hear thy voice, and weigh  
   Thy music in mine ears: for thee,  
   Singing amongst the boughs,  
   Travelling, almost, to the unseen sky;  
   O for that filling, trembling song!  
   But thou dost wane, now, and I cannot,  
   O Nightingale,  
   Hear thee, know thee, feel thee in my heart. 

â€“ Laurence Binyon
