Look at their leaves shimmer like green light,
Each branch tells a story, ancient and wise,
A whisper of the earth's soft, eternal fight."

The trees are trembling in the cool breeze,
Look at their leaves shimmer like green light,
Each branch tells a story, ancient and wise,
A whisper of the earth's soft, eternal fight.
