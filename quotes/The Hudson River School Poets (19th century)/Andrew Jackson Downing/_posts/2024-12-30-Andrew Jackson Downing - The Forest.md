The Forest
In the depth of the forest, where shadows creep,
Unbroken silence weaves a spell,
The old trees stand watch, their secrets to keep,
In their arms, thereâ€™s a magic to dwell.
Through ferns and wildflowers, the path winds on,
In the heart of the green, the soul finds its song.

- Andrew Jackson Downing
