For a Dead Friend

Beneath the naked, naked earth
  He lies where the bush is wild,
But I shall not forget him, Death,
  The tomb is not for the child.

Where he has gone, on the curling brinks,
  I hear the waters sing.
He quickened the air with careful links,
  He plucked the stones like a king.

He gathered joy where the blossom fell,
  He cursed the suns and the skies;
O he has gone from our sight and spell
  But he lives where the wild-rose lies.

He called the hills with a loverâ€™s cry,
  He laughed when the wet winds formed,
He is a child of the earth, and I
  Shall cower where the grasses swarmed.

Beneath the naked, naked earth
  He lies where the bush is wild,
But I shall not forget him, Death,
  The tomb is not for the child.

- David Campbell
