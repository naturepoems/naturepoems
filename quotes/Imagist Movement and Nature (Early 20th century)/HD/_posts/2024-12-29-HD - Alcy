Alcyone

The sun comes in, among the silver leaves
           The blossom breaks
Among the wet amaryllis,
The dim sky arches
      The shadows shiver mute.
Beneath the dim rose,
A whisper of wind sways
          In the soft stillness.
Lift up my eyes with thine—as the songbird sweeps
         Among the low hedges, 
Let our heart reawaken,
  As forage for the light above.

— H.D. (Hilda Doolittle)
