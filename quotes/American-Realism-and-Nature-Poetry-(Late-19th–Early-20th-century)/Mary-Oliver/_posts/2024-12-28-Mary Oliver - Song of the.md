Song of the Builders

The men are building a house.  They are the men who make their choices,  who pull their own nails,  who work in the sun and the rain,  who mix their own cement.
They are the men who will  also dance at the wedding,  who will shovel the snow,  who put up the fence, and  will gather the wood.
And as they build this house,  they are singing,  an old song, a new song,  that sounds of joy and freedom,  of strength and hope,  of life, and they are building  with their hands,  building their own house,  building their own lives.

- Mary Oliver
