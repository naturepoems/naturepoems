Night

When shadows stretch and silence breathes,
The world is wrapped in velvet dreams,
As night weaves through the swaying leaves,
In gentle folds of moonlit gleams.

The stars awake, a twinkling choir,
Each flicker whispers stories bright,
Of far-off worlds, of love’s desire,
In this expansive canvas night.

The nocturnal symphony unfolds,
A serenade of crickets’ cheer,
While owls in wisdom, secrets hold,
And every sigh becomes a tear.

So drift into this tranquil spell,
Let dreams descend like softest rain,
For in the night, all hearts can swell,
And every shadow knows our pain.
