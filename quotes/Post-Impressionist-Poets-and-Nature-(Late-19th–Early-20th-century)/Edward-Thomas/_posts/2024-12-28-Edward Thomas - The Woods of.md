The Woods of Coole
The woods of Coole are too dark to see,
By the moving trees so high and vast,
Lost in shadow, the river flows fast,
Lost in stillness the moon’s majesty.

Full of whispers from nightingales' call,
As if summoning ancient dreams to rise,
The where of boyhood—a half-made guise,
Here, nature broods over her solemn thrall.

- Edward Thomas
