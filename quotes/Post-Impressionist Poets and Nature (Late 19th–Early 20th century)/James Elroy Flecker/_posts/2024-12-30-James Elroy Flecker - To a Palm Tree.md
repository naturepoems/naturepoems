To a Palm Tree

O palm tree in the desert land, 
You weave a tale with every strand; 
Your gentle sway, a life divine, 
With roots that clench and branches shine.

The sun shall paint your face with light, 
In warm embrace, both day and night; 
A silent sentinel you stand, 
Embracing every grain of sand.

In your tall grace, a wisdom flows, 
Of ancient tales that never close; 
You touch the wind and kiss the sky, 
In your deep silence, spirits lie.

- James Elroy Flecker
