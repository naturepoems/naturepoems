A Glimpse of Spring

The crocus peeps above the ground,
And greets the sun with golden face;
The world awakes, a joyous sound,
As springtime claims its rightful place.

The ice melts down the frozen streams,
And robins chirp in every bough;
The earth, renewed, fulfills our dreams,
As life returns to us somehow.

- Rosa Zagnoni Marinone
