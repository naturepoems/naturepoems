The Wild  
   
O wild and free, the untamed land,  
Where spirit roams and silence reigns,  
In every path, I take a stand,  
In nature’s heart, the solace gains.  
  
From mountains high to valleys low,  
In every creature’s call I hear,  
The sacred pulse of life that flows,  
A hymn of nature, sweet and clear.  
  
The wild, a world of mystery,  
In every breath, I feel its grace,  
In harmony, a symphony,  
With nature’s touch, I find my place.

- Herman Melville
