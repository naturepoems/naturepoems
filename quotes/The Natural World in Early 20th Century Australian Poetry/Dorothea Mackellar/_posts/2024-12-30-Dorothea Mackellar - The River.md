The River
O, my heart is taken in by the river,
With its murmurs of stories unheard,
And the rocks which stand firm as a giver,
Of history, loveâ€”always stirred.

Each twist and turn tells of treason,  
Of bonds that once broke not apart,
So I linger where dreamy visions  
Flow on the waters of art.

- Dorothea Mackellar
