THE IDEA OF ORDER AT KEY WEST

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind
Of man; so he was free
As to her inverted heart
As to the hermit who, alone
In the mountains, watched them rise
And fall and roll.

She sang of the world and he heard.
He could only think of the clear sky
And the unique waves of the sea.
They came together, in the flow
Of her lovely song and the rain.
The world was never a world
Without her song, without the waves
Hearing her note beyond the sea.

- Wallace Stevens
