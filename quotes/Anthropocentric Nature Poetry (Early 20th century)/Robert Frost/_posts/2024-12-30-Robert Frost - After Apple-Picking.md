After Apple-Picking
My long two-pointed ladder’s sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still,
And there’s a barrel that I didn’t fill
Beside it, and there may be two or three
Apples I didn’t pick upon some bough.
But I am done with apple-picking now.
Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.
I cannot shake the shimmer of this sight.

The bounce of apples I didn’t pick is growing in  
My blood to a pleasant, ear-popping drowse.

I am done with apple-picking now,
For I have all I need to carry past  
To another world beyond this one.  
What still remains is the scent of apples  
And the memory of the boughs I bent,  
The feeling of the ground that yielded.  
What still remains is the wisdom of harvest:  
The accumulation of empties which show that  
Half of the apple belonged to the tree,  
The half I didn’t harvest weighed, the bearded  
Hearts of flowers and their gone-away scent;  
I am finished with apple-picking now.

- Robert Frost
