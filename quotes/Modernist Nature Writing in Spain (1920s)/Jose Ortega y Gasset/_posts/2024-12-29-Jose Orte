Among the rocks, the wildflowers bloom, 
Their tenacity a lesson taught;
In the harshest terrains, life defies,
With colors that defy the gray,
A tapestry woven with the strength of spirit.

Listen closely, and the earth speaks,
In a language known to those who seek,
Connection in every leaf that turns,
In the cycles of life, the pulse of all,
In harmony, we find our truest selves.

- Jose Ortega y Gasset
