Under the canopy of the heavens,
   I find the embrace of nature,
   a quilt woven from dreams,
   where each stitch tells a tale.
The canopy offers sanctuary,
   an invitation to wander,
   among the echoes of the ancients,
   the spirits of the forest.

With every step, I delve deeper,
   lost in the magic of green,
   where the light filters through,
   casting shadows of possibility.
Here, on this sacred earth,
   I am reminded of my origins,
   of the ties that bind,
   of the laughter shared
   by the leaves and the wind.

In every rustle, every sigh,
   I hear the pulse of life,
   and as I walk on this path,
   I become one with the song,
   an eternal part
   of this beautiful wild.

- Alda Merini
