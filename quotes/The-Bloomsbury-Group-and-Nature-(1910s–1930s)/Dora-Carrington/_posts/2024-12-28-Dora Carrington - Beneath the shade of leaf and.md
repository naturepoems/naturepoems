Beneath the shade of leaf and vine,
Where thoughts entwine with nature’s shrine,
Each breath I take, a fragrant blend,
Of earth and sky with love to send.
The blossoms hum their soothing tune,
As swallows dance 'neath silver moon,
The vibrant hues beguile the eye,
While nature's heart breathes soft and high.

In twilight's arms, the stars arise,
Like candle flames in velvet skies,
And as the world begins to rest,
The pulse of life still weaves its quest.
O Nature, timeless, pure, divine,
You write in me your sacred line,
With every touch, a memory flows,
In gentle grace, my spirit grows.

- Dora Carrington
