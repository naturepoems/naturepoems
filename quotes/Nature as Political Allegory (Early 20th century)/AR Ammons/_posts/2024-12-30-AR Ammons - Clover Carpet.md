Sweetness of clover underfoot,
a carpet of nature’s unpretentious grace,
while above, the clouds congregate,
liquid thoughts seeping to earth’s cool skin,
the captured heart of summer.

Every breath feels broad, as if
every feeling could lay down next to a star,
establishing a dialogue,
each heartbeat a note in an infinite song.
