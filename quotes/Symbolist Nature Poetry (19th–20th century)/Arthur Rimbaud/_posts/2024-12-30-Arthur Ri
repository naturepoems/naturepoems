Ah! The breeze that kisses the tranquil lake,  
Where reeds bend low and water falls,  
In shadows cast, where peace awakes,  
Whispers of the woods where nature calls.  
With every twilight’s serene embrace,  
The world shimmers beneath the night’s sound,  
In nature’s arms, I’ve discovered my place,  
Among the echoes, where love is found.  

From 'The Poet'

- Arthur Rimbaud
