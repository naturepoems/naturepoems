A WINTER'S NIGHT

The winter's night is long and cold,  
Where frost hangs nigh on every bough;  
But in the hearth there is a glow,  
And shadows dance like ancient vows.  
Outside the hills are clothed in white,  
Yet within our hearts, the fire does sing,  
A sound of nature’s warmth and might,  
Of tender love and gentle spring.


- Walter Deverell
