The Mountains Sing
See rising from the earth so high,
The mighty mountains touch the sky,
In clouded veils, they wear their crown,
Those rugged kings of earth and stone.

With every dawn they break the dark,
Each sunset’s blush, a hallowed mark,
They watch the seasons come and go,
In silence hold the ancient glow.

Mountains, masters of the earth,
Your stillness bears our humble worth,
In your embrace, both fierce and kind,
We find the peace the world left behind.

Let me dwell amongst your heights,
Where nature’s spirit calls at nights,
In every shadow, every light,
The mountains sing, my soul takes flight.

- J C R Selwyn
