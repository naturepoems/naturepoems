The Silver Stream
 
A silver thread through mossy stones,  
A gentle sound, a bubbling tune,  
The water sings in tranquil tones,  
Reflecting sun and silver moon.  

It winds its way through vale and hill,  
Caressing life in every bend,  
A timeless flow, a force of will,  
Where nature’s heart begins to mend.

- Edward Burne-Jones
