The Nymph Complaining for the Death of her Fawn
I
I stood in a condition of despair
Upon a river bank in grief and pain;
My thoughts did ponder on my fawn so rare,
Who once was glad and frolicked there in rain.

II
O Fawn! sweet Fawn! 'tis pain to think of thee,
Where is thy gentle form, where is thy grace?
Thine eyes like morning dew, they danced with glee,
And I am left alone to mourn thy face.

III
Now I must wander through the woods alone,
Where once we played in merry, happy cheer,
Thy place is lost, as lost I ever moan,
And all the world around me feels more drear.

IV
So let the whispers of the breeze go by,
With every branch, it echoes back my sigh.


- Michael Drayton
