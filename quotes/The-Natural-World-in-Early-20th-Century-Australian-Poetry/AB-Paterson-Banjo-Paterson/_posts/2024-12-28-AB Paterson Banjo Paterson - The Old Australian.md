The Old Australian Game
A great game as we know it,
With teams of skill and heart,
In the echoing fields of green,
Where the thunder of hoofs depart.

With the wind in our faces,
And the roar of the crowd to cheer,
In the bush of old Australia,
The old game draws us near.

- AB Paterson Banjo Paterson
