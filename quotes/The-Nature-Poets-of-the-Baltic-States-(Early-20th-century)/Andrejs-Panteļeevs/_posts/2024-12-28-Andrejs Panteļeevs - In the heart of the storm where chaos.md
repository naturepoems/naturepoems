In the heart of the storm, where chaos resides,
Nature rumbles deeply with energy fierce,
Yet in the eye lies a peace that abides,
A calm in the tempest that shadows and pierces.

The earth quakes and trembles, but still it stands strong,
With roots intertwined, a symphony plays,
In the wildest of sounds, there echoes a song,
Of life’s endless cycle, through dark and through rays.

- Andrejs Panteļeevs
