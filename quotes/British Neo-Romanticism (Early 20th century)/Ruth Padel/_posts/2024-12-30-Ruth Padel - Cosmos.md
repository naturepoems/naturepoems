Cosmos
On a clear night, the universe unfolds,  
stars glimmer like secrets whispered  
in a language of light,  
outstretched hands longing to connect.

Distant galaxies pulse with life,  
as I lie beneath their vast,  
unyielding gaze,  
a speck of dust in the cosmic tale;  
yet I am connected to it all,  
this web of energy that binds us.

The night sky, a canvas,  
paints the deep silence within me,  
as I breathe in the wonder  
of being alive,  
and part of this mystery.

- Ruth Padel
