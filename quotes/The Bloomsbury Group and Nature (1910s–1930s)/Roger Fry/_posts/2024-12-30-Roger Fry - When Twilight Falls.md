When twilight falls, the stars invite,
 Each glowing spark, a dance of light.
 The moon dips low, a silver friend,
 As whispers of the night descend.

 The cricket's song, the softest breeze,
 The sigh of trees, among the leaves,
 In nature's arms, we find our peace,
 A world where time and worries cease.


- Roger Fry
