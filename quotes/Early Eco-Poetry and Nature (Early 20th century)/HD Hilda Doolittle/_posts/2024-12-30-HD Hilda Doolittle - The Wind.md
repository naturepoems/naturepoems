The wind, bursting the dust
of moss buds,     
in unfurled spaces,  
in slants of wind mought  
rather sweetly,  
- is as a desolate wanderer.
Call out to me,
he is amber colored,  
only but low,  
only over my breast; 
of a lass, deep in sense,  
where all sounds are lies.  
The rich  
- sun calls, I, slow, 
unfold of my petals,  
where all men uncover me-  
in the dawn.

- HD Hilda Doolittle
