In the spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.
In the summer the burden of heat bears down upon the earth,
In the autumn the leaves fall like whispers from the trees,
And in the winter, silent snow blankets all,
Each season lingers a moment, touching the heart,
Fleeting images of nature caught in a tender art.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
