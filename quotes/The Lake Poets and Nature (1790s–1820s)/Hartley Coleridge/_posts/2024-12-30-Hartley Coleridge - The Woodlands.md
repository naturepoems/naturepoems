The Woodlands

Where the cedar and the oak inspire,  
The woodlands weave a warm attire;  
With softest moss and leafy beds,  
They cradle life where silence treads.

Here, in the shade of hoary trees,  
The whispers kiss the wandering breeze;  
And nature's heart beats strong and true,  
In every branch, in every dew.

Through tangled paths where shadows fall,  
I wander lost in nature's call;  
With every step, a tale's revealed,  
In sacred woods, my heart is healed.

- Hartley Coleridge
