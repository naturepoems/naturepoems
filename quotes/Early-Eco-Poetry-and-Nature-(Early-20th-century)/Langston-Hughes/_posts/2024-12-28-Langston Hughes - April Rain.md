April Rain Song

Let the rain kiss you.
    Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops.
Let the rain sing you a lullaby.

The rain was made for love.
    Oh, you will miss it if youâ€™re never wet.
You will miss a delicious gift of life,
    If you never have your fill of rain.

- Langston Hughes
