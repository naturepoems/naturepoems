Indeed, I have had my share of storms,
I have seen the gaze of the frowning sky,
And felt the tempest rage beneath my arms,
When I did not know how to calm or fly.

I have lingered on treacherous buskin shores,
And yonder horizons stretched my thrilling heart,
Nature in her splendor opening many doors,
Sharing her softest keysâ€”the greatest art.

- Robert Herrick
