ON A SUMMER NIGHT
In the warmth of the night where the stars softly shine,
The world takes a breath as the moonlight divine
Weaves a tapestry of shadows on land,
While the heart beats in rhythm with the universe’s hand.

Here the quiet surrounds me in nature's embrace,
As the crickets are singing their sweet, soothing grace;
With each flicker of light, new dreams start to awake,
In the stillness of summer, where my heart shall partake.

So I lay on the ground, feeling earth in my soul,
Where the universe whispers, and the night makes me whole;
Through the lushness of summer, I find I am free,
As the night sings its beauty, forever with me.

- Charles GD Roberts
