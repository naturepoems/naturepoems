flora! O loveliness,
That thy heart should cease to be,
Did beauty, smiles, and all of this,
Doth live and die, as thine knew me:
So here, dear “flora” kiss me now
Soft among the perfumed flowers,
Thy looks so sweet that they would tear  
The deeper sorrow into hours.

— "Flora"

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
