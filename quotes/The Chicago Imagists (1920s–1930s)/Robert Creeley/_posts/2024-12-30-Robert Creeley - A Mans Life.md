A Man's Life

Life is all about what comes and goes.
  There is a cycle to it, you see,
bird flying up high,
  below the wind
    sways the trees,
each time knowing and yet forgiving.
For nothing is lost in this bright falling,
  just as even now,
you go,
  I am here.
The morning light breaks in,
  drapes across the ground,
and each breath we take is better
  than the last.


- Robert Creeley
