Upon the mountains high,  
Where the eagles soar,  
And the winds roar loud  
In the cold, clear air,  
Life pulses briefly,  
A fleeting breath of spring.

Here the granite stands  
Guarding the horizon,  
And the glacial streams  
Glide gracefully through valleys,  
Carving tales of beauty  
In the silence of the stone  
Where time itself stands still.

Amidst this rugged wild,  
The delicate flowers bloom,  
Tiny gems of color  
Planted by nature's hand,  
Resilient and bright,  
They dance in the chill breeze,  
A testament to the strength  
Of creation in fierce places.

- Fritjof Nansen
