The Sound of Trees
I wonder about the trees.
Why do we wish to bear
Forever on our backs
The dead leaves of autumn;
How can we ride, yet secretly desire,
One day, somehow!

The old dark trees are a-bound above,
And out at night, even if we can feel
The slender twigs that grasp at the stars,
What is it truly that we want?

- Robert Frost
