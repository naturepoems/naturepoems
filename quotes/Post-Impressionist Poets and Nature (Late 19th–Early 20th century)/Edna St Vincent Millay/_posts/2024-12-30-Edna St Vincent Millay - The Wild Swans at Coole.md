The Wild Swans at Coole

The trees are in their autumn beauty,
The woodland paths are dry,
Under the long leaves, the sky
Is hard and high.

Under the October twilight the water
Meets the sky;
A line of greyish leaves hanging
And a flock of wild swans fly.

Their feathers are white,
Silent as a thought hovering abstractly
In the azure, like a sigh.

And the smell of the autumn wind
And the rustle of branches pry.
Only a wild owl calls, a soft coo;
What is it to the beauty of life?

I have looked upon those swans,
With a melancholy heart in view;
For I am unmade by thoughts
Of the love, that died in winter's new.

And cubless one
The ones of the hummingbird’s who flew,
Then flickering like wild swans,
At dawn the quest for life anew.


- Edna St Vincent Millay
