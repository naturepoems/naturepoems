Sweet mountains! Oh, my country Edwin  
How often had I laid on the pine—  
Told how your fancy dimmed  
So rare, retreating Eyes—  

Rills enchained! Through mazy rills  
It seemed to me the reason,  
But when you laid  
Your Pillow down  

O’er me  
My Emerald Hero Knight!  
You filled the rocky closes  
For they were abreast with Joy,  

Outgrowing in my Heaven  
Each Dedication on the Hill!  
I loved the communication  
Of Vetus Nature’s ground—  


- Emily Dickinson
