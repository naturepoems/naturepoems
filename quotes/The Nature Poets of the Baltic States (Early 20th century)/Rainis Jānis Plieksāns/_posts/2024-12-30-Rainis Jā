Jāņi

The golden sun at noon’s embrace,
The fields adorned in joyful grace,
As laughter floats on summer’s dew,
Oh, Jāņi, life is bright and true.

The bonfires leap, the songbirds sing,
In every heart, the warmth of spring,
The balance held ‘twixt night and day,
In this sweet time, we find our way.

With hands entwined, we dance around,
In nature’s arms, our spirits found,
Oh, fire of life, your light we hold,
A tapestry of tales retold.
