In fields of yellow and gold, 
The wildflowers blossom and sway,
Their beauty is a fleeting glimpse,
Of summer's gentle, warm embrace.

The sky above, a vast canvas, 
Painted in shades of blue and white,
A world bursting with potential, 
Breathes life into our restless dreams.

With each rustle of the leaves, 
The trees guard secrets untold,
Whispering tales of the ancients, 
In an orchestra of nature's song.

- Giorgio de Chirico
