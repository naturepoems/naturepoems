author: Ezra Pound
quote: "The river flowed, clear as glass,  
   reflecting the sky so bright,  
   where the willows dipped and danced.
    
   A whispering breeze among the leaves,  
   secrets carried on soft wings,  
   nature's pulse beats strong and wide.
    
   In the gentle rain, petals unfold,  
   a symphony of colors bloom,  
   beauty in ephemeral grace."

The river flowed, clear as glass,  
   reflecting the sky so bright,  
   where the willows dipped and danced.
    
   A whispering breeze among the leaves,  
   secrets carried on soft wings,  
   nature's pulse beats strong and wide.
    
   In the gentle rain, petals unfold,  
   a symphony of colors bloom,  
   beauty in ephemeral grace.
