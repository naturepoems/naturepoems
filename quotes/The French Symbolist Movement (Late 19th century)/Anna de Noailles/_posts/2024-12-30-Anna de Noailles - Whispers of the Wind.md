Wind gently stirs the leaves of the trees,
An echo of whispers among the boughs;
O, how nature dances and sways,
Celebrating the silent symphony of time.

Sunlight filters softly through petals,
A golden veil over all living things;
Echoes of laughter, a gentle breeze,
Melding human hearts with nature's song.

- Anna de Noailles
