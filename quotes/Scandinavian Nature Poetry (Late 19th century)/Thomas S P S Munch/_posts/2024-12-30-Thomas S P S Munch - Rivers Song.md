River’s Song
Winding through the emerald woods,
the river flows with gentle cheer,
its laughter weaves through ancient hoods,
a whisper sweet for all to hear.

Stone by stone, it carves its tale,
a liquid brush on nature's canvas,
where sun and shadow weave a veil,
the murmurs echo, alluring and grand. 

Beneath the boughs, life swirls anew,
a world of wonder, teeming, bright,
with every ripple, stories accrue,
a river’s song, pure and light.


- Thomas S P S Munch
