The Wind

Today I heard the wind  
  and the sway of the trees  
  that lean against the stars.  
 
It is wild and free  
  like the sea:  
Nothing is lost or shattered;  
 
All my thoughts mix with water  
  and spiral back to the depths,  
  catching old wishes like shells  
 
That wear their soft glow  
  from the time of its thoughts—  
  How I will gather them,  
 
And weave them back in the dream  
  that I wake in.
