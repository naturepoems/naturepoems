The Wind's Whisper

In the stillness of dawn,
the wind whispers secrets
to the waking earth,
telling tales of travels,
where it has been,
where it will go,

a dance of life,
a touch upon the skin,
carrying with it the scent
of blooming flowers,
a tender caress,
that stirs the heart.

I listen,
as the trees bend in agreement,
a chorus of green,
reminders of the beauty
that sways around me,
in the gentle cadence,
each hush a memory,
a future yet to unfold.

Through the whispers of the wind,
I find my place,
and the world breathes with me,
shimmering beneath this celestial dome,
as we weave together,
a tapestry of existence,
a song that holds
us all in its embrace.


- Diane di Prima
