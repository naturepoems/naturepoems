Birches  
When I see birches bend to left and right  
Across the line of straighter, darker trees,  
I like to think some boy’s been swinging them.  
But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay.  
As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them  
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning  
After a rain. They click upon themselves  
As the breezes budge them. And though they are  
Bent oddly away from the Live Branches,  
Unless you’ve seen the icing, you would never know.

- Robert Frost
