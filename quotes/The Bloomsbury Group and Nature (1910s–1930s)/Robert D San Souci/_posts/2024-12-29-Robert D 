As dusk descends with velvet grace,
And stars emerge to light the space,
The world transforms in shadows deep,
Where nature's secrets drift to sleep.

With every night, a tale unfolds,
In cosmic wonders, life beholds,
A dance of spirits, dark and bright,
In nature’s heart, I find my light.

- Robert D San Souci
