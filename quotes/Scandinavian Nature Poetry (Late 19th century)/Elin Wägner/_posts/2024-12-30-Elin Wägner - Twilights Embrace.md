In twilight's glow, the shadows creep,
As nature sinks into her sleep.
The stars awaken, softly bright,
To watch over the world by night.

The moon’s embrace, a silken thread,
Weaves through the trees, as daylight fled;
In this stillness, peace descends,
A nightly gift that never ends.

- Elin Wägner
