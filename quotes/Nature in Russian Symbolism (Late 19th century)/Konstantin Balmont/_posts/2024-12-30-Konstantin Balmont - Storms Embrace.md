When the storm clouds gather fiercely,
  And nature rumbles with her might,
  I find a home in fierce emotion,
  In thunder's roar, in flashes bright.
  
  For within each clash, a sacred beauty,
  In nature's rage, a vital hymn,
  I dance amidst the wild chaos,
  Reveling in the life within.

- Konstantin Balmont
