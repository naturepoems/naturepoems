Autumn Leaves
  
  The autumn leaves fall gently down,
  In golden spirals to the ground;
  A robe of colors, rich and brown,
  Is spread where once the green was found.
  
  Each leaf, a story, whispered low,
  Of summer days and sunlit cheer;
  Their rustle sings a soft hello,
  To winter’s chill that soon draws near.
  
  They dance to earth in crisp farewell,
  Their fleeting beauty, time’s embrace;
  In nature’s heart, they weave and swell,
  A fleeting glimpse of love and grace.
