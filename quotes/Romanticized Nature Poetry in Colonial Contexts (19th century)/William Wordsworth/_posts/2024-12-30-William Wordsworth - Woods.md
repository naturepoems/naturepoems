I have found much in my heart,
And I would give a deal of my heart,
To find an echo of that world,
Where nature speaks to nature, where love shares in the art.

And I know, hereupon the winds still blow,
For all that I can see, though hidden in some form,
They hold the power to rise, and let it go,
On into the away.

So take the heart, and reach for earth,
As long as its strength shall stir the air,
For I will offer all I have,
To challenge the power at the very root of despair.

- William Wordsworth
