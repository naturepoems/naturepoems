Now fades the glimmering blue of the skies,  
And twilight descendeth with a rosy hue;  
The shadows of evening begin to arise,  
While stars play hide-and-seek on the dew.

To the softly blowing winds on high,  
I summon the dreams of the slumbering night;  
The nightingale sings, and the starlings sigh,  
As the moon casts silver on the world in flight.

So hush, O heart! as the daylight wanes;  
Let peace enfold you like summer's bower;  
The beauty that wanes is ever a gain—  
For shadows deepen the magic hour.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
