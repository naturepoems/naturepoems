The Spring Awakening

In spring's embrace, the world will wake,  
New life emerges, bright and awake.  
From frozen ground, the green will rise,  
A burst of color beneath the skies.
  
Birds return with songs so sweet,  
Nature's rhythm, a joyful beat.  
In every bud, a promise speaks,  
The heart rejoices, for spring it seeks.


- Halfred Lee
