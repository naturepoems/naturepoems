The Light of Other Days

Through the woodlands of the West,
Where the skies are always blue,
There are visions yet unguessed
Of the things we still must do;
We must wander on and on
Through the golden days of yore,
'Til we find the loved and lost,
In the beauty of the shore.

There are forests yet untried;
There are rivers yet unknown;
There are wilds that men have spied;
There are pastures not yet sown.
We must battle—not in vain—
For the hope and truth we prize,
And we'll find in every pain,
All the beauty of the skies.

- Henry Lawson
