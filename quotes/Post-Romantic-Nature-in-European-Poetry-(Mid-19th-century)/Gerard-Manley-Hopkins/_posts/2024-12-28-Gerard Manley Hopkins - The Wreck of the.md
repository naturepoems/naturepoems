The Wreck of the Deutschland

If thou couldst see, though all unknowing 
    At the corner of the path where the way would lie 
    With understanding’s door ajar, at the high sea 
    Swift tide, driven to places far; 
    Then is there fright or fury ’gainst me living?

The mighty ship, lost to lord at rest, 
    is the same, her beauty glowing still.  
    And as fierce wild dreams disappear  
    Restored and the last torn land, the level head, ~
    My moody soul must know that I do not fear.

                                                        -- Gerard Manley Hopkins, 1885
