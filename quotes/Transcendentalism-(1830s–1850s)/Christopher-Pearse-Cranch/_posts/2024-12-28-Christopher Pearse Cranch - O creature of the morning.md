O creature of the morning light,
Thine essence blooms in sacred song,
Among the dew-drenched leaves, so bright,
You whisper, ravishing and strong.

Your flutter through the fragrant glade,
Thy zestful flight, a rhapsody,
In every grain and stem displayed,
You breathe sweet life so heavenly.

In meadows we shall dance and play,
As nature holds our humble hand,
With colors spun in bright array,
We’ll tread together on this land.

So gather joy, for life is heard—
In every breath, in love conferred.

- Christopher Pearse Cranch
