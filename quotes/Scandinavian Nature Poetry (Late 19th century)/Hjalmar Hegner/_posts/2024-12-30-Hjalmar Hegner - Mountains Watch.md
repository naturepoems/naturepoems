The mountains rise against the sky,  
With snowy crowns and valleys rich,  
They grip the clouds and hold them high,  
A timeless dance, a perfect pitch.

Each peak a guardian, strong and bold,  
That watches over earthâ€™s domain,  
In silence, stories still untold,  
Of seasons passed and sun and rain.

- Hjalmar Hegner
