Winter Rain
The winter rain is falling
On the leaves and boughs,
It patters softly on the roofs,
And taps against the walls.

The days grow shorter,
The nights grow long,
And the trees are bare,
In the cold, grey sky,
The whispers flutter by.

Let the winter rain wash
  my heart of pain,
And let me dance again
  in the falling rain.

- Langston Hughes
