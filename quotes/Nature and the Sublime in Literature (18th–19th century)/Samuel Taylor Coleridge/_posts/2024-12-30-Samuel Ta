**The Lime Tree Bower My Prison**  
O! my dear native Vale,  
I shall forever love thee;  
In all these scenes, I do find  
Of nature’s glow, a favor still!  

Ah! merrily did I dwell,  
With sweet and merry friends I found;  
But those forms of men and earth,   
Strain still a pensive mood—ground.  

My thoughts among these autumn leaves are free;  
My spirit’s drenched  
In dew from spring!  
My senses are awake,  
And take delight.  
I see all heaven beneath the trees.  

A dove that made me feel it so;  
My heart awakes to breathe;  
This glade feels keenly sweet;  
Beneath the bough tree.  

And flowers that bloom betwixt the gym;  
'Tis more, their tints have silvered leaves;  
Let me alone!  
Hence good-bye!  
The thing I love is gone—again.  

**The Growth of Love**  
As with each breath, as I breathe so low,  
Resents behold of world,  
And loud, I’re lost, that thee!  
Thy solid worth, my gentle friend!  
The sun doth rise!  
The morn is here, I cannot longer see;}  
But not in vain!  
From vale to vale;  
And it meets the world, with pure intent.  

In wooing shoots between us two,  
And loving hearts that envy still;  
Glance from each other in the light,  
I feel around, in that ray, I still,  
I see it shining with envy;  
Thy warmth, my own!  

O! my grave—still, I can see—  
The pleasures, there, I see through and through;  
I meet with joys through those sweet things;  
How I treasure words to tell of them,  
That nature flows through you.  

**To a Young Ass**  
I  
Although thy painful look, sweet emblem of  
Dulness, and bitter cheer;  
Thus linger long in sight,  
O come! sweet Boldness—look!  

O gray! O green!  
I see your bright green undulate  
In shade as through the bough  
That thee fill with thought!  

Much love the Spring-time’s glad;  
Come, therefore, let’s feast!  
Thus nature sings for thee;  
Therefore I cherish thoughts of bee.  

To see that field, and brisk”—to say  
Yet nothing, truly can my mind  
Embrace of them.

**The Flower that Smiles Today**  
The flower, that smiles today,  
Tomorrow, will be dead;  
But that which is of famed  
Remains forever, sure!  

Through seasons, glorious night:  
All bright below and above,  
Doth charm me yet not thee:  
Thou breathed within my soul.  

At darkness fades from day,  
That serene sun shall rise and vie  
Across the heavens glowing bright.  

To you, the muse of life;  
My joy shall turn again,  
Into the rapture there!  

Though time may bring a grave!  
Yet don't me bring to feel,  
That evening light shall turn!

**The Wanderer**  
I wander through the shadows dim,  
And daylight falls upon the stream;  
How softly flows the liquid gleam,  
That seemeth ever thus to swim.  

Out of the depth of all I see,  
What meaning of tale  
Conceals the flowers of emerald?  
I see bright daisies, low and small,  
With velvet leaves, a lovely throng;  
The fancy flows, that reign my soul!  
But scarce my embrace, of woe;  
If thoughts return with absence now;  
Yet ever so—they mock my boast,  
I cannot touch them still!  

Their music reigns upon my heart,  
And feathered song that loud and clear;  
In all that gentleness, it’s sheen!  
O nature exquisitely bright!  

But warm the lands, in autumn pale;  
Oh! lend this to my hope!  
Feels e’er-on; can I forget it?  
What wonder is this through that day,  
Rests fond in summer-skies?  

**The  Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey**  
Five years have passed; five summers, with the length  
Of five long winters! and again I hear  
These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs  
With a sweet inland murmur. – Once again  
Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,  
Which on a wild secluded scene impress  
Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect  
The landscape with the quiet of the sky.  

The Day that ev’ry family  
Life wakes and brings stillness, would bind my song.  
This is to believe, that  
‘Tis still the same,; I shall not die.  

The spirit in the mountain-vista;  
The treasured thoughts thus bind me soaring near,  
I feel it’ll be now decay;  
But that my hopes may vanish yet!

**Song of the Pixies**  
O twin of spright! dark eyes with soft curls!  
Dance once again o’er sparkling streams!  
Ye scatter all ways, be glad!  
Let every brook breathe pure;  
Run in laughing glee,  
The mother’s heart!  
And see every flower!  
Let no thorn see the bush!  

Let’s charm the silken air!  
There sweeps all shapes, up some cold stream,  
The dawn blooms, and sadness fulsome stalks!  
O ye—be free!  
I feel conclu’d by the spring,  
Let bubbles rise ‘twixt my songs!  
For every shade, shall close and part;  
I feel near this!

- Samuel Taylor Coleridge
