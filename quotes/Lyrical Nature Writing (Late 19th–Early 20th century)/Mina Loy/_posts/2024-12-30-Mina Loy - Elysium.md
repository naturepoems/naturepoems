In silence—an invitation,
Fauna and flora shake hands, a treaty.
Flora folds into Fauna,
The scent, the song,
The critter crawling in the curled earth.
To dissolve into the soil,
Spread as leaf-buds, blossom
Into plumes of petals and sighs—
Here, on crushed violets, we stand,
Eager to greet the burst
Of Rainbow's arching of light,
Come bathe us with color,
Fill the air with our laughter,
In this world where we breathe,
Birds cicadaed the color back,
To where scented whispers come alive.

- Mina Loy
