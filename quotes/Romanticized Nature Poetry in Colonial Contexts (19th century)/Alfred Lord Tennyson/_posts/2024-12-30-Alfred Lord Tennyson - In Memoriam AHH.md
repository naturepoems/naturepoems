In Memoriam A.H.H.
I hold it true, whate'er befall;
   I feel it, when I sorrow most;
   'Tis better to have loved and lost
   Than never to have loved at all.

In this hi-tech world of ours,
   In the heart's mysterious isle,
   I seek the thing of nature's grace,
   The poetry of every mile.

All things go on: Time's vagrant art,
   Flows on and on, through endless space;
   Each sigh, each heart, each sending heart
   In nature's care must find its place.

And when the day is done and gone,
   And night enfolds what day has fled,
   I walk the paths where you have gone,
   And listen where your heart has bled.

For sweetly in the woods I hear
   The echo of your loss resound;
   And though, to lose is hard, my dear,
   In all that pain, a beauty's found.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
