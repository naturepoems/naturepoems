Of Mere Being

The palm stands on the edge of space,
The Palm stands on the edge of Space,
The palm stands on the edge of Space.

The palm stands; its leathery leaves
Bear a white flower that is
A tree’s beloved ornament.

In the distance, the palm in its
Groove moves faster than all the stars; 
They are the tokens of light,
1bs thence remain.

The sun, now hot, in height’s deeps,
Touching the palm, recalls what must be:
Its stillness is the image today.

A creature of all, bearing mid-air,
A sign of creation, under no shadow
But that of itself, and a cry,
Continuing to pass in the vast of Space.


- Wallace Stevens
