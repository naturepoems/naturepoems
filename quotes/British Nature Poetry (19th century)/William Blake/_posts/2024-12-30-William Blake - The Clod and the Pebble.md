Songs of Innocence and of Experience: The Clod and the Pebble

Love seeketh not itself to please,  
Nor for itself hath any care;  
But for another gives its ease,  
And builds a Heaven in Hell’s despair.  

So sang a little Clod of Clay,  
Trodden with the cattle's feet:  
But a Pebble of the brook  
Warbled out these meters meet:  

Love seeketh only Self to please,  
To bind another to its delight;  
Joys in another’s loss of ease,  
And builds a Hell in Heaven’s despite.

- William Blake
