The Forest

Within the ancient wood I walk,  
And hear the silence speak to me;  
Among the trees where shadows stalk,  
The whispers dance as wild and free.

Each branch and leaf hath stories told,  
Of life that flourished in the sun;  
In shaded paths where dreams unfold,  
I find my heart again begun.

The squirrel leaps, the heartbeat stays,  
As nature wraps me in her grace;  
With every step, in soft malaise,  
The forest holds me in its embrace.

- John Davies
