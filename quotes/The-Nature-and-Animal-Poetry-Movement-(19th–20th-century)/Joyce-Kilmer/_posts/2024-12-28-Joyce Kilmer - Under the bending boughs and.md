Under the bending boughs and branches,
Time slips away like quiet streams;
The yearning heart so dearly chances
Awakens hope in tender dreams.

The quiet sun and dreaming shadows,
The meadows whisper deep and true;
They beckon through enchanted glades,
The stranger knows not where to move.

- Joyce Kilmer
