Sunday Morning
Complacencies of the peignoir, and late
Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair,
And the palm stands on the edge of the world.

In the palm, the wildness sleeps, half-awake,
In the sun-flowers of heaven.  The thought.
And the nature of the world â€” so strangely made,
Merges with the pulse of the moment, a sound.

The world would be a more complete place,
If we knew the meaning of the body and spirit, 
The making of that mind as it is, and is
An epoch for an altered meaning in the wails.

- Wallace Stevens
