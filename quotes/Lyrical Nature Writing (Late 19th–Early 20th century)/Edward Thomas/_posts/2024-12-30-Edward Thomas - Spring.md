Spring

O, spring, that comes as life renews,
With blooms that burst upon the scene,
The earth adorned in diamond dew,
In every shade of vivacious green.

The birds calling forth their songs of glee,
In jubilation, life begins anew,
As blossoms smile, as if to flee,
And I, with them, find joy so true.


- Edward Thomas
