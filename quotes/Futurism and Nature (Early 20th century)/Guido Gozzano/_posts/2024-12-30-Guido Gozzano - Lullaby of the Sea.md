The sea sings a lullaby  
That ripples on the burning sands,  
Where footsteps vanish in the foam,  
And horizons blend with infinite dreams -  
Mouths of clay, the legends rise,  
Of mariners lost in the embrace  
Of waves that cradle,  
Softly they become the whispers  
Of ancient peoples.

- Guido Gozzano
