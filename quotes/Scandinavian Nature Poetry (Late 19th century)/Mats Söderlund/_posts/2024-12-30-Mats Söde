Wilderness calls with a tender voice,
In meadows wide and forests deep,
Each rustle stirs the heart to rejoice,
Awakening dreams that never sleep.

In echoes of life, a sweet refrain,
Through seasons' dance and cycles’ spin,
Nature’s wisdom, like sun and rain,
In endless rhyme, we find our kin.


- Mats Söderlund
