Out, Out—
The buzz-saw snarled and rattled in the yard
And made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood,
Sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it.

Distant, the four- faced head of a man
Working with a saw that cut the unshapely lot.
Two saws that lived, and hardly knew they worked.
What seemed a miracle was a little boy's hand.
And every day the sun went down with dusk.

- Robert Frost
