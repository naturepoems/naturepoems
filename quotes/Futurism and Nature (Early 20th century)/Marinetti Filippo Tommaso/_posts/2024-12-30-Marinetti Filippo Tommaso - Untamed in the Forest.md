Untamed in the Forest
Following the howl of silver winds  
that have turned to feathers,  
I plunge headlong into the unknown,  
a beast unbridled  
searching for my anarchy!

The trees become  
wild archives of all that breathes,
skewering my ego in their boughs.

Violet ruptures,  
fissures of tamed shadows,  
fill the specter of clamoring myths!

Oh, forest!  
take my head,  
a bootstrap of time,  
landing upon strong limbs,  
learn from loveliness and horror!

I rise and retrieve  
the wildness in letters!

- Marinetti Filippo Tommaso
