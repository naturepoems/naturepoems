The prairie is wide,
Nomads roam and search
For the tall grasses
And the rivers that wander,

Where the buffalo stampede
And the shadows of clouds
Are ever-changing,
Always bringing
New skies above the endless.

There, the sun rises high,
And the dark earth heats,
Where the footsteps of the past
Are ever near to the pulse,
Of all life in the cycle.

- Carl Sandburg
