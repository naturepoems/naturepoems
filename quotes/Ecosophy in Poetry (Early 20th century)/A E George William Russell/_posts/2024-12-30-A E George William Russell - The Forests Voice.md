The Forest's Voice

The forest speaks in shadows,  
In the language of sighs and tears,  
In the gentle lapping waters  
And the music of the years.  
It holds the tales of the ancients,  
Whispered soft in the leaves,  
Songs of time and beauty  
And the heart that ever believes.

- A E George William Russell
