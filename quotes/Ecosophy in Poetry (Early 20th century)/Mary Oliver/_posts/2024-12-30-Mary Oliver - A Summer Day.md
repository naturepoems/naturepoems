A Summer Day

In the heart of the summer  
     the shadows grow longer  
     and the days stretch like  
     a cat in the warm sun.  
     Everything speaks,  
     everything sings—  
     the goldfinches wheel in the sky,  
     flutter and flash,  
     and the sun spills  
     in hot fingers over the land.  
     This is the season  
     of open windows,  
     of laughter  
     that carries in sweetly,  
     of remembering, of loving,  
     of being still—  
     a day  
     made for dreaming.

- Mary Oliver
