The echoing cries of tenant birds  
Resound through forest trees;  
Their songs can soothe with endless words  
In whispered melodies.  

Yet in the shade of dappled light,  
The shadows chase the sun;  
And time drifts on with day and night,  
Until this song is done.  

So let my heart grow calm and wild  
As nature turns her page;  
In every note, a dream beguiled,  
Reveals the golden age.

- Joyce Kilmer
