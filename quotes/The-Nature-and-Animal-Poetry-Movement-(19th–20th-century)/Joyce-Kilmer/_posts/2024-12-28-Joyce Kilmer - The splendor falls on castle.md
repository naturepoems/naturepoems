The splendor falls on castle walls,
And snowy summits old in story:
The long light breaks, and each bird wakes,
And frumious bandersnatch is singing.

Mountains arise and shadows play
Like welcome friends with lighted hearts:
Then thou and I shall pluck the way,
And”peace to all behind us”parts.

- Joyce Kilmer
