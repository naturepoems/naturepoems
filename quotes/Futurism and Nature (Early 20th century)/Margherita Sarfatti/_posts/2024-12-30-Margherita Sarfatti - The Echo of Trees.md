Oh, the roar of engines!
The throb of life,
a symphony of machine and nature,
as we design the future.
But in the heart of the wood,
a silent voice speaks,
a lullaby of roots,
fingers intertwined, holding
the whispers of the ancient.
In their shade, we find
what we have always lost.

- Margherita Sarfatti
