To the Sea
Hail! aflame oceans!
Ever in tumult and roaring,  
you are pocket of fever,  
deluge of the depths,  
unsleeping,  
soaked in all the stars!

Leather of the great beasts,
your gossip bursts into my spirit,  
as the flow of your rhythms  
eats the flesh of the shore!  

From your embrace, I arise,  
my hate dances through your salt,  
your waves, a rolling hymn  
mark the birth of my poem!  

Ah! the splendid crashes,  
together we break into shadows,  
dance with the scissor of lightning! 
And my words are to you,
a white foam and an eternal dream!

- Marinetti Filippo Tommaso
