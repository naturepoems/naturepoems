The Masque of Anarchy

I

The wind is free;
And are not we
And they and she
To be fair! In life alive
When a voice sounds loud,
With the grave shades often glacial.
Beneath horizon straining down
With the soul beneath the sound;
Never choose the time or place,
For joy wears a smiling face,
And is a watchful gracious life.
Every cocoon's a flower,
That gives forth buds hour by hour;
O’er azure Baikal's deepest shades!

II

Silence as deep passes o’er;
Around there blossomed all above,
Every heart sings from within the see,
Let us rest from this sorrow and strife;
In glowing bloom, there springs in me
But the tender light of love.
In that light I did see plainly,
And your voice, love, cried above,
And your heart—ours beats but slowly.

Oh to see how her beauty gleams—
I dreamed of love beneath the moon!

- Percy Bysshe Shelley
