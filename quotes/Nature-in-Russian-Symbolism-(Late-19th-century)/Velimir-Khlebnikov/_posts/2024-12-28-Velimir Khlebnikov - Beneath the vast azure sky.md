Beneath the vast, azure sky,  
fields are brushstrokes, art divine,  
woven into the fabric of time,  
where natureâ€™s hands create and bind.  

The whispers of the grass  
and the sighs of the trees,  
a language understood by few,  
reminding us, to listen well,  
for in every silence lies a truth,  
a pulse of the earth,  
a heartbeat of the living.

- Velimir Khlebnikov
