Ode to the Wind

How the wind stirs,
In joy and in wrath!
Tales it whispers from worlds
That linger on its path,
Caressing the cliffs,
Churning rivers in flight,
It plays with the leaves
And spins them in delight.

Shattering silence,
In gusts and twirls,
Echoes of laughter
Among all the swirls.
Carry me on your back,
Oh wind, wild and free,
Where storm clouds gather—
Nature’s own decree.


- Richard Huelsenbeck
