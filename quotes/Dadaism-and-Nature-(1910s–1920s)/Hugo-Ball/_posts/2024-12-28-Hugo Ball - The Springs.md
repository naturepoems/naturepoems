The Spring’s Breath

Awakening from winter's lull,
The world shivers and stirs,
Bud by bud, a soft explosion,
Of colors snatched from dreams,
Petals flapping like thankful hands,
In the symphony of reawakening.

The sweet scent fills the air,
Where honeybees work in concert,
Cascading through blooms of joy,
Telling tales of life renewed,
Frogs croak the rhythm of love,
And the robin sings freedom’s wish.


- Hugo Ball
