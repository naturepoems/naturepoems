The vibrant sky at dusk descends,
With hues of crimson as daylight ends.
Stars awaken in twilight's embrace,
A cosmic dance, the infinite space.

The nightingale calls from the deep dark woods,
Echoing softly through the quiet moods.
Serenity whispers in the starlit night,
Nature's poetry shines ever bright.

- Mariano Fortuny
