quote: "Among the ferns, a bright blue butterfly,  
Flutters as if the air were made of dreams,  
And the light spills like honey upon the earth,  
Marking time with gentle strokes of color,  
Nature’s brush painting a fleeting moment."

Among the ferns, a bright blue butterfly,  
Flutters as if the air were made of dreams,  
And the light spills like honey upon the earth,  
Marking time with gentle strokes of color,  
Nature’s brush painting a fleeting moment.
