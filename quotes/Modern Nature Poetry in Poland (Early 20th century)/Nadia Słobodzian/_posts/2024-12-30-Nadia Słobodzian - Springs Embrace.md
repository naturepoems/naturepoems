Beneath the swaying boughs  
where light dips and dives,  
daisies bloom—a sea of white,  
cupping the sun’s warmth,  
a canvas painted gently  
by the tenderness of spring.  

Butterflies flutter,  
a dance sealed in quiet air,  
the world breathing softly,  
every pulse in bloom.

- Nadia Słobodzian
