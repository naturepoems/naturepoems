Beneath the oak that bends so wide,  
Where the fawns and wild things hide,  
Come hither, love, with tender grace,  
In the woods, letâ€™s find our place.  
Whispers round us, soft and deep,  
In this dream where hearts will leap.

For the beat of nature sings  
In the joy that love brings;  
Each moment sweetened, pure and bright,  
In the arms of soft twilight.

- Sir Philip Sidney
