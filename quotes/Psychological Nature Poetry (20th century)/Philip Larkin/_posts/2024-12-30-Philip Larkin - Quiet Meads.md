From quiet meads to rushing streams,
In every path, the spirit seems.
A tapestry of life unfurled,
Within the heart, the love is swirled.
        
The trees hold witness to the years,
While branches catch our hopes and fears.
In springtime’s bloom or autumn’s rust,
Nature reminds us in her trust.
        
Hold dear the moments, light will gleam,
In nature’s arms, we find our dream.
Hearts intertwined in grace and creed,
Among the living, we are freed.

- Philip Larkin
