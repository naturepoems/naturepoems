When wild War’s deadly blast was blowin’,
And soldiers’ blood in rivers flowin’,
When death and night the battle’s showin’,
In bloody red broad stripes is sewn.

It’s Celtic blood that knows no fear,
It’s liberty the truth sincere;
It’s the proud bond that brought us here;
To let the daylight break anew, my dear. 

So lift the glass, and drink the draught,
Speak what your heart’s desire has thought;
For let me love, and let me sing,
With the strength of hope and faith I’ll bring.

- Robert Burns
