---

Give me the splendid, silent sun,  
  With all his beams full-bleeding,  
He shall be my light from afar,  
  As I wander amongst the trees.  

I feel in all things the flow of light,  
  I am one with the shining stars—  
And all the nights that grace the world  
  With rich velvet darkness,  
I hold sacred, my voices raised wide.  


- Walt Whitman
