Ocean waves pulse,
a heartbeat of a thousand shores,
as sand cradles footprints,
time dissolving with each swell,
a tapestry where salt and sun meet.

Every crest brings stories,
every fall, a letting go,
underneath the horizon's grasp,
where the sky kisses the sea,
I find a piece of myself
in the wavesâ€™ rhythm.

- Margherita Guidacci
