Whirlwinds spin
In the laughter of orchards,
Fruit ripens in the harmony
Of sunlight's gentle probe.
The earth sighs mortal breath,
Round and robed by the cloak of time—
I reside in the whisper of petals
As fireflies drape their lumens,
Whirling around laughter and sighs,
Oh how the tender moss grows,
Among the ancients it sings of life,
And a lilting swell takes us beyond
The essence of what we hope to know—
In nature’s cradle, we shall.


- Mina Loy
