The Ice-Gatherers

In icy twilight stole,
The Ice-gatherers come,
With iron pike and steady hand.
They fracture all the shiny calm,
With voice and laughter; till the loom
Of silence rends as under flame,
The glassy surface, and the sparkling foam.
They pick the sharp pure splinters,
From trapped air in the ice,
A pale blue glow glimmers,
In their busy, callous hands,
Like a hapless heart, a silent grave, 
They take and take;
From frost to fire, from fire to mist,
Through this endless cycle of a night.

Now lift your body, O tired crowd;
Above that sky, apathetic stars,
This vivid world bespeaks our dreams,
Of boundless life, far away, obscured.

In the bitter silence linger, 
With breath held tight, unspoken dreams await.


- Valery Briussov
