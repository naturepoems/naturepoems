Sea Rose

Amid the sand-dunes low
      In the sea's wordless symphony,
      Its voice in the potency of the rose,
A pale sea rose with a
  Tattered and torn lease,
      Its petals washed thin,
Its perfume drawn from the sea's own limits.
It seems ashamed of its origins,
      Its strength comes from the tempest,
A spurned flower-in-the-wind,
Seeking to be touched by the sun.
 
Yet here it stands, by the shore
    Unexpectedly placed,
Windswept brittle yet determined,
In its fragile unadorned beauty.


â€” H.D. (Hilda Doolittle)
