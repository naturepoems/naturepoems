The River

All night upon the river, alone and sad,
My heart is like a stone beneath the cold;
The waters pass so swiftly, and yet they are
Where I have passed and left my heart untold.

The moon doth cast a glimmer on the flow,
And rippling dreams come stealing on the tide;
The whispers of the water softly say
Of every thing I’ve lost—from thee—my bride.

- Robert Buchanan
