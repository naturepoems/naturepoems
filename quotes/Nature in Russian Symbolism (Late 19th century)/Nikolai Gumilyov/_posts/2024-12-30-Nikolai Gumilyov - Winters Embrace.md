Winter's Embrace

When winter steals the warmth away,
And blankets earth in snow so white,
The world transforms, in stark array,
In silence deep, the stars shine bright.

Each flake like dreams that gently falls,
To cover all in purest form,
As nature whispers, softly calls,
In icy breaths, the night grows warm.

The trees, adorned with crystal lace,
Stand tall beneath the moon's soft glow,
In this enchanted, frozen space,
The spirit finds its quiet flow.

Oh winter’s embrace, so cold, so dear,
In your stillness, I find my home,
For in the chill, my heart draws near,
To nature's arms, no need to roam.

– Nikolai Gumilyov
