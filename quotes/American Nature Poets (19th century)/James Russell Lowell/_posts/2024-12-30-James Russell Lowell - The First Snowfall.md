The First Snowfall

The first snow-fall of winter,
  When in the woods we roam,
The trees are bending, so quiet,
  And the leaves drift softly home.
The sky is heavy and gray,
  But the world is pure and brightâ€”
The flakes come down like angels,
  And fill the heart with light.

O soft white peace of winter,
  When and where dan the last
Thaw of my heart come on to feel
  The warmth of seasons past.
Let us enjoy this white wonder,
  And grasp the fleeting hours,
For soon the bright sun will melt us
  Beneath his summer showers.

- James Russell Lowell
