I think I should like to subscribe  
                      To a star,  
                       For the sake of its light,  
                      Brought here to my heart.

                      Oh, I would put a star  
                     In my pocket,  
                 Where it is so bright,  
                 And fold it tight,

                       To watch it burn  
                      The shining bright,  
                      Constant and supine  
                       And clear in the night.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
