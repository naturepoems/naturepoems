Whispers of the Wind
Listen to the whispers of the wind,
As they dance upon the leaves again;
Carrying tales from far and wide,
Of love, and loss, the ebbing tide.

Through the branches, soft and clear,
It calls to hearts that yearn to hear,
The songs of ages lost in time,
Each note a sacred pantomime.

Oh, let me wander where you lead,
Where nature blooms and spirits heed,
For in your flow, I find my peace,
A timeless rhythm that shall never cease.

The winds of change may come and go,
But through these whispers, I still know,
In every breath, you draw me near,
This symphony of earth, I hold dear.

- J C R Selwyn
