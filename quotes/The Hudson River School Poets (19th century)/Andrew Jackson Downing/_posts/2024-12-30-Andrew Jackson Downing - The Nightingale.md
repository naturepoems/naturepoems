The Nightingale
A nightingale sings in the evening's embrace,
Her notes like pearls in the stillness fall,
Through the moonlit trees, she weaves her lace,
A melody cherished, a sweet evening call.
In the hush of the night, her voice takes flight,
A serenade to dreams that dance through the night.

- Andrew Jackson Downing
