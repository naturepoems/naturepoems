The Pool

   v
yet the pool
purring with stars,
silently flowers,
dreaming shadows
    of dappled presence:
        springs the serpent’s eye
        takes the dark among the day—
    look you all now on me!

the sibilance,
like a trooping tiger
    leaps not a space,
    but in the clear dawn
    is rolled up
    and secret.
                  —H.D.
