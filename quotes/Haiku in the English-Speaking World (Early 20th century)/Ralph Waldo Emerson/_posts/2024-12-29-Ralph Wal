The Thought
  Nature gives, but does not lend,
  It offers space for joy unspent,
  The thought alone, from mind to mind,
  Becomes the seed in every blend.
  For in each breath of leafy shadow,
  This one exists, this too will show,
  Beneath our steps the dreamers grow,
  For natureâ€™s hand is gently slow.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
