A Dream of Death
A man came from the west, the heather was in his heart.
His call was like the wind among the leaves.
The day was falling and the blue sky dying.
He came and stood before me and he seemed to shine through
Like light that falls through hollows in the leaves.

Now I am lost in dreams of you,
A dream as fresh as dew,
And like the morning sun may break,
So may you break my heart in two.

- William Butler Yeats
