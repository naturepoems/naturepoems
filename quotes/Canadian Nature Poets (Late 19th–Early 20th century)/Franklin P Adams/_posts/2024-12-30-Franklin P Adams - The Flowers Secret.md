The Flower's Secret

What secrets does the flower hold,
In petals soft and colors bold,
A story whispered on the air,
Of sunlit days and gentle care.

Each bloom a treasure, life’s delight,
A canvas painted with the light,
In every garden, hope is sown,
And from the earth, a beauty grown.


- Franklin P Adams
