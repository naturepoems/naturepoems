The sky is blue, the sun is bright,  
The fields are waving green and gold,  
While out beyond the tree-clad heights  
The sunset glows, a sight to behold.

All nature sings in joyous song,  
And I, a humble soul, belong  
To her embrace, her sweet repose,  
In every petal, leaf, and rose.

- Hjalmar Hegner
