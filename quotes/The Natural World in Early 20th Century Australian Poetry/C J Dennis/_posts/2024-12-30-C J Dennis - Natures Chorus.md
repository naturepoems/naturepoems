The hills are a chorus, the valleys a choir,
And the rivers are singing, their melodies higher,
While the gum trees stand sentry, with their leaves in a sway,
As they stretch to the clouds, to the blue of the day.

The lilies are laughing in the ripples that play,
All the life of the landscape, so vivid and gay;
O sweet hour of wonder, where the heart may see clear,
In the beauty of nature, let the soul disappear.


- C J Dennis
