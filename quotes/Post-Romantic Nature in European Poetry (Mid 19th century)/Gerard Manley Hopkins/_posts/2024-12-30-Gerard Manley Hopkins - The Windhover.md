The Windhover

To Christ our Lord

I caught this morning morning’s minion, king-
  dom of daylight’s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding
  Of the rolling level underneath him steady, on wings across the wind
  Like a rolling stone, hungry for the air.

And we may sing the praise of the synod—
  Just so do I, of the glory of God!

I, but like an arrow, high-flying, soaring through the sky:
  This bird, heaven-blessed in its flight, be there on high.

All things that are are so beautifully made.
  A body; a mountain; a wave through the love.
  He is the king of daylight, the king of hearts!
  Bulging, arching, like flanks would fly the feel of death.


- Gerard Manley Hopkins
