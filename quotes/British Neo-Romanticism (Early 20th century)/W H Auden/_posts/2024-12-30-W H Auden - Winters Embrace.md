The winter night, a canvas white,
Where snowflakes dance in crisp delight;
Each flake, unique, reflects the stars,
In silent nights, no haste, no bars.

The crackling fire, the warmth it brings,
The solace found in simple things;
In nature's chill, our hearts ignite,
As nature wraps us in her light.


- W H Auden
