The Soul should always stand ajar,  
That if the Heaven inquire,  
He will not see the Heart  
That way –  

He’s shone upon the Earth –  
And colors – knew my Poet’s Eye.  
By Chance, one Cone to rattle –  
For creatures – I a Sigh.  

And Nature could be stifled –  
To breathe –  
To listen – yet to lose  
Again and again to the door –  

The sudden rapping Tides  
Would cease,  
And silence on the Sea  
To meet me there on that Shore –

- Emily Dickinson
