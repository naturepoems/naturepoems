The tree in my garden is full of flowers,
And the fragrance of life is thick and sweet,
For the sky is blue over head,
And the sun lies warm in the bed.
The moon rides bright through the night
And the stars twinkle in delight  
For the earth belongs to the flowers,  
As the poet belongs to his song.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
