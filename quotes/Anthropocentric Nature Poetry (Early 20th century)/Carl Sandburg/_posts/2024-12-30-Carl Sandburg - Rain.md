The rain is a part of the shadows,  
    touching our skin, seeping into our hearts,  
As we walk through the whispering trees,  
    thick with the firefliesâ€™ glow.  
Each drop of rain is a note  
     in the symphony of silence,  
Filling the world with stories  
    known only to the night.

- Carl Sandburg
