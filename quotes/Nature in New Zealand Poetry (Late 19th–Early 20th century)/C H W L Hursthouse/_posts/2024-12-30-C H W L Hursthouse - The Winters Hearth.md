The Winter's Hearth

As winter wraps the earth in white,
A blanket warm, an ancient sight.
The fires we light, the stories shared,
In cozy nooks, we’re gently bared.

The snowflakes fall, a silent cheer,
Each flake unique, a whisper clear.
The chill outside, a world at rest,
And in our hearts, we feel the blessed.

So gather close around the flame,
In winter’s grasp, there’s naught to blame.
For in this cold, we find our grace,
In warmth of love’s eternal embrace.
