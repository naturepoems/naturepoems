In the spirit of twilight,
       where shadows gather,
       I found the echo of your laughter
           tracing over the hills,
        threading through the pines,
 
     a gentle whisper, the moon
          and I exchange glances,
            as you rest on the surface
ofthe water, a fleeting silver,
                inviting the night’s embrace.

- Philip Lamantia
