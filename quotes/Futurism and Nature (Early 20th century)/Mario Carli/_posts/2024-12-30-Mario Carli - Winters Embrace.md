Winter's Embrace
Beneath the blanket of snow,
Nature sleeps,
Silent and still,
Crystals dance on branches,
A glistening crown,
While the world slows,
In a hushed reverence,
Winter whispers secrets,
Of rest and renewal,
The chill biting,
Yet somehow warm,
A time of reflection,
As frosty air carries dreams,
Where warmth lingers,
In the heart's quiet corners,
Until the thaw wakes
The earth from its slumber.


- Mario Carli
