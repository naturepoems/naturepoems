In the twilight when every whispering wing,
Calls softly from the boughs,
The birds speak secrets to the evening,
Caressed by the fading vows.
The night engulfs their songs of light,
Wrapped in the dusky embrace,
Natureâ€™s lullaby drifts through the night,
As dreams cast their tender grace.

- Maurice Maeterlinck
