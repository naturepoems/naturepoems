Stars twinkle through the canopy,  
a blanket of diamonds,  
held tight by the velvet night.  
Crickets sing soft lullabies,  
a chorus rising from the grass,  
a reminder that darkness  
holds its own light.  
The moon spills silver  
over the hills and creeks,  
casting shadows that dance,  
wrapping the world in dreams  
and sleepâ€™s gentle embrace.  
Under this celestial vault,  
we are all children,  
dreaming beneath the heavens,  
where the universe hums  
its ancient song.
