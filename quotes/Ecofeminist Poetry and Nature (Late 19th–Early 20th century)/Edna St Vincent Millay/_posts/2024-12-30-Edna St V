An Ancient Gesture

The moment you’re mother’s call  
  Woe to the eye and sight!  
The chubby raindrops fall—  
  Cold the lakes and night—  
Among the bridge will swell,  
  That sway of hidden hair,  
Close my eyes and ring my bell;  
  To breathe sweet skies with care.  
Oh better let heaven’s songs be poured,  
  Let all that share believe—  
As time begins but there implored—  
  Blessed were that night shall cleave.  
While each embrace, so timid sparks,  
  Who shows not whispers render,  
Yet nature’s heart doth clear her marks —  
  And I craft yet remain tender!  
  

- Edna St Vincent Millay
