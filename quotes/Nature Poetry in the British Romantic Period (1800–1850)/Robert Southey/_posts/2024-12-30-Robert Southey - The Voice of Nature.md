How blest the years when Nature speaks,
With all her beauty that awakes,
The threads of Life, her course unique,
Binding the heart while silence breaks.
Her playful winds, the rustling leaves,
Are melodies that speak to me,
And all that Nature gives or leaves,
Is peace, and rest, sweet ecstasy.

-- Robert Southey, "The Voice of Nature"
