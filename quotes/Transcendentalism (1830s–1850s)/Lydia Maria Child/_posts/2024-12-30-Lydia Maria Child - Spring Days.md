SPRING DAYS

The spring days come with gentle grace,
To teach the heart again,
How sweetness hoards the promise fair,
That sunshine brings its gain.

The bud unfolds in softest light,
The dew-kissed leaves awake,
And every moment’s melody,
Turns dreams that none may break.

Oh praise the Lord with every breath,
As nature hums her song,
For in these spring days’ warm embrace,
The heart is free and strong!

- Lydia Maria Child
