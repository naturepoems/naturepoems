The Snow-Storm

Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,
Arrives the snow, and, inattentive, lies;
The starkest black of night on white—where I
See my own face, the country’s, stark as ice;
Sudden beauty glimmers on ungovern’d flaws.

Whose lights conceal the white that make me sigh,
Till all that made a sea from shores does die;
Yes, the land is barren now and a consummable char,
As branches crack broken on the flowered blade,
Yet beauty on beauty takes her leave and sighs.

The mystic stars’ eternal scores of hearts, —
Compares the snow; yet only does greet
This hour of dearth with careless ease.
For sorrow on embers rare debts me no dark flick,
Naught can destroy her light: the night defeats,
Wing-fling the heart where I first dare reach.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
