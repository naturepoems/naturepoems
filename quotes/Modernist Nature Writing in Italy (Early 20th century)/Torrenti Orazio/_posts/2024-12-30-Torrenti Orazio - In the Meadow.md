In the Meadow

Where wildflowers bloom in hues bright,
And butterflies flit in the air,
In the meadow's gentle embrace,
Nature unfurls, stripped bare.

Bees hum a tune, a lullaby sweet,
While grass sways in rhythm, soft and low,
Here, the heart can find its beat,
In the dance of life, the ebb and flow.

As sunlight streams through tangled vines,
Illuminating all that thrives,
I sit in stillness, time suspended,
In this pocket of beauty, my soul arrives.

- Torrenti Orazio
