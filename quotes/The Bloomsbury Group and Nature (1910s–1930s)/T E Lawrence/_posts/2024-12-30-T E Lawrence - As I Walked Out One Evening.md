As I walked out one evening
   Walking down Bristol Street,
   A crowd flowed over London Bridge,
   So many, I had never seen.

   From each slow, dragged-out face
   Within the crowd, I saw
   A multitude of happy fools
   And frowning sages, making laws.

   And I saw the Godless seen,
   Vagabonding like a rat.
   The trickles out the drain
   Mindlessly pulling it all back.

   Its hard work to find the truth
   As the laurel leaves come curling,
   In shadows beneath the stone;  
   Like joy, a law that’s never servile.
   
   And I watched the river flow,
   Taking minutes with its flow.
   Somewhere just beyond a cut,
   I saw summer begin to glow.

- T E Lawrence
