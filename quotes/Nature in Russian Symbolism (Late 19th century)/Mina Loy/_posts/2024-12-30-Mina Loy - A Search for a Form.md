A Search for a Form
My soul is not going
where you would make me go;
i would not live against the air,
which i adore.
Spring winds blow here
and tumble rhododendron
petals about me.
I shall not rise to the
bellicose song of the trees,
which i see always,
reigning above,
claiming planetâ€™s right, crowned.
The bees buzz how raw of land
for delicate flies, were that crown heavy.
I will wait for my flesh
and fullness, my own phenomena.
I will not be where you would
have me.

- Mina Loy
