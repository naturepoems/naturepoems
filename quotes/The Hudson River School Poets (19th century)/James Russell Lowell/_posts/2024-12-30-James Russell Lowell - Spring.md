Spring
  
When faded leaves are burst from dreams,
With joy proclaiming all the way,
Eve whispers gently through the beams,
Awaking souls to start the day.

The blooms to burst and all shall sing,
In passion’s light they stretch and sway,
As buds unfold in offering swings,
With fragrance filling all the day.

Where flowers from the ground arise,
And all the hidden buds take play,
Each moment in the springtime cries,
For nature’s wedding down to stay.

- James Russell Lowell
