In the midst of this crowded world,
Among all the calls and clamor,
I find a tree,
Standing alone,
Strong and silent.
It does not seek me nor curse my presence,
But softly reminds me,
Of quiet revelations,
That lift my spirit,
To the heavens above,
Among the stars that seem to hold
The secrets of our nature,  
In their twinkling embrace.

- Henry David Thoreau
