Autumn Song
The leaves are falling  
       One by one,  
And golden light  
       Shines in the sun.

The skies are dim  
       And the birds are few,  
The daylight wanes,  
       And the moon shines through.

In evening’s peace,  
       The shadows creep,  
And the stars begin  
       Their watch to keep.

The world is still  
       In the fading light,  
As day turns slowly  
       Into night.




- Robert Louis Stevenson
