The Woodspurge

A tree-pod, wrapped in velvet, brings
Rich, plenteous seeds on the snow-drop wings,
And the woodspurge beside me, daring to peer,
Seems to whisper a word of cheer.

You should know the woodspurge, bright-eyed and small,
Its flowers are rank with a sheeny wall.
Yet its dark leaves clustering, encircle that bloom,
And the scent of the wood is in echoing room.

My heart was heavy with burdened regret,
And where I wandered the foul weeds beset.
But the woodspurge come coming and taunting me sore,
Said, "In the same ground, there is ever more."


The Shadow of a Star

This Shadow of a Star that leans
Over the blossomed leaves and gleans
In secret birth its fairy spark
Through verdant tresses of the dark.
It settles softly down and lies
Over the land as fair as skies.
In whispers dew it clings so close,
As if to hear the nightingale's prose.

Yet life is lost in silent streams,
Where morning light disturbs your dreams.
Beneath the leaves, your shadows play,
And whisper serenely night and day.


The House of Life

The House of Life is a weed-choked place,
There the weed and the flower bloom face to face.
And when all shadows have started to rise,
The kingdom of Nature in tender guise.

Each evening shade, the branches twine,
Twisting sorrow and joy in the vine.
Behold, the leaves, the wildest song,
That calling you home will steer you along.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
