The River

A gentle stream, through the valleys wide,
Doth wander beneath the bending trees;
Where the flowers bloom on the fertile side,
And the winds hum soft their melodies.

With laughter it breaks upon the stone,
And gifts the earth with a soothing breath;
Rekindling tales of the days gone lone,
Through tranquil paths where it holds no death.

O river! Thy course is a sacred rhyme,
That whispers the secrets of the Earth,
In every ripple, a moment in time,
A trance of renewal, a gifted birth.

So let me trace thy ever-flowing face,
In Nature’s arms, get lost in thy grace.

—Felicia Hemans
