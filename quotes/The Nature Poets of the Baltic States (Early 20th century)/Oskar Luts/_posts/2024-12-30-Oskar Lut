In the heart of night, beneath the moon,  
The world awakens, in soft cocoon;  
Where dreams arise and gently flow,  
In natureâ€™s grasp, the heart does glow.

With every star, a wish ignites,  
A promise wrapped in velvet nights;  
For in this stillness, vast and deep,  
A sacred space, my soul shall keep.

- Oskar Luts
