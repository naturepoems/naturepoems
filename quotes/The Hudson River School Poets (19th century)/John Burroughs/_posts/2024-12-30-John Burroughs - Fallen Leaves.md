Fallen Leaves

The fallen leaves blanket the ground,
In shades of gold and burnt crimson red,
A tapestry woven, by nature’s hand found,
As they dance to the song of the seasons ahead.

With each gentle breeze, they flutter and sway,
An autumnal waltz, a soft farewell,
They whisper of summer in a fleeting display,
In their final embrace, there’s a story to tell.

And as I walk by, I pause to admire,
The beauty of life in this cycle so true,
For even in falling, there’s a spark of fire,
In the dance of the leaves, I find joy anew.

- John Burroughs
