Upon the hill where the wild grass sways,
And the sun spills gold on the gnarled oak,
I oft have lingered through soft summer days,
Listening to ancient stories, words unspoken.

The wind carries tales of the distant past,
Of lovers and warriors, of joy and ruin,
In each rustle of leaves, a memory cast,
In nature's lap, all sorrows are hewn.

Beneath the sky, so vast and blue,
I have sought refuge from life’s weary chase,
Find me among the shadows where the lilies strew,
In the gentle embrace of this sacred space.

For here, amidst the wild and untamed,
I rediscover the pulse of the earth’s own heart,
In the wilding whisper, I am named,
As nature and I shall never part.

- Willa Cather
