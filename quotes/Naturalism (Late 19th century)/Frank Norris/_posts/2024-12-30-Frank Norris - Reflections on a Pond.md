Reflections on a Pond  
Gaze upon the waters, a mirror so clear,  
Where the sky kisses earth, and the world draws near;  
The still pond reflects all, from the clouds to the trees,  
In a beautiful calm, that invites the soft breeze.
 
The lilies float gracefully, with colors ablaze,  
As the dragonflies dance through a delicate haze;  
The frogs give a chorus, their rhythm a tune,  
In the heart of this haven, under the watchful moon.
 
For in nature's reflections, we find our true core,  
A sense of connection, of love evermore;  
So sit by the pond, let your spirit take flight,  
In the silence, the world is perfectly right.

- Frank Norris
