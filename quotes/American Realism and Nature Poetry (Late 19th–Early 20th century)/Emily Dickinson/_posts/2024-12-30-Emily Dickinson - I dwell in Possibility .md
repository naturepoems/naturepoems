I dwell in Possibility –  
A fairer House than Prose –  
More numerous of Windows –  
Superior – for Doors –  

Of Chambers as the Cedars –  
Impregnable of Eye –  
And for an everlasting Roof  
The Gambrels of the Sky –  

The Cisterns hold their Dresser –  
The Fountains alternate –  
All Summer long the Cedar –  
And the Measles of the Snow –  

And though the World is just a field –  
The Sweets are growing too  
Into the Cedars – in the Air –  
The Infinity of you!  


- Emily Dickinson
