The Home of the Southern Cross
In the depths of the forest, where the wildflowers bloom,
Where the air breathes of freedom, and dusk evades gloom,
There the Southern Cross shines, ever bright in the night,
A symphony of stars, a heart's pure delight.
Oh, the home of the steadfast, the heart of the brave,
In the lap of the bush, where I wandered and save
All the moments of bliss, in the solace I found,
Underneath the vast canopy, peace ever profound.

- Henry Lawson
