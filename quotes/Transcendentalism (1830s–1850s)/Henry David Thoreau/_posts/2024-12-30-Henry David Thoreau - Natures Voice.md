What is that voice I hear so sweet,
Among the shades of leaf and bark?
It teases every dream and plea,
And calls me softly from the dark.

To lose myself in nature’s grace,
No chains shall bind this wandering heart,
In her embrace, I find my place,
For here, my spirit plays its part.

- Henry David Thoreau
