The Grasshopper 
O thou that dost certain abode keep, 
Under the outskirts of the fertile land, 
Take gentle friends and let a soft sigh leap 
From every heart and join in hand-in-hand. 
How it does sing so sweet upon my ear, 
And call me forth, in nature’s bloom alive! 
Let’s wander forth, find spir’git green so clear, 
To weave a path where lullabies abide.

- John Keats
