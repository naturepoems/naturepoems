The Sky

Above, the sky is a wondrous blue,
  Its beauty flings across the earth;
Each cloud that cuts , a soft white hue,
  Marks the fresh joy of heart and mirth.

The rays of sun that stream and play,
  Whisper sweet secrets to the trees;
And bid the flowers rise and sway,
  As happiness sings in the breeze.

- Isabella Valancy Crawford
