No lawless spring doth pass,

With birds a-flying, sun a-crying

In every wood and vale,

For love leads on through corresponding hours,

A train of sweet-eyed flowers.

And bloom where'er we set our feet,

In light and longing cool and sweet.

With childlike hearts to foam and roll,

As can calm night's heart like the flow of a soul!

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
