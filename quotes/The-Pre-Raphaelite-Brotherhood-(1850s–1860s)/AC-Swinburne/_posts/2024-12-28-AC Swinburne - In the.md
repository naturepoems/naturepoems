In the Desert
There comes a light upon the sunset dew,
With a soft kiss it shrivels the pearls bright,
And the gold that adorns the heavens so blue,
Fades like a wild song in the heart of night;
Yet there in the desert among the stones
Where the sculptured silence of dreams doth prevail,
Whispers the deep winds with their tender tones.

And lo! the mirage hangs in the vale,
Waving like a lily from the fountains that flow,
To tie itself down as the moonlight gleams
On the dust of its beauty that feigns to glow.
