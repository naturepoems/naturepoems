To Nature

All that is yours above the hills,  
On the heart's threshold, finds a home—  
You lead forth the weary feet to wander,  
With your joy of conversations,  
And when the trees have gone,  
And gone the shadows,  
You become light.  
In your steps comes a beckoning—  
Where beyond the flowers you blow,  
And linger against time!

- Lesbia Harford
