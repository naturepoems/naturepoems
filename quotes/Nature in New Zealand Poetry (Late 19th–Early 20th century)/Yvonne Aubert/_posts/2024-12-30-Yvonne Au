Under the serene sky,
Where the stars brightly shine,
I feel the earth's heartbeat,
And its rhythm divine.

The night wraps around me,
In a lover's embrace,
Every moment a treasure,
In this timeless space.

Nature sings softly,
In a harmony sweet,
As I breathe in the magic,
And let my heart beat.

- Yvonne Aubert
