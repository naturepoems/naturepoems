Out in the Woods

                  Out in the woods today I found,
                  My heart was light and free, unbound.
                  The trees did speak, in verdant tongues,
                  Singing sweetly of the young.
                  
                  Life pours in through leaves like sun,
                  The pulsing birds, and the river's run,
                  I lose myself in this embrace,
                  Nature, art, and vivid grace.
                  
                  Time slips, yet here I long to stay,
                  In meadow fields and late of day,
                  So take my thoughts, and let them soar,
                  Out in the woods, I find once more.

- Ivor Gurney
