Thou endless sky, so vast and pure,
Thy beauty fills my heart with peace,
In every cloud, a dream so sure,
In natureâ€™s arms, my worries cease.

Through every storm and radiant day,
Thy presence guides my weary soul,
In thee, my heart shall always stay,
In perfect balance, I am whole.

- Alfred Tennyson
