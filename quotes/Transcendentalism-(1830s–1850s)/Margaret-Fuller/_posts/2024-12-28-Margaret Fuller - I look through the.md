I look through the mist
Of the calm morning air,
Where the lilies bloom fair
And the soft wind does stir.

The canopies whisper 
Of stories untold,
Each leaf a memoir
Of the earth’s gentle fold.

The shadows are lingering,
But the sunlight will break,
Filling all the valleys
With warmth in its wake.

With faith in the springs,
And the love that we find,
In the wilderness wild,
We are loving, entwined.
— Margaret Fuller
