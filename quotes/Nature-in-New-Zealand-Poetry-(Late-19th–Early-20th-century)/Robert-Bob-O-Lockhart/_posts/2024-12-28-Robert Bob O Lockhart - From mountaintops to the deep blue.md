From mountaintops to the deep blue seas,
Nature’s grandeur brings us to our knees,
A symphony of life in delicate balance,
With every heartbeat, nature’s brilliance.

The lush green valleys, the rustling grass,
The fleeting clouds as the moments pass,
A tapestry woven with threads so fine,
In the heart of nature, our souls entwine.

- Robert Bob O Lockhart
