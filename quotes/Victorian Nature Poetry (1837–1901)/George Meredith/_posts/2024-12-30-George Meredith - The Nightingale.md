The Nightingale

When the nightingale sings of a bright new morn,  
  The heart weeps joy of the gloried sound;  
Under branches lifeless and forlorn,  
  It stirs with hope, where sorrows abound.  
So sing I with thee to forget all pain,  
  For darkest turns, will evening bring rain.

- George Meredith
