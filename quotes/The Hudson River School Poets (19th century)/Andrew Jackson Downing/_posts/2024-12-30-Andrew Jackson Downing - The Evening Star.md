The Evening Star
As twilight descends with a starry refrain,
The evening star twinkles, a guide from afar,
Through the hush of the night, wisdom reclaimed,
A gentle reminder, loveâ€™s guiding star.
In the quietude where whispers abide,
The universe spins, and dreams are our guide.

- Andrew Jackson Downing
