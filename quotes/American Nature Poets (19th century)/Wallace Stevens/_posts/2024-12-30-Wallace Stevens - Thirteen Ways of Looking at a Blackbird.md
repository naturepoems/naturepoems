Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird

I
Among twenty snowy mountains,
   The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.

II
I sat alone in the bare, white morning
   On the window ledge,
And looking out at the snowy mountains,
   I saw the blackbird
     [Unseen]
Move some evergreen boughs.

III
In the cold, white morning,
   A blackbird flew
Between snowflakes and low, invisible,
   Paths of air.

IV
It was evening all afternoon
   It was snowing
And the blackbird
   Whistled its real song.

V
The blackbird
   Is an embodiment of beauty,
Its song, the only music.
   I saw the blackbird
     [Unseen]
Move some evergreen boughs.

VI
The blackbird was not alone at all.
   This is what I saw:
An eye, and a blur of wings,
     [Unseen]
The mountains, still and majestic.

VII
I made an image of the mountains,
   And the air,
I had forgotten.
   Then the blackbird
     [Unseen]
Moved some evergreen boughs.

VIII
I sit among the mountains,
   I draw a breath,
I feel its air surround me,
   And it whistles near.

IX
With the snow,
   The blackbird's song,
An everlasting melody,
   Whistles near.

X
In the snow,
   The black bird,
Its dominion,
   The essence of the mountains.

XI
And once again:
   I sit among the hills
And watch the blackbird soar,
   Unseen,
Above the mountains.

XII
The eye is beautiful,
   The essence to each bird,
The only thing moving,
   Against the stillness.

XIII
I saw a blackbird,
   Witnessing the beauty
to the mountains and the trees,
   As I absorbed its song.
