The Paper Nautilus
O ligaments  
Of Nature, parched inside  
Dories  
Of sea foam and  
Wild squids—  
The moon  
And the tide of this day  
Repeatedly recognizes.

She is the combining element,  
Lingering and slow,  
Filming the bright arcs  
Of allusions—  
Only for the creatures living,  
To show them a way beyond.

Under water, under thought,  
From the dainty arms of light she lives,  
Fading into fair currents, blindsiding  
Conventional forms of beauty.


- Marianne Moore
