A tranquil lake, a mirror clear,
Reflects the clouds, the sky’s embrace,
With every ripple, peace draws near,
In nature’s arms, we find our place.

As twilight falls, the world is hushed,
The stars emerge like lanterns bright,
In nature’s glow, our spirits rushed,
To celebrate the sheer delight.


- Rudolph Rudy H Dalrymple
