A Jelly Fish

Jellyfishes float disconcertingly,
A body unbound, frail and laced,
With tendril arms that dance,
Beneath the surface; their innards,
Pulled by the tides, the light, the flowing waters,
Each curve a mystic wonder, a curious spell;
In their ethereal, translucent forms,
They weave tales and wander wide.


- Marianne Moore
