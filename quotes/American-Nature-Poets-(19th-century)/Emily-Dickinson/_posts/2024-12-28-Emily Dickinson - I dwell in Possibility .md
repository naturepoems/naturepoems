I dwell in Possibility –  
A fairer House than Prose –  
More numerous of Windows –  
Superior – for Doors –  

Of Chambers as the Cedars –  
Impregnable of Eye –  
And simply Wonderful –  
To see – is all I know –  

And as I walk the Tower –  
I know I'll find the Room –  
Where each thought is written,  
And Nature,** the all-consuming,  
That whispers through the leaves. –  

In my dwelling I shall find  
The brave and wild of Nature –  
Emerging like sweet Dreams,  
Half realized – The perfect Souvenir.  


- Emily Dickinson
