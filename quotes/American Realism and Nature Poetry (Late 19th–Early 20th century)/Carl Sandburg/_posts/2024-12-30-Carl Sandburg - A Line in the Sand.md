A Line in the Sand

I have a vision of fog and storm
Taking possession of the sea,
And in the distance,
A ship is coming in.
It knows no quiet,
It expects an anchor, a place to rest.
I see the grain on the ground,
And in winter's times,
All the trees are bare
And the ships will not sing.
Only the chill of the wind
Remains: a line in the sand.

- Carl Sandburg
