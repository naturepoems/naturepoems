The Death of an Infant

The gentle breezes sigh no more,
The flowers droop in woeful show;

And Nature weeps upon the shore-
From tears this little one shall grow.

In fragrant bloom, a life's embrace,
Though brief, a spirit pure and bright;

To dwell above in heaven's grace,
And bless the world with softest light.


- Philip Freneau
