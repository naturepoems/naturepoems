Underneath the swaying palms,
Where the soft breeze carries psalms,
The whispers of the ocean’s tune,
Bathe in the light of the golden moon.

Each tide that rolls against the land,
A dance of water, a gentle hand,
In the heart of nature, find your way,
Let the beauty of the moment stay.

- Robert Bob O Lockhart
