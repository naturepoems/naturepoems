M'illudo

         I dream,
         In a sea of shadows,
         That the voice of the sea,  
         Endless and serene,  
         Will echo over the human clamor.
         I await the morning winds,
         Tender, and hopeful,  
         Whispering peace.  
        
         
        


- Giuseppe Ungaretti
