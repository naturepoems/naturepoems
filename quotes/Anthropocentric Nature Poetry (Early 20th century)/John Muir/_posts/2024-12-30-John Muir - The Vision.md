The Vision

I gaze upon a forest deep,
Where ancient spirits softly weep,
Each tree a story, every stone,
A testament to the unknown.

The emerald leaves in sunlight glow,
Wisdom hidden deep below,
Nature’s beauty moves the heart,
In every corner, there’s a part.

And in simplicity I find,
Nature’s voice, a song so kind,
Drawing forth each yearning soul,
To become again, a part, a whole.

- John Muir
