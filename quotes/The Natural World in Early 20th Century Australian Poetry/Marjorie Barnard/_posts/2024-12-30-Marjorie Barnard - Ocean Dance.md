On rugged cliffs where wild winds wail,
The ocean roars against the stone.
In vibrant hues, the sea we hail,
And feel the pulse of nature’s tone.

The waves, like dancers, leap and sway,
In rhythm with the moon’s command;
A timeless play that will not stay,
An endless art upon the sand.

- Marjorie Barnard
