A Voice

A voice comes from the wind  
that sings into the trees,  
or whistles softly through the reeds.  
Telling tales of an ancient,  
forgotten world, I lift my eyes  
up to the green, and wonder  
which girl of the past wandered away  
through the whispering grass?  
Which branch holds her laughter?  
I listen closely nowâ€”  
abiding in the miracle of the sea,  
in the need to be still  
while the waves race from the shore.

- Mary Oliver
