Cascading leaves in a vibrant blaze,
Autumn’s palette upon the ground;
A dance of color, a fleeting gaze,
Nature’s beauty, relentless and profound.

Each gust of wind, a whispered sigh,
Carrying dreams that once were bright;
In their falling, the trees reply,
To the heartbeat of the creeping night.

- Émile Zola
