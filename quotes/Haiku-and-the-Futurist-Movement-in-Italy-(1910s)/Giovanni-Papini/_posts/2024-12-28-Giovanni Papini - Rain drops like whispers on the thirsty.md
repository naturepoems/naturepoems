Each murmur a promise of life yet to come.
The earth drinks deep, wrapped in nature's sound,
And blossoms arise where silence was numb."

Rain drops like whispers on the thirsty ground,
Each murmur a promise of life yet to come.
The earth drinks deep, wrapped in nature's sound,
And blossoms arise where silence was numb.

- Giovanni Papini
