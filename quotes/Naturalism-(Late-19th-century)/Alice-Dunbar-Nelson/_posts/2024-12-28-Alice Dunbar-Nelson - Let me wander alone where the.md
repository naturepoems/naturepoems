Let me wander alone where the wildflowers grow,  

And feel the cool touch of the moss on my feet;  

Let me breathe in the scent of the earth after snow—  

In the heart of the forest, my spirit’s retreat.


See the flutter of wings, hear the soft rustle there,  

As the creatures awake to their whimsical song,  

In the embrace of the woodlands, stripped of all care,  

Where the heart finds its home, where the soul can belong.

- Alice Dunbar-Nelson
