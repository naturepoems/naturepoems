The Citadel
  I found a place, as bright and clear,  
      With flowers and leaves, and trees that splay;  
  A citadel of the boughs,  
      A shelter for a break of day.

  Here, every bird, each gentle breeze,  
      Would sigh, and make a lover's note;  
  And in the heart, true nature sees,  
      That hopes and warmth could stay remote.

  And O, that I might muse this air!  
      For every leaf that falls will know,  
  Beyond the dark, light flowers dare,  
      To hold aloft and heaven show.

- George Herbert
