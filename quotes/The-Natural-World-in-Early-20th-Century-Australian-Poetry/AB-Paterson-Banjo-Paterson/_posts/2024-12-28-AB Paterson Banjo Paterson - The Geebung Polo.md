The Geebung Polo Club
The Geebung Polo Club has shown
'Tis a sport of manly might,
Where pride and passion often clash
down in the soft moonlight.

Come join me in the green of the open,
With horses screaming out their fate,
We'll play 'til the dawn breaks golden,
A true bushman's spirit to celebrate.

- AB Paterson Banjo Paterson
