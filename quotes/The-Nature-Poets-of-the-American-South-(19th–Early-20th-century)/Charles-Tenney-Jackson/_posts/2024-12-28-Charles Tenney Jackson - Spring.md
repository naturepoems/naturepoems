Spring Awakening
As tender buds begin to swell,
And bluebirds sing their joyous lays,
The world awakens from its spell,
And dances forth in sunlit rays.

The green of grass, a soft embrace,
The flowers bloom in rich array,
The scent of life fills all the space,
As shadows fade and skies turn gay.

O sweet renewal! hark the sound
Of Nature’s hymn, a grand rebirth;
In joy, our hearts are ever bound,
For Spring unfolds her vast earth-worth.

—Charles Tenney Jackson
