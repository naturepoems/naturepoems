Ye glorious hills that rise so high,
Your crowns adorned with clouds of white;
What joy of heaven greets the eye,
When morning comes and spreads its light.

The streams that tumble down your side,
The herbs that toss in verdant cheer;
All nature whispers, far and wide,
In every sigh, loveâ€™s voice is near.


- William Browne
