The Autumn Breeze
    First in the dusk, the furtive breath
    Covers with gold the ground.
    Shin deep, and with a frost,
    Soft and full where the grass lies down.

    It turns silently, sighs. 
    Closer to the wild and warm,
    I hear, touching winds, all the air,
    Regaining vast and pale errors.

- Randall Jarrell
