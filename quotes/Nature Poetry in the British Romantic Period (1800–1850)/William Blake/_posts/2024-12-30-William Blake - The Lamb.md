The Lamb  

Little Lamb, who made thee?  
Dost thou know who made thee?  
Gave thee life, and bid thee feed  
By the stream and o'er the mead;  
Gave thee clothing of delight,  
Softest clothing, woolly, bright;  
Gave thee such a tender voice,  
Making all the vales rejoice:  
Little Lamb, who made thee?  

Dost thou know who made thee?  

Little Lamb, I'll tell thee;  
He is called by thy name,  
For he calls himself a Lamb:  
He is meek, and he is mild;  
He became a little child:  
I a child, and thou a lamb,  
We are called by his name.  
Little Lamb, God bless thee!  
Little Lamb, God bless thee!

- William Blake
