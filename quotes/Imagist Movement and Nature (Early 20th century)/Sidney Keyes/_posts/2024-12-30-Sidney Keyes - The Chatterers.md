The Chatterers

Now the trees are bare and the wind is gone,
There is no one but the hard-faced girl
To hear the light-footed chatterers of the night
As they dart amongst the reaching branches, echoing
Through the bare wood with their wild cries,
Drifting on the wind, their voices lift
The silence from the loam, and on the bare ground
They stumble between the rootsâ€”
For they are soaked in laughter, filled with mirth; 
For she is beautiful who knows their sadness.


- Sidney Keyes
