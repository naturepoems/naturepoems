The mountains rise, majestic and proud,  
a symphony of stone touching the clouds,  
where eagles soar and shadows play,  
whispers of ancient tales abound.  

The river flows around their feet,  
a silver ribbon in sunlight's glow,  
a witness to time's passage  
as it carves its legacy below,  
reminding us, we are but guests  
in this grand echo of eternity.

- Velimir Khlebnikov
