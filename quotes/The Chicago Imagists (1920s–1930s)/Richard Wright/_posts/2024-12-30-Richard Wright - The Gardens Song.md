The garden is alive,
A riot of color and scent,
Bees hum their sweet tune,
As butterflies float like leaves.

Each bloom tells a story,
Of sunlight and rain,
Of hope and rebirth,
In the warm embrace of earth.

I kneel among the petals,
Feeling the pulse of life,
In every inch of soil,
A promise lingered on the breeze,
As nature wraps me in her wisdom.

- Richard Wright
