The Ancient Mariner

It is a mariner in the morning bright,
Near the border of a rock;
He looks far into the sea,
Past the low tide wash that won't stop.

He laughs aloud with a joyous mien,
The delight of fish he knows,
Held close by a feeling espoused
As in the wind the weed still blows.

I yearn, my thoughts turn clear!
How pure the sea, how clean the salt!
With patience won, the heart transcends
And gives me birth to time, the fault!


- Samuel Taylor Coleridge
