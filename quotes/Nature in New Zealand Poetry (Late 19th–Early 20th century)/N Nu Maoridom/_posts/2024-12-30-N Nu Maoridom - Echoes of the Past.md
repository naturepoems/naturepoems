Echoes of the Past

In ancient woods, where spirits sway,
The echoes of forgotten play,
In whispers low, the histories tell,
Of life and love, as time does swell.

With every step, the past ignites,
In every leaf, the truth invites,
To walk the paths where others roamed,
Is to find the heart that guides us home.
