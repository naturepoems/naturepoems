The Darts

I think of the dry leaves,
As you see in eternity,
Ripped and shaken, shifting to despair,
A shadow moving in the air,
And back again over your back.
I see them fly in twos, 
That heartbreak but mislead our way.
They made a wool of the sun
Through the cage of life left behind.

- Ted Hughes
