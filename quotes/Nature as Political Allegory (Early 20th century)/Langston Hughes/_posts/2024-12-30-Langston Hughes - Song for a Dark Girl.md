Song for a Dark Girl

Way down south in Dixie,
Bena,  I was born.
It was the pale moonlight,
That watched our love, that mourned.

I loved a man,
Black as the night,
And we had our way,
By shadows dim and white.

But they took my love away—
Like a flower which clings,
To the bough too frail to hold.
And his heart sang deep, but lost,
For I would let him be.

In the pale moonlight, it came; 
And I lost my love, lost my home.
Way down in Dixie, past black and white,
No light but his song echoed into the dawn.

—Langston Hughes
