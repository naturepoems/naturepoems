The Quiet Orchard
by Robert Lowell

In a quiet orchard,  
apple blossoms sway,  
a perfume of springtime,  
a promise in the air,  
where bees hum softly,  
a gentle lullaby.

Each branch bids us listen,  
for nature speaks in flowers,  
her wisdom woven in petals,  
a sanctuary for the heart.

- Robert Lowell
