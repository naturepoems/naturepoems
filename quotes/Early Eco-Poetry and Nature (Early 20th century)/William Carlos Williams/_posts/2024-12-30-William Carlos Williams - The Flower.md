The Flower

Upon discovering a flower,

Lifting,

It enters new majesty,

A flower, a flower

Used obtaining in person,

Thus met where they are, 

Standing up for the

unpresentable.

Together arise as

the peonies.

What a solemn

Show it isâ€”

A new adventure

launched, as this.

Take care that it minimizes the time it will take

to embrace the

approaching sun.

- William Carlos Williams
