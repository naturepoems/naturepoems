The Meadow

Oh! the playground of the dew— 
The meadow is a charm anew; 
With daisies dancing on the grass, 
Where busy bees in summer pass. 

The wildflowers are bright and gay,
In splendor bold, they weave their play; 
While little creatures hop and leap, 
In joy profound, in daylight’s keep. 

The stalks of golden grain arise,
Like waves beneath the sunny skies; 
And when the wind blows through the glade,
The very whisper seems a prayer made. 

A temple built by nature’s hand—  
The meadow is a holy land; 
Where peace is found in every blade, 
And joy resides that never fades.

- George William Curtis
