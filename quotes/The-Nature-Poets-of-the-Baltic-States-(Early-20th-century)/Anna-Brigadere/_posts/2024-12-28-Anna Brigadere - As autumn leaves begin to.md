As autumn leaves begin to fall,
They paint the ground, a golden sprawl,
Each gust of wind, a fleeting kiss,
A gentle reminder of nature’s bliss.

With every step, the crunch is sweet,
The season’s turn, a rhythmic beat,
In fading light, the world adorns,
A tapestry of hopes and worn.

- Anna Brigadere
