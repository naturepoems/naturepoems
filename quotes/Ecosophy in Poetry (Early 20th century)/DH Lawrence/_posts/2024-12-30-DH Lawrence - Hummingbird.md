Hummingbird

The humming bird,  
That sudden dart  
Brilliant, sulky,  
Stillness, air, a plummet,  
A sudden light.

It zips  
Like a bullet,  
Its smallness,  
A flash, then gone,  
Leaving only the  
Electric minute,  
Parted wings  
Of air that trembles.

Touching nectar,  
A stinger, too.  
It shifts too quickly  
To see, its mouth  
Must delve deep to  
Hold this drop.

â€” D.H. Lawrence
