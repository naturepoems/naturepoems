A Muddy Dog

Your muddy footprints bring me light,
As beneath all moss and muck,
A spirit walks, bright-eyed,
Licking the morning dew clean,
Loving the snow-lined grasses.
Where they curl, a shy step forward,
Unfolding it like petals of blue,
Mirrored into life once again,
What shine reflects the intimate ground?

- Ted Hughes
