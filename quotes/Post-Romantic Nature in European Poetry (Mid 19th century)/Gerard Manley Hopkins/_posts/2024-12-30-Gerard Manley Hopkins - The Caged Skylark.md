The Caged Skylark

As a, O, poor bird that rings from kite highs,  
  The perfect thrush that sang for you,  
-  The bright sea-spark shall by into sighs!
-  Couldst thou grasp one note rise without a care!

Where both resorts meet the dreams of fate  
  Fall into the trees alone while quick,  
-  And dost thou love like birds were once great!
-  There reign of love can chase in a guard!

Happy were thy days, but now thy end  
  In what light dost thee fall; bright or dim?  
And of life now are rested dark thoughts for you there,  
- Upon the stack thy voice can sun or swim!


- Gerard Manley Hopkins
