Dancing Light

The light through trees
  becomes a tapestry,
each shade shifted,
each color defined,
a quiet whisper through branches;
yet it might be a voice,
a laugh between friends,
working on shadow,
and the body moves,
  undisturbed by the speed,
in rhythm through the days,
a gesture towards whatever is here.


- Robert Creeley
