To the Lamp

O quiet lamp that lights the night,
Constant in shade, unyielding in glow,
I see you casting gentle might,
In nature’s arms you float and flow.

Your warmth comforts the winter’s chill,
A beacon of serene repose,
While shadows dance where whispers thrill,
You hold what only night bestows.

With moonlit starlight around, you stand,
In dreams of peace, you hold the hour,
Within your soft and gentle hand,
Is nature’s sleeping power.
