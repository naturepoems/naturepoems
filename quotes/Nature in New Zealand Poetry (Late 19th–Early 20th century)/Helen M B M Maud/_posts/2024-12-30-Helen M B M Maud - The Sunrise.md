The Sunrise

Awake, my heart, as day is born,
With golden rays that grace the earth;
In every beam, the hope is sworn,
For life anew, in joyful birth.

The sky ablaze with hues so bright,
Dissolves the shadows, bids them flee;
Each dawn a canvas, love’s delight,
Where nature paints eternity.

So greet the morn, with arms outspread,
In every color, life’s embrace;
For in the light, the past is shed,
And every moment finds its place.

- Helen M B M Maud
