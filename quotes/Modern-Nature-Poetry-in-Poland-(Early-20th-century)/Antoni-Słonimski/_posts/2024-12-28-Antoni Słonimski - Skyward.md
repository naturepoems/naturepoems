Skyward

When dusky clouds embrace the sun,
Its golden rays begin to fall,
An ethereal twilight, day is done,
A painter’s brush on nature’s wall.

In muted hues, the heavens blend,
As stars emerge from shadows bold,
In the night’s arms, our hearts transcend,
Each glimmer carrying dreams untold.

So lift your eyes to skyward realms,
Where wonders dwell beyond our sight,
In nature’s heart, we find our helms,
As we sail through the endless night.
