How bright thine eyes clasp tender light—
  The dew-spot on the fern!
Of all the wildflower's sheer delight,
  With beauty in its turn.

Shall I place my love on flow’rs so rare,
  Let them blossom in the sun?
As Nature weaves a gentle prayer,
  Let love be ever one.

O blessed is this softer morn!
  Let blossoms sweetly rise;
And linger with the summer-thorn,
  As peace shall fill the skies.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
