The River-Merchant's Wife: A Letter
While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
I played about the front gate, pulling the moss,
In the front gate, and in the garden.

I elbowed my way through the thick bush,
And drew my hand out of the weeds, 
And the rose-trees, bleeding.
They harvest a life of rain, and pluck them in silence.

The moss is heavy with rain, and I wear a skirt of white jade.

- Ezra Pound
