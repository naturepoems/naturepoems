Spring's Awakening

The woods are waking, sleeping paths do stir,
The river’s whispered secrets, soft and pure.
The violets push their heads above the ground,
And over all, the joyful lark's sweet sound.

Each budding branch is tracing out the life,
From harshest storm to love, from war to strife.
The blackbird sings with rapture in the sun;
The dawn is rich with promise—spring begun.

The leaves are lush, and in their dancing play
They greet the morning light in bright array.
Each flower lifts its fragrant cup to bless
The sacred time of spring’s awakening dress.
