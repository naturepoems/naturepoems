Inversnaid

THIS darksome burn, horseback brown,
  His rollrock highroad roaring down,
    Inglewood its drowning, small-naughts about,
  Gripping in gold each rush and dashed-out clout.

  What the darkest, the diviner world
  Then inlaved, that in lustrous pearl—
  Leaves of leaves, all manner of doubt?
        Hisses of boys’ laughing above and below.

  Woman’s sweet silences, kissing the abundance
    Of breathe in gentle glows.
  Italy or more as these peaks exalted,
    Did plant their raw hoed the hers.



- Gerard Manley Hopkins
