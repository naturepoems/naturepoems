Ode to a Great Heart

The light
returns to us
who wait for it,
at the end of a
long cold night.

The quiet
creeps back,
of trees and the
sky, all the
colors of spring and the
smell of flowers
lowered in the
sunlight.

Come back, come
back, bright heart,
come back to the
wilderness. 

Where it all begins, we
want to listen
to the wind,
to the streams,
to the whispering leaves,
as we felt it before,
long ago, deep in the
days of boyhood, 
when we dreamt of
freedom, we dreamt of
life, in the trees and
the rivers,
we dreamt of anything
but sorrow
and stillness.

Let it come, let it shine, 
let life's wonder be
a light against
the shadows.
We are waiting,
we are alive.
