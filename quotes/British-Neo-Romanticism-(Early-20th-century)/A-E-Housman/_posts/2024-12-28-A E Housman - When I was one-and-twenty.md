When I was one-and-twenty  
I heard a wise man say,  
‘Give crowns and pounds and guineas  
But not your heart away;  
Give pearls away and rubies  
But keep your fancy free;  
But I was one-and-twenty,  
No use to talk to me.’  

When I was one-and-twenty  
I heard him say again  
The heart out of the bosom  
Was never given in vain;  
'Tis silent in love, but it's a-dreaming,  
And quickly it’s past for all.

- A E Housman
