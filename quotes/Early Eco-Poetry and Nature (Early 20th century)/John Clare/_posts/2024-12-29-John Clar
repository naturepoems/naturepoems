A dove upon the branch sings soft and clear,
In tranquil woods where shadows play their game;
I feel the earth beneath my feet so near,
Charmed by the spirit of nature as it came.
How splendid is the view, how fresh the air,
When every tree and flower brings me cheer,
So let my heart be light, unburdened, fair,
As I lose myself in beauty, year by year.

- John Clare
