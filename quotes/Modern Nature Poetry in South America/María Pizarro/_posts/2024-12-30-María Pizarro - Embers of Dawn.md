Embers of Dawn

As the horizon blinks awake,
a blush spills over darkened lands,
with tendrils of light stretching out,
a promise for the day to rise.

Birds take to the sky in flight,
a chorus breaking the stillness,
as the sun ignites its fire,
a brilliance that chases shadows.

Each moment breathes with possibility,
a canvas for dreams to unfurl,
inviting souls to step forth,
apart from the night, into the light.


- María Pizarro
