A Dialogue Between the Soul and Body

Body, O body, in which I breathe,  
A world of somewhat; you of dust and clay;  
A little while I cumber the earth's way,  
And shall I straight return to death and thee?  

Soul, O soul, I mean not thee to grieve,  
Since for thy sake I needs must have thy mate.  
This mind of mine, which is of such estate,  
Is but a shadow; yet didst thou believe.  

Body, the night is caper'd with shut doors,  
And day hath ruin'd the day's wrongs by sleep;  
Rage not, but rather hold the calm we keep;  
Since when we part, none but thine own it roars.  

Soul, I will not ask but that thou know  
I am thy death's delight, and do thee grace;  
Here, with full heart, I sit before this place;  
How harsh the sky, and how the winds do blow!  

Body, what palsies reason and my rest â€”  
Kiss me, and let me lose myself such ground  
As tends unto thy good; for to confound  
That rest away in pleasures towards thy best.

- John Davies
