A Bivouac
 
Where the great trees stand tall,
Upon the mountain's wild face,
In the solitude's call,
Here and there wild flowers trace.

We gather at twilight,
In the cool of the evening's embrace,
While the stars glow bright,
And comfort finds its place.

The wilderness murmurs
With stories of long-lost days;
Our spirits it stirs,
In its sweet, solemn ways.

- Thomas Bracken
