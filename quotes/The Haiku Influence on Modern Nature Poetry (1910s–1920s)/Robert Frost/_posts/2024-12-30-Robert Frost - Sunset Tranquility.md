Stature in the sunset almost fell as night,
The stillness was remarkable, upon fair trees,
As clumps of clouds’d kissed by the waters of the sky,
Now climb the treetops as they pulled a breath or sigh.

I longed to see, a man of bonds of time,
And finding stones that told of long-rushed days
Thirsting deeply for that which I have seldom known
To hear the songs the loons sing as night’s now flown.

But to tread within the shadows of tall grass,
To sense the change from fair warmth to frosty chill
And hear the echoes carrying lost serenity,
As purple dim lights rise and whisper once to instill.

- Robert Frost
