Crimson hues of sunset paint the horizon wide,  
a canvas of wonder as day begins to hide.  
In the stillness that follows, magic finds its voice,  
where every creature awakens to rejoice.

The stars flicker softly, in the depths of the night,  
whispering secrets in the shimmering light.  
As I gaze towards the heavens, my spirit takes flight,  
in the embrace of nature, everything feels right.

- Émile Zola
