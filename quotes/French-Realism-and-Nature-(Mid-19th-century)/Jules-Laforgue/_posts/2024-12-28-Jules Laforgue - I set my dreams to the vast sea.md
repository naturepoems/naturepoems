I set my dreams to the vast sea,  
And amid the murmuring waves,  
I scrawled the specters of harmony;  
How many tears brought me to this?  
I could not win the stormy skies,  
Nor find a way to the azure,  
Yet my heart soared in its silent flight,  
In the melody of flowers' perfume,  
In the sigh of the forest deep,  
In the dusk that nestled the mountains.  

Oh, to be the sun, the moon!  
A breath of wind among the ether,  
To feel natureâ€™s thrill within,  
To sing with the lark, to rest with the elm,  
To wander in the fire of the stars,  
To chase the shadow of the evening light,  
That would be my eternal serenade.

- Jules Laforgue
