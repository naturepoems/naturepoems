The Hawk in the Rain
I
In the solitude of rage,
a darkness looms—
a hawk forms against the mist,
a conqueror of the rain.
It cries, a sound of thunder,
a voice of death, 
doing what must be done
to stay whole,
ending the weave of life.

II
And in that wild,
it rules over the earth,
a silence that demands respect.
With each glide, it claims,
it breathes the fury of storm.
All while the raindrops tumble,
a melancholy embrace,
though nothing lingers,
one fierce stroke,
a plague or a miracle,
everything—the hail,
the heather,
the land,
and the sky, too.

- Ted Hughes
