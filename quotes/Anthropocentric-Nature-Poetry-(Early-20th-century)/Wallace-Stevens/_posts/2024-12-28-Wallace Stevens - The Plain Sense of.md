The Plain Sense of Things

The plain sense of things is that
The familiar world in which we live
Is more than a mere given.

Among trees, among grass,
Among bright flowers and smooth stones,
What is passed is our flesh.

The meaning of those things
Is lost in the dark, sacred spaces
And quakes in the frozen hours.

A tree is just a tree, it greets the sun
With arms upturned, to find a space
In a world of wonder.

A leaf falls, and is now part of
What is lost; for where it is growing
Things begin and cannot end.



- Wallace Stevens
