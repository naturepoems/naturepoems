author: Amy Lowell
quote: "The Wind  
    The wind speaks softly through the bleak,  
    Branches swaying in a quiet dance,  
    Telling tales that the stars seek,  
    In its breath, a fleeting chance.  

    Each gust a secret, gently shared,  
    Whispers of time, of days long past—  
    In its caress, all are bared,  
    Nature’s voice in storms amassed."

The Wind  
    The wind speaks softly through the bleak,  
    Branches swaying in a quiet dance,  
    Telling tales that the stars seek,  
    In its breath, a fleeting chance.  

    Each gust a secret, gently shared,  
    Whispers of time, of days long past—  
    In its caress, all are bared,  
    Nature’s voice in storms amassed.
