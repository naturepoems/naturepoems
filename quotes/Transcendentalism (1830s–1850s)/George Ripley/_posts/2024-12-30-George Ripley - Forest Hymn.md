Beneath the arching sky, 
The forest breathes in peace,  
Each leaf a whispered prayer,  
Each branch a slow caress,  
Cradled by the arms of time.

Here in this sacred grove,  
The echoes ride the breeze,  
They jot the earth’s soft song,  
And bring the heart to ease,  
In harmony with what is true.


- George Ripley
