The Wave's Caress

The waves crash upon the shore’s embrace,
A lover’s kiss, tender and fierce.
They pull back the sand, leaving no trace,
Then rush forth again to engulf and pierce.

With every swell, a story unfolds,
Ancient whispers ride on the tide’s breath.
In soft murmurs, the ocean holds,
The histories of life, the dance of death.

Oh, vast sea, your spirited play,
Reminds me of time, of moments unseen.
In the rhythm of your eternal sway,
I find solace, peace, and the in-between.

- Pablo Neruda
