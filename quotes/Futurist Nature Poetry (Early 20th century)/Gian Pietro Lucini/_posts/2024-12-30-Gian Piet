The dawn breaks like a promise,
a soft caress of day,
the world rises, liberated,
savoring the play.

Birdsongs scatter joy,
along the waking trees,
a symphony of lightness,
at natureâ€™s own decree.

Things are bursting forth,
into blooms like laughter,
a radiant celebration
of what we live after.

Breathe in that exuberance,
and savor what unfolds,
for nature shares her secrets,
aglow with dreams like gold.


- Gian Pietro Lucini
