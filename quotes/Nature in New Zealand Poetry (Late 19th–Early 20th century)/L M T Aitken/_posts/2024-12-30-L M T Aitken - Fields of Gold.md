The fields of gold wave in the breeze,
   Like oceans rolling, bright and wide;
Each stalk a story, whispered pleas,
   Of summer's joy and winter's tide.

With harvest's hope, the grain stands tall,
   A testament to labor's grace;
In nature's cycles, we find our call,
   A dance of life in time and space.


- L M T Aitken
