Spring
The world opens much like
  a radiance,
    where blooms swirl wildly
       through the air,
    filling up with flavor,
yellow and pink,
    the wind 
         features us wide;
I see everything
          breathing,
    a wave of life
     lighting every corner,
diving deep into earth,
    as colors seep,
      and laughter spills out
         from each petal.

— Frank O’Hara
