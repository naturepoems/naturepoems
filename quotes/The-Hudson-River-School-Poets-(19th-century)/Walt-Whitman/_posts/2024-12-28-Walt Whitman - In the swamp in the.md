In the swamp, in the glades,
In the winding paths of the forest,
With the leaves and the shadows,
And the fruit that the trees bring,

I wander, I dwell,
Amid the flowers and the water,
Amid the sounds of the birds,
And the rush of the green,

I feel the pulse of the earth,
The endless life that flows,
For in each bird, and each leaf,
The spirit of nature glows.

â€” From "Leaves of Grass"

- Walt Whitman
