Nocturne
The moon is a white spot in the sky,
I see the sheened stars on my window,
So beautiful it beguiles,
Yet I remain awake, while the world sleeps,
Dreaming, dreaming on a cradle of night.

In soft silence, I float on wings,
To the edge of soft twilight,
Yet I am still, yet I am free,
And as the dark descends,
I hear the low voice breathing time.

The moon is etched with romance,
The night’s starshine glows,
And every soft breath of night
Leads me along the stars,
In a night wind's caress, that softly glows.



- Langston Hughes
