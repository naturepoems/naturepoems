Winter Song

When the sky goes dim,
And the hoar frost lies,
I am wrapped in a hymn,
That fain would rise;

The birds are still, and all,
The winds shut down;
In the white-frost beauty,
I dream in a gown.

Yet the sun will arise,
To break winter’s frown,
Then springtime shall fly,
With no mist nor brown.

- Elizabeth Palmer Peabody
