The Nightingale

Beneath the vaulting, silvery skies,
The nightingale in pleasure flies,
With flourish sounds, as hearts will dance,
And through the vale the dreams entrance.

Oh, where the moonbeams softly kiss,
Let shadows twine in murmured bliss:
From treetop high to flower’s shade,
The world subdued, in notes arrayed.

I heard her sing, each soft refrain,
Awake within my tender pain;
In memory's gaze, her voice replays,
Forever bound in night's embrace.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
