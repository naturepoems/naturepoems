The Old Man’s Courting

Come hither, love! When I am old,
I promise thee my heart of gold,
And all the warmth of summer sun,
To bring sweet spring, when winter’s done.

I will take thee to the woods,
Where daisies bloom and life is good,
And in the glade where shadows play,
We’ll dance in the sweet song of day.

- Robert Herrick
