Winter killed the blooms with its icy breath,
Yet beneath the still surface, life’s heart beats.
Know that spring shall awaken those bonds of death,
Underneath quiet sorrow, where hope discreet meets.
In whispering winds and the thaw of the snow,
Nature teaches resilience, all’s beauty repeats.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
