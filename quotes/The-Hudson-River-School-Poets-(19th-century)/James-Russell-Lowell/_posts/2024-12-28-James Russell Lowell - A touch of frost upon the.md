A touch of frost upon the air,
The fading leaves, the brittle grass;
A deepening shade, a hush of prayer,
As autumn comes, and seasons pass.

The stars awaken black and bright,
And all the woods, the glowing night,
Call forth the earth to shed her light,
And listen to the cries of night.

In scent of pine and wild sweet gale,
Let me lie here, through dim decay,
Where dreams of nature gently sail,
To fill my heart with endless play.

- James Russell Lowell
