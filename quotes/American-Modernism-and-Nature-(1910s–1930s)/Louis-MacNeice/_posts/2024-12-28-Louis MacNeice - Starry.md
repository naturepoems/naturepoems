Starry Night
  
  Beneath the stars, the world stands still,  
  The whispers of the night fulfill,  
  The cosmic dance of dark and light,  
  A serene beauty, a tranquil sight.

  The mountains watch with ancient eyes,  
  The winds relay the age-old sighs,  
  And in this breath of night so vast,  
  We find our place, our shadows cast.

- Louis MacNeice
