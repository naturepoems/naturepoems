The Sea is a great heart,
That beats in the day and the night,  
Sending forth its songs of love
To the shore and the stars in flight.
Oh, the voice of the Sea is a calling,  
To the heart that is lost in the gladness of day,  
To dance with the waves in the moonlight,
And lose oneself in the spray.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
