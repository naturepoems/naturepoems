In the Home Stretch
The final touches of the spring blooms
Still elude the warmth, do not take flight.
Yet young hoarse voices carry in tune
The calls of swallows back home tonight.

A lonely heart sings to find its mate,
And all that time can pause, stop, and here,
In onward motion, I hear their fate
As evening gives way to dawn, my dear.

Small patches of time like rose-framed stars
Quicken the breath to a solemn sound,
And before darkness calls them from afar,
There are tasks anew to lift from the ground.

If light should loosen the overthought
Of happiness on every starry sphere,
There, here, I can find the hopes I sought
By holding on without unraveling fears.

This is the home stretch, the long-held word,
And there is truth in all that I have earned.
Each moment whispers softly, like each bird,
Embraced in harmony, so much returned.

- Robert Frost
