The Springtime

In springtime’s breath, the world unfolds, 
Reviving life in hues of gold; 
The earth awakens from its dream, 
To greet the sun’s resplendent beam. 

The birds return with joyful songs, 
As melodies ignite the throngs; 
The blooms erupt in colors wild, 
Against the past, become beguiled. 

Each bud, each leaf, a witness sings, 
Of passion that the season brings; 
And in the air, a fragrance sweet, 
A mixture of love’s rarest treat. 

O spring, thy promise none can feign— 
The hope anew, the drops of rain. 
The heart finds solace in this time— 
A moment that feels most sublime.

- George William Curtis
