Of Mere Being

The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space,
In a part of the jungle of existence,
The palm stands on the edge of virtually all,
In the vastness of the palm, the vastness lies.

The palm is a repeated beat of things,
With the sun restlessly setting, setting,
In the south, where the plants are not listless,
But are lovely and are alive.
In that place is the rhythm of life,
The beat that the palm makes,
Because it stands on the edge of the world.

There is always the moment to be seen:
The palm is a thing that is always seen
With this edge of the world,
Always the feather's stroke of time.
The palm makes always the music of life.


- Wallace Stevens
