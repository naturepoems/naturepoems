The Heart of Earth

In every stone, a history sleeps,
As mountains rise to touch the skies,
The heart of earth, in silence keeps,
The whispers of life, and soft goodbyes.

Rivers carve through time’s embrace,
With stories winding in liquid flow,
The essence of nature’s hidden grace,
In every bend, where wildflowers grow.

So let us tread with reverence deep,
For earth cradles dreams we come to know,
In every footprint, a promise we keep,
To honor the paths where we may go.
