Autumn’s Symphony

The leaves are turning, gold and red,
As autumn’s brush paints paths we tread,
With every gust, a story’s spun,
About the warmth of summer’s sun.

The harvest moon shines bright above,
A time for thanks, a time for love,
In Nature’s splendor, we embrace,
The beauty wrapped in time and space.


- Franklin P Adams
