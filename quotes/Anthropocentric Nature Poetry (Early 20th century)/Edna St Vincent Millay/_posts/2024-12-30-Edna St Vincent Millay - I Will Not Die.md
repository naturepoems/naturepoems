I will not die as you have died,
But I will live to see the sun,
To watch the flowers bloom and thrive,
And take each day as the new one.
My heart, a child of natureâ€™s birth,
Will dance through every stormy hour,
For the earth is my eternal home,
The wild and wondrous flower.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
