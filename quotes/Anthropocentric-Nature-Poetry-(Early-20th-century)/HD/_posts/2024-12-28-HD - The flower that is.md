The flower that is called
in the old language,
by the ancient name
of the lily,    is in bloom.

The sun is a golden disc,
at the center of the garden
where the color bursts forth.

Each petal is a prayer,
each scent rising in honor,
of the natural order.

Here, in this sacred space,
each blade of grass whispers,
edging closer to the warmth.
