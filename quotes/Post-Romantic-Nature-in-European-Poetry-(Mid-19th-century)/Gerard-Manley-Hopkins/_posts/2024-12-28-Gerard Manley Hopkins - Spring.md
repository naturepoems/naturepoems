Spring

Nothing is so beautiful as springâ€” 
    When all things wake out of their sleep, 
        And the rivers to the sun do spring,  
        And flowers pour and grow; 
    But beauty blooms within the loveliness of 
    And see how every day goes on.

The volume rolls of laughter in a voice  
    And here remains a neighbor news.

                                                        -- Gerard Manley Hopkins, 1880
