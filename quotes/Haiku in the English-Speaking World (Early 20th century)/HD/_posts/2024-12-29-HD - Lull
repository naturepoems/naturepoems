Rain falls softly,
a lullaby to the earth,
a soothing embrace,
a whisper of creation.
In every drop,
a history of storms,
a song of survival
that nourishes seeds,
a promise of green,
where dreams take root,
a rhythm of life
that intertwines seamlessly,
the cycle continues,
a dance of creation and rebirth.
