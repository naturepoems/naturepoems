The Ogress

In haunting woods, caught in shadowy nets,
Stalk a shadowed figure with green eyes,
With a heart beat like a tune in depths,
Where life is born, and then it dies.

No vessel would she take,
No sound would scream through the air,
In deadly gaps where spirits break,
And daylight shall find nowhere.


- Samuel Taylor Coleridge
