In the embrace of a valley, where mountains stand bold,
The sunlight peeks through whispers, in flutters of gold.
Each wisp of the wind spins tales of the place,
Where nature unveils her fearless embrace.

Between every silence, the quiet unfolds,
And echoes from winged ones, their journeys retold.
Through every small creature that plays in the glade,
The heartbeat of earth is serenely displayed.


- Willa Cather
