This world of ours is but a stage,
  Where endless wonders play their role.
  Each moment fleeting, yet we'll gauge,
  The beauty cradled in our soul.

With each dawn’s light, a canvas made,
  Where dreams can flourish, hopes can grow,
  In nature’s realm, we are conveyed,
  To treasures seen in every glow.

- Isaak Walton
