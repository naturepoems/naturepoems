Water

I am water,
as you are

and in returning
to you,

I lose nothing;\n

for all,

as it falls, is

brought back
to me

in song.


Let me then be

not the drop,
but

water,
to find you.

Oh, lo! I have

this lost love,
in

it the lonely

s
p
a
n
n
e
r
s

that hold the night,
solitary, wandering

following

light, oh bright!

- William Carlos Williams
