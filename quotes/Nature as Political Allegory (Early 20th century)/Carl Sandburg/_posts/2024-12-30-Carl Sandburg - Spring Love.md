Oh, to love the spring!
Yet still as lovely
As the stars shine in the sky,
And the sun melts the frost,
In the earth of my youth,-

There still lingers a warmth
to sweeten the air,
And life will bundle closely
In crowding embrace.

Such is the dance of spring,
With joy spilling over
In color, in voice,
In laughter that shakes
The straight branches of you and I.


- Carl Sandburg
