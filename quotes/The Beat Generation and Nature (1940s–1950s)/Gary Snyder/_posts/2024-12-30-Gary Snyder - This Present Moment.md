This Present Moment
The sky unfurls,
clearing the gray overtones,
and the breath of spring
sends ripples through the fields.

The meadow is alive with voices,
flitting between the blades,
calling out in clarity,
while shadows chase the light—
a dance beneath the blossoms,
where the past whispers softly.

— Gary Snyder
