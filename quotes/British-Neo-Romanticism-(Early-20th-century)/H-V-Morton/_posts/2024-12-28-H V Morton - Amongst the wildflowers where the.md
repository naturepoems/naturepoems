Amongst the wildflowers where the sunbeams lie,
In the meadows of thought, with a heart touched by sky.
Each petal, each blade, breathes tales of old,
In the dance of the colors, a beauty unfolds.

The stream sings a story, both timeless and bright,
Reflecting the sunlight, a mirror of light.
It tumbles through valleys, whispering low,
A song of the earth that eternally flows.

The hills wear their shadows like garments of grace,
Where the soft sighing breezes weave through the place.
In the silence of forests, where secrets abound,
In the hush of the twilight, pure solace is found.

With each step I take on this sacred ground,
In the embrace of the wild, my spirit is bound.
For nature, she beckons with love and with peace,
In her arms I discover a sweet release.

- H V Morton
