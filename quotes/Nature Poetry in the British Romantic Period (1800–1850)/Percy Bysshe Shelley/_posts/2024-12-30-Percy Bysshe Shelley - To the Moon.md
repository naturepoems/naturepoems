To the Moon

Arise, thou pale sphere of the night, 
And wander on the star-lit sea,  
Await the dusk creeping slowly to close
The arms that clasp the hovering sway
With a soft, ethereal breeze—now descending. 
O’er the waves of encroaching love,
Eclipsing the reason that binds—bring ease 
And thy gentle glow through each thought long behold. 

— Percy Bysshe Shelley
