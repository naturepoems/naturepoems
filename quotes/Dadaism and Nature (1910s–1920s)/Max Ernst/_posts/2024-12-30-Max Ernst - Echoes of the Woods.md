Amidst the ruins
     of yesterday’s dreams,
        I wandered through
    the whispered songs
  of feathered shadows.

   A phantom breeze,
        dances with
    the memories of
  fallen leaves,
        an echo of the woods,
   where the mind is free.

      Here, beneath ancient boughs,
   the heart finds its home.

- Max Ernst
