The Last of the Wild
The mountain rises into blue,  
A dream of majesty above,  
Its peaks like timeless guardians too,  
A place where silence wraps in love.

Yet wildflowers burn in summer’s blaze,  
Their beauty quick but hearts endure,  
And in their fleeting ghostly gaze,  
They boast of days when life was pure.

Ode to the earth where wild things dwell,  
To bask in sunlight without man’s scar,  
Remembered whispers cast their spell,  
As in the distance, a lone star.
