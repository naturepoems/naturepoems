The Wind and the Sun

The wind blew out from the rear,  
And the sun beat down from above  
On the road, in the field, and the sky  
All burning with golden light.  
The sun had the strength of half a hundred  
And was hot and bright as it could
But the wind was bold and fierce  
And roamed everywhere, making frightened  
Little creatures huddled close, whenever  
It blew.  

Then came a shepherd singing,  
With a crown of black on his head  
And his heart filled with cheer, as he strayed  
Along a meadow, far or near,  
With his sheep, dear saints!  

And the wind it blew, and the sun it shone,  
And then between a lonely hour,  
Did one call out to another.  
The sun said, “Oh how can I win  
The friendship of this man so fair,  
With his heart so good?”  

“Let me show you,” said the wind so strong,  
“I will blow his hat away!”  
And before the sooner he came,  
The wind made every heart feel brighter.  

So off it went and the hat was lost  
And slipped onto a hill nearby.  
But smiling and glad, the owner stood  
Because he had lost it to a friend—  
And soon he found the strength to bear.  

Yet suddenly the sun was shining bright  
And whispered kind words through the trees:  
“I will be generous and let him know  
That he is loved and cared for so.”  

And with that love, his heart stood still  
And the warmth descended all around  
He was given a great delight,  
His heart was captured by the golden light.  

So back went the wind, back once again,  
Gently trailing the clouds of soft  
Sweet color that warms the world.
