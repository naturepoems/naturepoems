In nature's depths we've found our peace,  
    Where heart and mind can rest;  
And in the woods, the hills, and bees,  
    There lives the quiet quest.  
For every tree has strength in its core,  
    And every lily shines so fair;  
So let us know, and seek for more,  
    In life's green garden, everywhere!

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
