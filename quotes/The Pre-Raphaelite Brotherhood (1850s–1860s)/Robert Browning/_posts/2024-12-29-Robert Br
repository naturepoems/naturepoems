Prologue to Asolando

At last, when the daylight dimmed and fled,
By soft clouded shores where the sun had bled,
Beneath the trees, by the babbling brook,
I sat me down, with my own little book.

Forget the wars I fought in my soul,
Dismiss the echoes that seemed to troll,
For in the arms of nature’s best lay,
A tranquility that cannot decay.

So wandering forth with each passing flower,
The delicate petals, the intricate bower,
In the heart of the woods, I met my fate,
The love of the world in so little a state.

With whispers of leaves, I penned those lines,
Proclaiming the beauty of nature divine,
And painted each sunset with global delight,
To cradle my thoughts in the dream of the night.

- Robert Browning
