In the stillness of the lake, so clear, 
A timeless mirror, reflecting near.
The mountains stand like sentinels, here, 
Guardians of dreams, of age-old sphere.

The water ripples with every sigh, 
Whispers of nature, as time slips by.
In this embrace, I’ll learn to fly, 
With every heartbeat, I’ll not deny.

So share with me this tranquil space, 
Where life unfolds with gentle grace.
In nature, I find my rightful place, 
In this serene, eternal chase.

- Andrei Bely
