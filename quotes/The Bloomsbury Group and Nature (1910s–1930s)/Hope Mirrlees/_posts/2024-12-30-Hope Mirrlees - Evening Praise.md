EVENING PRAISE

The evening descends with a gentle embrace,
Where the colors bleed softly into the sky,
The scent of the earth wraps a delicate lace,
As the day waves farewell with a soft, deep sigh.

Crickets begin their sweet serenade,
Echoes of twilight, where shadows unfold,
In the hush of the night, all worries cascade,
Where the stars and the darkness weave wonders untold.

On whispers of winds comes an ode to the dusk,
In the shelter of twilight, we find our retreat,
With grace and with reverence, that deep inhaled musk,
The promise of night in a world made complete.
