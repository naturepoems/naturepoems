The air is filled with a sweet perfume,
Where wildflowers dance in the sun’s warm loom.
Mighty oaks stand proud like ancient kings,
Sheltering whispers of the joy nature brings.

A brook babbles softly through the woods,
Telling tales of life and of the spirits it holds.
The rustle of leaves, the chirp of a bird,
In this symphony of peace, there’s not a single word.
