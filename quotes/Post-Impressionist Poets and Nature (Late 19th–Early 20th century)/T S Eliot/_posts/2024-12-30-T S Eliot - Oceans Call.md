Waves crash gently upon the shore,  
   Each rise and retreat, whispering lore.  
   Pebbles shuffled by the tide's soft embrace,  
   The ocean's rhythm sets a tranquil pace.
   
   Seagulls cry above, a call to the free,  
   While dreams wash ashore, like shells from the sea.  
   Here on this canvas, where land meets the blue,  
   Nature's artistry breathes life anew.

- T S Eliot
