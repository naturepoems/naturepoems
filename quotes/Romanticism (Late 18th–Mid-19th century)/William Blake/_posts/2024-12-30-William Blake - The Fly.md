The Fly

Little Fly,  
Thy summer’s play  
My thoughtless hand  
Has brushed away.  
Am not I  
A fly like thee?  
Or art thou not  
A fly like me?

For I dance  
And drink and sing,  
Till some blind hand  
Shall brush my wing.  
If thought is life  
And strength and breath,  
And the want  
Of thought is death;

Then am I  
A fly like thee?  
Or art thou not  
A fly like me?


- William Blake
