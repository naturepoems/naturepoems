The Breeze  
   
A dewy kiss from morning’s breath,  
The gentle sway of nature’s cheek,  
In every gust, a dance of death,  
Yet life embraces all that seek.  
  
O breeze that sweeps across the land,  
In harmony, you softly weave,  
Through hills and fields, your guiding hand,  
In every heart, a place to grieve.  
  
Yet in that grief, a love remains,  
For nature speaks in bittersweet,  
In every sigh, the soul attains,  
A bond with earth, it feels complete.

- Herman Melville
