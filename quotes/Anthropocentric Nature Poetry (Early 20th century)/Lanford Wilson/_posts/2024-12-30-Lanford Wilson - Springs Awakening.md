Blossoms burst forth in grandeur,  
a riot of color,  
a fleeting beauty that sways  
with the soft caress of spring.  
Bees hum their drones of industry,  
collecting sweetness  
from the petals that open  
in gratitude to the sun.  
The air, thick with perfume,  
whirls around, a celebration  
of life returning,  
a cycle that circles  
through the warmth of days.  
Embrace this moment,  
for such splendor holds  
a testament to joy,  
an echo of resilience  
in the heartbeat of Spring.
