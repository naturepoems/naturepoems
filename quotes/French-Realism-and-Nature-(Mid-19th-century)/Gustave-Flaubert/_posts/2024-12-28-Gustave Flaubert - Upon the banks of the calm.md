Upon the banks of the calm river,
Where willows weep and secrets lie,
The sun spills gold on the shimmering water,
A moment suspended, passing time flies.

Fleeting clouds in a cerulean sea,
A canopy of dreams drifting high,
Natureâ€™s pulse sings in silent symphony,
In life's embrace, we are nigh.

- Gustave Flaubert
