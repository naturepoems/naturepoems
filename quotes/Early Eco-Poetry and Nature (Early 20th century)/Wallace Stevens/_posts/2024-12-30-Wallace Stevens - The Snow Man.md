THE SNOW MAN

One must have a mind of winter
To regard the frost and the boughs
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;
And have been cold a long time
To behold the junipers shagged with ice,
The spruces rough in the distant glitter
Of the January sun; and not to think
Of any misery in the sound of the wind,
That is what you must have.

You must have a mind of winter
To regard the frost and the boughs
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow.

To behold the junipers shagged with ice,
The spruces rough in the distant glitter
Of the January sun; and not to think
Of any misery in the sound of the wind.

The listener is one with the trees.
It is the listener who is holding the trees in heart and soul.

- Wallace Stevens
