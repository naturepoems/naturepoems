Beneath the Pines
  
  Beneath the pines, I find my peace,
  The scent of earth, forever near;
  As nature’s wonders softly cease,
  I listen close, my heart will hear.
  
  The rustling boughs, the whispered sound,
  A melody that stirs the soul;
  In quiet moments lost, I’m found,
  Among the trees, I am made whole.
  
  The shadows dance, the sun cascades,
  Each breath I take is filled with grace;
  Beneath the pines, my spirit raids,
  The wild, untamed, in nature’s embrace.


- Dora Wilcox
