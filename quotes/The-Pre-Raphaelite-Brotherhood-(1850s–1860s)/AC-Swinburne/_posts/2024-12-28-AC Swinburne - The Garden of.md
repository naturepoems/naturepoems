The Garden of Proserpine
Here, in the place where the sun and the moons
And the time of the rest lie disheveled
In pink satin; the golden face of spring
Wanders white on the dead of the drear,
The branches croon overhead in deep peace.

There, all sights fade like the flickering wig,
And naught but the winds of the night break the drouth.
For the souls that stood with the gods beside me,
Or the souls that lay fallen with mortals here,
They come with the grace of the dark night’s dreams.
