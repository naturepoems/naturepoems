After Apple-Picking
My long two-pointed ladder’s sticking through  
A tree toward heaven still,  
And there’s a barrel that I didn’t fill  
Beside it, and another heaped high  
With apples that are bruised or rotten.  

The pleasure isn’t in doing this;  
The pleasure isn’t in the height;  
The pleasure is in what we pick and in what’s ripe,  
And in what’s done beyond the joy of men  
As I’ve sensed it after harvest here.  

For I have had too much  
Of apple-picking; I’m overtired  
Of the great harvest I didn’t gather in.  

There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,  
Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.  
For all that struck the earth  
No matter if it fell, was gone.  

The strawberry is a fruit  
That once you get, you don’t have again,  
But the apple is always easy to let go.  

I wear my harvest at the tip of my tongue  
The want, the want is harder to locate  
Than the want in the wind —  
Pick apple — nascent and ripe.  

These apples do not lie at the bottom of  
Some drunken farmer’s barrel;  
They each have known the night;  
They’ve tasted the sun and moon's blend before  
They came here; the future’s ahead of them now.  

As for me to whatever degree this is,  
It’s a work of complex pleasure  
But it’s the waiting that I need  
It’s the wish that keeps on coming back —  
Tools that a man can hold indefinitely.  

But the tree held them up  
In all their shapes and colors  
As every word begets the further fruit,  
So let it go, let it be.  

Tomorrow will hold back its  
True weight of burdens beyond the farm  
Overnight, lost in the rumbling of a night  
And still my head will drop, all useless,  
Dazed from the pulling and weight of the sky.
