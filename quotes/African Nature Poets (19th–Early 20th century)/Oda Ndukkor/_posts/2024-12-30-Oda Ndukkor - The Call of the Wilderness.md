The Call of the Wilderness
The wilderness beckons, wild and vast,
A world untouched by the tick of the past.
In its embrace, I feel so small,
Yet, in its grandeur, I stand tall.

Here, nature's fury meets her grace,
In every corner, a sacred space.
With every step, I’m drawn in deeper,
The call of the wild, an eternal keeper.


- Oda Ndukkor
