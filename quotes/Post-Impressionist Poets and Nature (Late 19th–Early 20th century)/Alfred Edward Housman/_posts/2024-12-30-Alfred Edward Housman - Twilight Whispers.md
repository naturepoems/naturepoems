From distant hills, the shadows creep,
As twilight whispers, soft and deep,
The crickets sound their evening song,
In nature’s arms, where we belong.

In every breath, the night unfolds,
A world of tales that time beholds,
And underneath the star-filled sky,
We find our dreams, where spirits fly.


- Alfred Edward Housman
