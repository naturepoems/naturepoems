The Sea-Wolf

The wind rushed in from off the sea, 
The waves, they broke and roared like a beast, 
In that savage world of tossing foam, 
Where the salt and spray meet for their feast. 

Nature's wildness calls a man, 
To rise against, to lose himself, 
In the splendor of the furious tide, 
To become like the storm, the spirit, the elf. 

He stood upon that heaving deck, 
A grin of freedom on his face, 
For every wave that fell and crashed, 
Brought forth the thrill of natureâ€™s grace.

- Jack London
