In the morning,
The sun gilds the sky,
And treetops awaken
With birds in their flight.

The rivers run bright,
Reflecting soft light,
Dancing and singing
Of the Earth’s morning.

The mountains steadfast,
In their silence reveal,
A wisdom so profound,
Every soul can kneel.

Oh, the beauty unspoken,
Which the world often hides,
Lay your cares upon it,
Find peace in its tides.
— Margaret Fuller
