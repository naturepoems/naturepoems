Skyward

I look to where the distant mountains rise,
A violet bastion against the sky,
Magnificently regal in their guise,
Wrapped in eternal blue, serene and high.

Clouds drifting lazily, like thought in dreams,
Veiling the sun's bright laughter from the shore,
Yet when they part, the light in radiance seems
A jewel set in azure's solemn door.

- Paul Hamilton Hayne
