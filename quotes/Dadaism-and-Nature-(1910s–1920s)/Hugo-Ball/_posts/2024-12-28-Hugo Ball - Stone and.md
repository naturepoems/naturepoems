Stone and Sky

A journey from earth to heaven,
The mountains inhale the sky,
Stones wear the scars of silence,
Guardian of whispered tales,
With each crevice, a history,
Time’s majesty etched in breaths.

Rivers weave through the fabric,
As laughter spills into valleys,
Where clouds cradle the echoes,
Creating the symphony of winds,
In this orchestra of nature,
Our spirits rise, intertwined by fate.


- Hugo Ball
