Ode to Innocence

My soul is a rose,  
And in its gentle hue,  
It beckons to you,  
To witness the fine dew.  

Let the dawn arise  
And give births to all joys,  
Let the limbs stretch through skies,  
And let natureâ€™s hearts hear your voice.  

Your love is a sweet embrace,  
In such innocence, we find,  
A hope laid in the open space,  
The wonder of all mankind.

- William Blake
