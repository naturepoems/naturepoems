A field of daisies meets the dawn,
With petals soft, their beauty drawn.
Here in the light, I find my grace,
In every bloom, a warm embrace.

Nature whispers secrets sweet,
In vibrant hues, my heart shall meet.
Oh let me lose these worldly cares,
With every flower, my spirit shares.


- Zora Neale Hurston
