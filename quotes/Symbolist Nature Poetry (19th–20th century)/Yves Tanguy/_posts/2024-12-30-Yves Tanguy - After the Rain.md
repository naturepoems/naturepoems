Amidst the gray of stormy skies,  
A flash of light, a hope renewed,  
Where rain cascades and nature cries,  
Life blooms again, forever viewed.

The scent of rain on thirsty earth,  
A balm for wounds as life takes hold,  
With every drop, a joyous birth,  
Nature’s tale of beauty told.


- Yves Tanguy
