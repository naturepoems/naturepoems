The River
---

The river runs, both deep and wide,
In emerald shades, it glides, it goes—
Untamed still, in summer’s pride,
Where the sun brings brilliance to rose.

Once calm and cool, once dark and deep,
Now murmurs quick with life anew,
For every pulse it whispers, sleeps—
A sacred bond to me and you.

---

Let us listen to earth's sweet song,
Where every stream leads right along.


- Henry David Thoreau
