The Mountain’s Heart

High above on rocky crags,
Where the air is rare, and silence brags,
The mountain stands, proud and tall,
Guarding secrets beneath its thrall.

Echoes of ages, whispers of stone,
In the solitude, we find our own,
Nature’s fortress, timeless and grand,
In its embrace, we understand.

- David C Okwuosa
