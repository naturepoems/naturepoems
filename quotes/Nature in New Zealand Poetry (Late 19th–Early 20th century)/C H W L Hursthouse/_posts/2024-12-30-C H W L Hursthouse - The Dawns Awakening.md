The Dawn's Awakening

With gentle hues, the day’s begun,
The dawn awakens, a silver sun.
As light spills forth on sleeping lands,
The world ignites at nature’s hands.

The early mist, a curtain fine,
Gives way to dreams that intertwine.
And in this moment, peace prevails,
As hope anew, the heart exhales.

So cherish each dawn's sweet caress,
For in its light, we find our best.
With every sunrise, life's rebirth,
In whispers soft, we’re bound to earth.
