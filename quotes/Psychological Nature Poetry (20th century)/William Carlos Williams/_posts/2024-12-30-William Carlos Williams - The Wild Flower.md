The Wild Flower

An axe cuts  
a wild flower  
in the midst of  
its time.


The beauty will  
not hide  
behind.  

It reverses  
itself  
into distance  
before lust  

of color breaks.

Wherefore,  
in much breathing,  
by force of despair,  

there is a sense of wished  
freedom  
that the blossom takes

- William Carlos Williams
