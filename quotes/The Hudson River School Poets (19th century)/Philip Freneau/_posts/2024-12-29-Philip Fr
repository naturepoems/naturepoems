The Valley of the Hudson

Here in the valley, so rich and wide,  
The rivers quench my thirst;  
And here I wander, with hearts beside,  
As time flows soft, but tamed at worst.  
The dewy leaves speak gently low,  
And the waters frolic freely near,  
In the cradle of beauty whence I grow.



- Philip Freneau
