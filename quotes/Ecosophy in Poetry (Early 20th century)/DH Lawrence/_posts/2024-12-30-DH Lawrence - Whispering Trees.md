Whispering Trees

The trees are whispering  
In the velvet night,  
And the moonlight seeps  
From their matted leaves  
Like laughter on the water.

They dance behind the  
Secret veil of dark,  
Softly cradling the stars,  
For lovers away,  
Guiding their secrets beneath.

Hushed murmurs rise and  
Forget their quietude,  
Caressing the heartbeat  
Of the slumber stillness,  
This world that never sleeps.

â€” D.H. Lawrence

- DH Lawrence
