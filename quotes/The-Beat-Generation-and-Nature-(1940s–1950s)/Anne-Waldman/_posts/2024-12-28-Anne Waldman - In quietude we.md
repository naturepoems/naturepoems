In quietude we find
the voice sharing,
a sort of pulse,
a breathing of earth,
a continuity,
whisper of the stones,
secrets waiting to unfold,
where each blade of grass
is mischief, joy,
a testament to growth.

Here in silence,
Wind hums to the boughs,
as we walk, light-footed,
under the shadows,
I share my breath,
with every creature,
each bloom, each sigh,
we are one, intimate,
voices of this vastness.


- Anne Waldman
