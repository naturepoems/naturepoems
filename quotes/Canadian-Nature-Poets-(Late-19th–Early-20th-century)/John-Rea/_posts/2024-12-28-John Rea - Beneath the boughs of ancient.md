Beneath the boughs of ancient trees,
Where shadows play and sunlight weaves,
A quiet peace, a gentle breeze,
In nature's heart, the soul believes.

Each creature sings, each flower sways,
In harmony, they find their song,
Through tangled roots and winding ways,
We walk the path where we belong.

- John Rea
