Before the Dawn
In the hush before dawn,  
yet to be broken by the sun,  
a fragile peace blankets the world,  
a pause, breath held tight.

The sky shifts from dark to grey,  
a promise hidden in the shadows,  
as the earth awakens slowly,  
preparing for the dayâ€™s embrace.

This liminal space,  
a canvas of dreams,  
is where I find my solitude,  
a whisper of all that is to come.

- Ruth Padel
