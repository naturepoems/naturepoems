The earth is our home,
The sun is our witness,
The wind carries whispers,
And the trees regard us with ancient faces.

In the dunes, shadows of memory dance,
While rivers carve their stories,
Every creature, every plant,
Breathes the poetry of existence.

Harmony sings in the rustling leaves,
In the warmth of the Southern sun,
A symphony of life, intertwined,
In the embrace of the natural world.

- Nadine Gordimer
