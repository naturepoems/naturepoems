The night is darkening round me; 
The wild winds coldly blow; 
But a tyrant spell has bound me, 
And I can't rage against the foe.

The earth is dark with tempest; 
The tree-branches bow low; 
But the stars are bright, shining 
And urge me to see them grow.

Please, can I but hear the story?
Can the rustling leaves be kind, 
If I pause in the soft light, 
Will you hear my voice behind?

My heart has loved the sunset, 
And craved the fading hue; 
And I stand, caught in twilight, 
Dreaming of bold shades anew.


- Emily Brontë
