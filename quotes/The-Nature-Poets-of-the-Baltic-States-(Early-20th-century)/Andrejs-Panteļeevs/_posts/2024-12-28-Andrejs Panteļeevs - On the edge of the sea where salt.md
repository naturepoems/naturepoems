On the edge of the sea, where salt meets the land,
Waves crash like laughter, wild and free,
Each tide brings a new story, a fresh strand,
In this dance of nature, I find my decree.

Seagulls cry out, threading through the blue,
In harmony with the pulse of the tide,
The ocean sings secrets, ancient yet new,
And in this embrace, I set my heart wide.

- Andrejs Panteļeevs
