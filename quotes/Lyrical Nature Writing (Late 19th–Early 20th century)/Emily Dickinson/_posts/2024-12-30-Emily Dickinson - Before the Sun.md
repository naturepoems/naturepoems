Before the Sun—  
And the Wind—  
I learnt to know—and Trust;  
In the dim Light—  
A sound—I knew—  
As all the Fowl and Dust—  

No Gossip ere to Know  
Of all the Secrets spoken—  
The Trustful and the lonely—  
Beside a compassionate token—  

No foreign world indeed  
For Winter's Come—  
I trust you to always bring—  
As the day returns With Fire—  


- Emily Dickinson
