And I have felt a glory,
In every little thing,
The flowers, the grass, the small delights,
Of natureâ€™s gentle spring.

The tree that waves its arms,
The river singing by,
All speak a fertile language,
That draws the heart up high.

I find the echo of my soul,
In nature's vast report,
And when I gaze upon that whole,
I taste divine consort.


- William Wordsworth
