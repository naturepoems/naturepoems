Mountain Shadows

High above the world I wander,
where eagles soar in quiet grace,
a realm where time seems to linger,
a solid place against the sky.

Every peak holds ancient secrets,
glimpses of earth forged in fire,
a history carved in stone,
a testament to the storms endured.

I find my spirit in these heights,
a freedom that swells like the dawn,
as each breath pulls in the wild,
a communion with nature's heart.


- María Pizarro
