A Negro Woman Speaks
I am a black woman of the past,
I belong to the dawn.
My soul is a river, a swirling stream,
Each ripple sings a song.

My heart is deeply rooted
In the rich, loamy soil
Of the earth and sky,
And my spirit rises
Like smoke beneath the stars.

A black woman speaks,
Through the voices of the wind,
In the echoes of laughter,
Where the sun still shines,
And where I can be free.



- Langston Hughes
