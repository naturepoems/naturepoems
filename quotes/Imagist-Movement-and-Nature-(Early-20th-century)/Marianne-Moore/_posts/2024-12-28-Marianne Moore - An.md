An Octopus

Mysterious mollusk,
underneath the sea, tentacled,
you embrace the water’s flow;—
a tapestry, that rich,
spun showing bends the light,
mixing color and truth;
for the waves you are a mirror,
where shadows and scales might burst,
while in your world of absence,
you mingle material with spirit.
And at midnight,
your dance endows
all the secrets to delve
into.

—Marianne Moore
