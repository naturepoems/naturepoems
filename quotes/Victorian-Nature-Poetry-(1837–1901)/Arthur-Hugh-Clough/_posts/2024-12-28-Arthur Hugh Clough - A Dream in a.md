A Dream in a Dream

I Dreamed that I saw the morning light,
   A sunbeam dancing down;
And nature turned from dark to bright,
   And smiled on the ancient town.

The fields grew green, the flowers awoke,
   They opened to the day;
A thrush sang sweetly, a lark thus spoke,
   As I wandered far away.


- Arthur Hugh Clough
