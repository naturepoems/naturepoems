The Wind Among the Reeds

    The wind has words to say,
    Whispers soft and low,
    It stirs the morning grey,
    And carries joy's sweet flow.

    O let the wind entreated
    Make music in our hearts,
    For all the world is greeted
    With nature's countless parts.

    So dance and sing and cheer,
    As the reeds sway and sigh,
    For every whispered fear,
    The wind shall calm, oh why?

- George Meredith
