The winds that weave through fields of grain,
Bring tales of old, of lost delight,
In every gust, a sweet refrain,
A symphony of day and night.

The sunset lingers, painted bright,
On all that nature holds so dear,
In its embrace, thereâ€™s pure respite,
A fleeting moment, crystal clear.

- Anna Akhmatova
