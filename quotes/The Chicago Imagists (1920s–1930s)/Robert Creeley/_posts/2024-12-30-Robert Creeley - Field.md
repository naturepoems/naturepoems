Field

Spraying wild, each blade,
  something of wildness,
yet rooted through stone, 
it holds fast,
  the field tumbles,
ground underneath, alive
each breath held between stories,
a path wanders on,
while the heart beats, 
a connection we share,
a pulse of life,
evolving yet standing,
quiet energy,
in the embrace of the field.


- Robert Creeley
