I wonder if the Bee  
Is buzzing in the trees,  
Or whether he is far away  
On other honeyed keys –  

Or is it the lazy ant  
Who walks the winding line  
With little cares upon his heart  
And manners so divine –  

I hope the world is gay and bright,  
When Nature smiles at me,  
Perhaps the greatest gift of all  
Is in her harmony –

- Emily Dickinson
