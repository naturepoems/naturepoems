In Blackwater Woods

Look, the trees
are turning their own bodies
into pillars of light,
are giving off the rich
fragrance of cinnamon
and fulfillment,
are braided
with the silk of the moon.

As the flock
of blackbirds is wishing
to be free and has melted
into the dark of nature’s night,
with the beauty there,
a whole night is progressing
and full of spirit.

In the darkening woods,
I will tell you how it progresses,
on the sights that are new,
you will get rid of your fear,
write on the wind,
and know how it journeys,
so wild and so slow.
We can be free,
we just have to hear.

This is the close of our lives,
with the tiny buildings
of sight all assembled here,
the pretty dawn breaking,
and the line of gold coming in
with the stars. All will be alright.

What can you ever do,
you who are only
who will need to be?
You are here.
It’s perfect.

Let us loosen the grip
of what we think we have,
we will learn
what we cannot see. 
It’s alright,
it’s a long moment in the world!
Come into the woods,
drink it in again.
It’s a lovely thing to need a place,
to accept our own smallness,
our place amidst the night.

- Mary Oliver
