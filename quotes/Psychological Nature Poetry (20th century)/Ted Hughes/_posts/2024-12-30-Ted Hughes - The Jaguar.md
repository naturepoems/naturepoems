The Jaguar

The apes yelp, and the jaguar
Is showing his spotted coat.
Against the slab of white stone
Where the pike pierces the caught
fish, where the floodweed drips.
He is prowling. He is furious.
Outside the door a peacock
Stands with his tail held high—
A few more grease spots
Will exactly finish him.

His eyes have a cue
From his concrete corpse heart.
Trail of blood, bushy tail,
That's all he is—the jig
Of each prickly leaf,
The sticky-out ears,
The anxious tail twitching 
Out of sight; an empty patience.

But the jaguar
Has feet that are born to the wild,
To the silent field,
To the limpid pools.
The jaguar is hungry for meat
And to be free. He belongs
In the dense, empty corners
Of the forest. His nimble hunting
Turns clear vision
Into blood flows.
His mind is still lapping
Round the panther’s riddle.  
At the edge of the field
When moonlight strikes,
His fangs will find prey,
A brief shudder of freedom.

And now I am feeling his thoughts tumbling
