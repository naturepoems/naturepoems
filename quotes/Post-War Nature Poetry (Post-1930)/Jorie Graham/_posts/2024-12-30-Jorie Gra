A Golden Light
from The Dream of the Unified Field

—

A golden light enters yellow, folds beautifully 
in the blurred clouds, how I mistake it.
Maybe it’s what each beginning is for—how, much later, 
it seems absurd to hang a name.
I had a tree sing for me and I knew a body ought to seem as alive 
as the suns in the beginning.
To place yourself under the veil of a night, always running
& I can sense the rain grow old softer, 
carried into lily’s breath.
What death arises here? How the soft thoughts gather.
This sweetness speaks life back from the very end.

- Jorie Graham
