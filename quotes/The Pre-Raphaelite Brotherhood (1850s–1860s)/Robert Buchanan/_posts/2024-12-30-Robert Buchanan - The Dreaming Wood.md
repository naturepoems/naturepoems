The Dreaming Wood

In the dreaming wood of night,
'Twixt the stars and golden leaves,
Shores of silver in the light,
Whispering winds speak what he weaves.

Within thy arms of quiet  sighs,
Beneath thy shroud of nature’s grace,
I breathe the air where silence lies,
And lose my cares in this soft place.

- Robert Buchanan
