With every breathing moment under the sun,
Nature cradles us in her bounteous arms;
Each chorus of life, a symphonic delight,
Awakens our souls to the dance of existence.

The earth sings songs of resilience and hope,
In harmony with the rhythms of time;
Within this embrace, we find our place,
Forever bound to the magic of lifeâ€™s flow.

- Anna de Noailles
