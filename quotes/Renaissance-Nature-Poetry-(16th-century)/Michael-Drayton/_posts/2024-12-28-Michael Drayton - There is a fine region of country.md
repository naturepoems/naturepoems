There is a fine region of country,  
The best of all the rest;  
Which if a man should choice  
Of all the world might make,  
'Tis that of fair Arcadia,  
Where Nature doth herself delight;  
The streams do glide, the woods do shade,  
And all that’s rare, laid open lies.  

The sun shines there in gentle smiles,  
The trees are laden well with fruit,  
And all that Nature doth provide  
Brought forth to joy the man that’s good.

- Michael Drayton
