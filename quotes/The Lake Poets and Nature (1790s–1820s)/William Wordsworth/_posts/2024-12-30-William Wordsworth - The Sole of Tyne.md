The sole of Tyne, the sole of stone,
With all its gestures held; by sea and bone,
Finches wheel and call beside the stream,
And I embark, forth to the dream.

With thoughts of glass, and sea-worn spree,
The ripples form, in quiet glee,
For here, my heart takes to the skies,
A journey made—where Nature lies.

- William Wordsworth
