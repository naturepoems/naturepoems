The Daughters of the Night

In the night of blue and white
The stars tremble,
In the darkness of the trees
A wind ripples through,
The daughters of the night
In their silver garments
Stand quivering like lilies
Among the foliage.

The little silver voices whisper
Their secrets into the scented air,
Each stroke of light a sigh,
Each sigh a starlit resonance;
And the trees themselves are part
Of this language, this communion,
As they tremble with meaning,
With every leaf a motion of profound delight.

- D H Lawrence
