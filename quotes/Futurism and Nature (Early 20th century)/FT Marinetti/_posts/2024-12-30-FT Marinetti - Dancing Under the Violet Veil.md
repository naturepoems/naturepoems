Dancing under the violet veil,
Nature submits to the whispering night,
Where shadows play in the moonlight,
And the earth heaves with answered prayers.

A cacophony of chirps and purrs,
Joined by machines pulsing beneath,
Every note tells a tale of wildness,
Each sigh matches the heartbeat of Life!

So let time twist in the rush of winds,
As we relive the beauty of youth,
In the arms of the universe,
Where wildness holds the threads of tomorrow!

- FT Marinetti
