from a tree,
in the backyard.
It lies, untouched,
alone on the grass.

A moment of peace,
in quiet embrace,
of the earth below,
under skies of blue."

A leaf falls
from a tree,
in the backyard.
It lies, untouched,
alone on the grass.

A moment of peace,
in quiet embrace,
of the earth below,
under skies of blue.

- William Carlos Williams
