Ode to the Sea

O Sea! whose voice is beauty, and whose breath
Is wealth and thoughts that float as light as air—
In thy broad bosom life and death repose,
And each loud tempest, and the gentler breeze,
Speak but thy praise; the summer's golden breath
Kindles thy waves to silver, while the light,
That glances o'er thee, trembles and renews—
O Sea! thou art the mirror of the skies,
The bosom of the sun, the home of stars!
Saintly indeed the grand horizon bends 
To calm repose, or speaks thy fury fierce,
Yet still I love thee, amid the stormy strife;
For every yearning that is borne to thee—
Every dark wish, each heart's deep pang—
Is but a hymn of hope that far above
The tempest's roar, or in the silences,
Shines forth the love of God.
