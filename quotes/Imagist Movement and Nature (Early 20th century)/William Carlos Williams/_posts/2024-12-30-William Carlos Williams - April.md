April

The green

and the white

and the red

and the blue

of the earth

are full of a cry

for light

when the sun

is ready

to crack open

the shells

of winter.

It is worth it

to observe

the place

what red calls the heart

and so bare

and brilliant.

April is here!

- William Carlos Williams
