Oh, the rivers run so deep and wide,
They carry stories on their tide.
In their currents, life flows free,
A journey boundless, eternally.

The hills stand witness, ancient, proud,
To the whispers of the earth, loud.
Every leaf, every stone, a song,
Reminds us where we all belong.

In nature's heart, we find our place,
A tapestry of love and grace.
For in this world, both wild and fair,
Lies the comfort that we all share.


- Juliusz Słowacki
