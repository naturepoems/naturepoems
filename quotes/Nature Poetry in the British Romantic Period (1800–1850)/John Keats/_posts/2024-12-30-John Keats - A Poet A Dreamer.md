A poet, a dreamer, of spectral sighs
Thy fair form haunts my waking dreams,
Yet may my spirit still be light as a breeze
And follow thee through the bloom-drenched streams,

Where welling waters hang by the bough,
And rippling silver plays on the ground,
Where all my yearning finds heart's release,
And longing's echo is ever found.
— A Poet, A Dreamer

- John Keats
