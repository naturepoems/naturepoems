The Garden

The garden is a pleasure-house,
a house of all delight.
In it, I shall collect
and make my home,
my garden among the stones;
I shall have a rich light,
a light that glitters on the dew.
Here I shall walk,
stay, die and rise,
cut to strife for the hive,
fender, plotting with the sun;  

a breast, slipping soft
beneath the leaf,
and down, the field,
a nest made close,
why should the green stem
hold a broken spine?
Should I not know the night
and suffer to the last; 
please ye, grow up, the leaf set in the light.
