A Dream of Winter
Snowflakes drift and descend
like memories in the frost
and the nights spread their wings
over nothing
and I think of warmth,
Of the burning fires
gathered at the walls, but outside
the cold drags slowly by,
a gentle monster.

And still we stir inside
dreaming of aging carefully,
we dismantle nature
like the falling snow, one flake at a time.


- Lawrence Ferlinghetti
