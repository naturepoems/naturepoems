The brook is music sweet and clear,
A voice that whispers through the trees,
With gentle rhymes that linger near,
And harmonize with summerâ€™s breeze.

It travels forth from hills so bright,
Where blossoms spring, so fair, so glad,
And trails its hand of white delight
Among the wildflowers that once were sad.

- George Edward Woodberry
