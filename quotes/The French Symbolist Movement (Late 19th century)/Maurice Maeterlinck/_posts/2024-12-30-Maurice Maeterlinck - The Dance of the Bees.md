Oh the little bee, oh the busy bee,
Flying from flower to flower,
Working, gathering nectar, oh buzz, oh glee,
In the bright and warming hour.
Natureâ€™s secret the little bee knows,
In each petal her magic lies,
Creating sweetness where the garden grows,
Beneath the vast and speckled skies.

- Maurice Maeterlinck
