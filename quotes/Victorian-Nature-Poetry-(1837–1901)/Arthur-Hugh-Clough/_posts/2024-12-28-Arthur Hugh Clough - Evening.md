Evening Landscape

The sun is down, and silence reigns,
   The stars are dim, deferred;
The softest sound of distant trains
   Is the only thing that’s heard.

The trees stand dark and bare in sight,
   The fields all hush and yield;
The night winds sing with pure delight
   Across the lonely field.


- Arthur Hugh Clough
