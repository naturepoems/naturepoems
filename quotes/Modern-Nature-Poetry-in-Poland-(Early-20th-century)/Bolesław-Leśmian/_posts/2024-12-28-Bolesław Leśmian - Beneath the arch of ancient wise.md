Beneath the arch of ancient, wise trees,
Life bustles softly in shadows and sun,
Where the whispers of history ride on the breeze,
And tales of tomorrow wait patiently spun.

The seasons converse like old friends at dusk,
In the murmurs of Leaves beneath tender skies,
Every moment a treasure, every sigh a husk,
And the heart beats in rhythm with nature’s replies.


- Bolesław Leśmian
