The Call of the Wild

Raging within, hunger quenched,
  And to sleep I may yet wake
  To promise low someday again,
With the call of woods,
That clear shape dawn and dusk and shine.
But wing of late found into sigh-born robe 
When honeydipped around the lake blew, 
  High flickers bending dew
And every branch does call for me—  
Long joyous passion core me once the burning night,
The tree like grows through foes the opening bend.
Each clash of things a soul we steal when sweet, 
Past moon tears my blossoms sovereign flight—and my craven pride—
And the yearning descend when rivers flow divine.


- William Butler Yeats
