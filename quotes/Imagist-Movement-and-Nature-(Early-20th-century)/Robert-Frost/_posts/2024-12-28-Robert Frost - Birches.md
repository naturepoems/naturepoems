Birches

When I see birches bend to the withered boughs
Of the old, I like to think some boy’s doing it.
 swinging them back and forth to make them balance:
new in the summit, but they seem not to feel it.

I’d like to get away from earth for a while
and then come back to it and begin over.
May no fate will happen to me there.
It would be good both going and coming back.

I’d rather see the trees in a snowy background
Than befrozen under their remaining long and dark.
It’s just not the same for one to see
The points on the earth through throtting snow.

- Robert Frost
