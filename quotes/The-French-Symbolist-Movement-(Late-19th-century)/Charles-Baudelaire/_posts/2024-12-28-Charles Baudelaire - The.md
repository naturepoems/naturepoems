The River

The river runs through its own soft dreams,
Winding along the pureness of wild musts,
Haunted by echoes of magic sounds,
As clouds drift, summoning ancient dusts.

Flows pictures meet the itinerant dawn,
Ghostly shades brightened, where eternity spars,
Like a gentle whisper, each current drawn,
Bearing the love scents, as deep as the stars.

And through the seething, the silvery gleams,
The laughter of sky and water mirror sweet.
Yet still, at the end, a heart dissects dreams,
Pleading for peace where life will not retreat.


- Charles Baudelaire
