The Fringed Gentian

Hast thou seen, sitting low in the glade;
The beauty of an autumn-laden day?
Bloom a perfect bloom on the gentle head
Of the dartel fringe, beautiful as air!

The world has too heavy a true embrace,
Yet the fringed gentian leans to brush aside
With dainty petals, delighting in the sun,
While singing softly to the leafy boughs  
That bow and breathe a aerial fly.  


- Matthew Arnold
