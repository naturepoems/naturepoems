With every seed that drops,
an echo of eternity,
a cycle of births,
yet in the frenzy of industry,
it brings urgency, â€“
a need to grasp the earth,
a call towards rebirth,
reminding us beneath skyscrapers,
the ancient roots still hold,
ancient wisdom of the soil.
Nature waits.

- Margherita Sarfatti
