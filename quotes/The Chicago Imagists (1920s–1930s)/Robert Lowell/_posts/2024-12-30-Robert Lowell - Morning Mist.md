Morning Mist
by Robert Lowell

In the morning mist,  
the world is wrapped,  
a blanket against the day,  
as silence hums,  
spirits rise from the ground,  
in the dew that remains.

The sun peeks through  
drawn curtains of gray,  
as rays sparkle and dance  
creating a symphony,  
where nature takes her breath,  
in the soft whispers of dawn.

- Robert Lowell
