---

Under the twilight hues,
a silence overcomes the lake,
it shimmers with the kiss of stars,
a cradle for dreams unspoken.
I sit at the edge, contemplating,
where the water meets the land,
a boundary unmarked by time,
a mirror of the universe.

With each ripple that fades,
echoes of laughter linger,
a wild muddle of memories,
boundless like the sky above.
Gaze into its depths,
discover life beneath,
each flicker a reminderâ€”
a world always turning,
a love that drowns the doubts away.

- Pablo Neruda
