The Aim Was Song
The aim was song.  
My love was full of dreams,  
I had remembered all the umbrellas far down  
Past blooming leaves and trees where  
Himself awoke the day in writing.  
I had listened as he watched the movement  
Of each morning's wind.  
In the space, as light was growing,  
He turned amongst the shades of green  
And trusted I would listen more.  
He turned to grasp it from this early dawn,  
A sea of music gathering silver-bells  
And tinted waves, as if the grasses drew in laying still  
Above himself.  

Time caught me as I wound and wandered,  
The day of living became a slow dream;  
For warm and shining, my song would seep,  
Carried forth from darkness to thereby play,  
Iâ€™ll sing each word along the road,  
Each tune that sweeps through when all were still  
Strange, but ready now to sway.  
I set out to look for his hand,  
And see the world each turn in passing through  
Among the wishes dawned by every child  
As love led into silence, softly stayed.

- Robert Frost
