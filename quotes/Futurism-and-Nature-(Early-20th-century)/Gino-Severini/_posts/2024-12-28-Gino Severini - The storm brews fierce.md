The storm brews fierce, 
a tempest in the heart of nature— 
trees bow, grasses sway, 
and clouds clash in electric dance.

Yet, beyond chaos, comes calm, 
an afterthought, fresh and pure—
the land sighs, washing clean, 
leaving life rearranged, anew; 
a canvas for tomorrow’s dreams.

- Gino Severini
