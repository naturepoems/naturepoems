Winter

Cold and bare, nature coldly falls,  
And the gates are closed around;  
Yet dream I empty of time and storied,  
Resting from the passing hour.  

The air freezes the night,  
But the morning beams a hopeful light.  
What is life amidst the barren lands,
The soul seeks golden hay;  
Yet eternal peace and slumber  
Rests between the snow.  


- Matthew Arnold
