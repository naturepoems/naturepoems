Amidst the fern and the fleeting bee,
Where soft moss carpets the ancient tree,
Each petal and leaf, a note in a score,
Nature's symphony plays forevermore.

With the echo of laughter in misty glens,
And the warmth of the sun where the wild path bends;
In the heart of each pause, in the dance of the day,
Lies a beauty unspoken in nature's ballet.

- David Jones
