In the shadow of trees,
where light filters soft,
memories awake
beneath the dancing leaves.

The moss invites,
a carpet of emerald,
with whispers of rain
on warm summer evenings.

A deer watches,
young eyes full of wonder,
a fleeting glance captured
in nature’s still frame.

Time stands still,
in this sanctuary of silence,
each heartbeat a reminder
of life’s delicate balance.

- Alberto Blanco
