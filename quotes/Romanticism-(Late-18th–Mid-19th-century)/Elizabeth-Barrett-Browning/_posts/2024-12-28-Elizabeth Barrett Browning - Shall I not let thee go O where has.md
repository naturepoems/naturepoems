---

Shall I not let thee go? O where has love gone,
That hath trod me down? To the valley, across,
Flow with thy sweetness, like the moon rolled on!
Be ye a long wind-whisper, or fair grass of night.

With laughter and silence, with voice and face,
I leave you in light to your glorious waste—
If faith can wander, or thirst can gain space.
O nature, if thou own, I have but scarcely paced!

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
