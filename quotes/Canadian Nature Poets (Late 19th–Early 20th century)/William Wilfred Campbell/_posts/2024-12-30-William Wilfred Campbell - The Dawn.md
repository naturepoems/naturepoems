The Dawn

The morning heralds to the light,
  A brilliant joy anew,
  The earth is bathed in amber bright,
  The skies are warmed in blue.

The stars have faded from the day,
  And in their place arise,
  The dews of night have found their way,
  In fragrant lullabies.

The world, with hope, begins to smile,
  The little birds awake,
  And life, across the sunlit isle,
  Is motion, love, and ache.

- William Wilfred Campbell
