The Summer Sun

The summer sun, in radiant blaze,  
Spreads warmth across the endless hills;  
In light, it dances, bright and gay,  
And stirs the heart with joy that thrills.

The fields alive, with colors rare,  
As Natureâ€™s palette bursts in song;  
The gentle breeze, a breath of care,  
Resounding love, where souls belong.

O Summer Sun! You burn so bright,  
You bring the world alive with cheer;  
In every heartbeat, in every sight,  
The beauty of existence near.

- Alphonse de Lamartine
