author: Hart Crane

O just as tidal waves do bristle down the shore,
Each Thought of Light a trembling sigh— 
Where echoes each a touch of fervent lore,
Droplets glide as whispers into night—"

By night the planes of wind share emptiness of sky;  
O just as tidal waves do bristle down the shore,
Each Thought of Light a trembling sigh— 
Where echoes each a touch of fervent lore,
Droplets glide as whispers into night—
