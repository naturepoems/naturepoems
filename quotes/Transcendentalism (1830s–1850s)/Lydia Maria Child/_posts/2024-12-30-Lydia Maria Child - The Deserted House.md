THE DESERTED HOUSE

There is no flock, however watched and tended,
But one dead lamb is there!
There is no fire, however guarded, tended,
But one dead ember's there!
There is no water, however pure and limpid,
But one dead fish is there!

Get wisdom in this world, young men,
To govern your bodies, hearts and minds,
And give not up to those pernicious lies,
That tell you 'Go where your heart finds!'

There is no vale, however lovely,
But one lone tree is there!
There is no stream, however smooth and babbling,
But one dead fish is there!

We learn, oh heart, that house is part of you:
That where you dwell, and hidden things, come back.
Rise then, from dust to Paradise,
And give your hearts a golden hue!

- Lydia Maria Child
