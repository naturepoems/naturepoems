Beneath the Stars
The stars that shine in the night  
A vision longing to hold,  
Beneath the vast sky's delight,  
Where my memories—silent—fold.

The breezes blow with soft insistence,  
Carrying tales woven in glee,  
And my heart beats with a distance  
That allures me back, tenderly.

- Dorothea Mackellar
