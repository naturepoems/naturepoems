Spleen and Ideal

I

The Living is only a heartbeat,
In the race of grey considered,
In the bloomless darkest of the night,
Arise from this acid that homewrecker,
Thou who reigns in the moans of twilight.

II

I plunge my soul in the luminous skies,
I spin my cries like the tranquil sound,
Rising the perfume with the petals fanned,
Opened to the passions yet profound.

III

I adore the frustrated non-existence,
The silhouette cut upon the dreams,
My Veracity â€” Your Idleness,
Undriven through ancient rivers of scream.

IV

O boundless heights, tempered whispers remote,
In thunderies of storms ripened, ablaze,
Violate this hush with unheard notes,
In magic's webs cast me into a daze.


- Charles Baudelaire
