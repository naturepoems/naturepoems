The wind curls gently,
a whisper through old branches,
carpet of leaves beneath my feet:

Nature speaks in shades of green,
shadows dance when the sun filters
through trees, swirling
melodies of a silent symphony.

I find life in every rustle
and heartbeats in stillness,
where nature is an endless tale
woven by invisible threads.


- Margherita Guidacci
