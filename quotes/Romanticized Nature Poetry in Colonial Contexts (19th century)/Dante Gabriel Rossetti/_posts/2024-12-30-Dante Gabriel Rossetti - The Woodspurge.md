The Woodspurge

I
The Woodspurge has a small red flower,
     A little flower, a hill flower;
     It grows in the wood in a cup of clay,
     The Woodspurge has a small red flower.

II
  Grassy grass banks and leav'd trees,
     A little flower like a dark sun,
     With heart of gold and ugly face,
     The Woodspurge has a small red flower.

III
  A little flower blooming without fear,
     With courage enough, would bloom in fire,
     But the Woodspurge has a small red flower,
     A little flower, a hill flower.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
