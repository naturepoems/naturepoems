Rain in Summer

Summer rain lingers as whispers low,
Upon the leaves where the sweet winds blow.
It breaks like jewels from the sky,
And dances lightly as it wanders by.

The flowers lift their heads in dew,
And petals shake off the past anew;
While shadows stretch in the forest plain,
And life awakens from gentle rain.

Oh, summer rain, with your gentle touch,
You soothe the earth with a healing hush;
A calm embrace of natureâ€™s love,
That shines and glimmers from above.

- Wilfrid Wilson Gibson
