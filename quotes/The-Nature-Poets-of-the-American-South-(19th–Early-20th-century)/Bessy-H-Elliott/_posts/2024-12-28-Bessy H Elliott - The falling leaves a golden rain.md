The falling leaves, a golden rain,  
A whisper sweet of autumn's reign;  
They gather 'round as if to say,  
Embrace the dusk that ends the day.  
With every breath, the cycle spins,  
Of loss and life, where love begins;  
In every end, a new ascent,  
A promise held by nature's intent.

- Bessy H Elliott
