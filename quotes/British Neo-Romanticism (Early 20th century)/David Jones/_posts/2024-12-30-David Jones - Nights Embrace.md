As night draws its curtain, the stars gently peep,
In the cradle of darkness, the earth falls to sleep;
The moon bathes the landscape in silvery light,
A guardian watching over the stillness of night.

Each shadow a dream, each whisper a sigh,
In the arms of the twilight, all worries pass by.
Within nature's embrace, I find solace and peace,
In the heart of the darkness, my spirit's release.

- David Jones
