There’s a patch of ground that calls to me,
A haven where I can truly be,
With whispering winds and soft, warm light,
It’s a place where the heart takes flight.

Between the green and golden strands,
Where nature crowns its gentle lands,
In stillness, beauty manifests,
That woven ground, my sacred nest.

- Robert Frost
