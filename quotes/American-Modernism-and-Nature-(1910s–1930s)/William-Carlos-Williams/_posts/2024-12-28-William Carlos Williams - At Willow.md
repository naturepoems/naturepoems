At Willow Grove
Upon a green
wooded hill

an old house stands of
weathered cedar

no clear-sighted

mother of pearl
as its windows

is there to guard the flowers.

What is this veil of

chiffon laid over

the open grave?

A willow stands—

its branches lit like

wings of angels.

The whole great walled world

turns itself backward,

hoping to renew the hours of sun.


- William Carlos Williams
