Through the lavender fields, where the soft breezes twirl,
Amidst whispers of fragrance, in a delicate whirl,
Each color a heartbeat, each scent a sweet song,
In the midst of the blossoms, we truly belong.

The sun in the evening dips low in its flight,
Casting dreams on the petals, embracing the night.
With each passing moment, let the world gently fade,
In the garden of stillness, let memories cascade.

The haunts of the nightingale echo through air,
As shadows grow long, weaving tales unaware.
In the magic of twilight, let your spirit soar,
In the quiet of nature, there’s so much to explore.

So wander through valleys, feel the earth’s gentle kiss,
In the breath of the earth lies an infinite bliss.
For in every petal and each rustling leaf,
We discover the secrets that lie beyond grief.

- H V Morton
