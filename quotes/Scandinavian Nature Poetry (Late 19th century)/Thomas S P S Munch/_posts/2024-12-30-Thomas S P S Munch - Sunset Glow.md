Sunset Glow
As the sun bows low, its golden grace,
a canvas splashed in fiery embrace,
the horizon blushes, a loverâ€™s sigh,
a farewell kiss as day bids goodbye.

With every hue, the heavens call,
the twilight whispers, soft and small,
yet in this moment, the world stands still,
wrapped in magic, in nature's thrill.

The sunset glow, a fleeting treasure,
a promise painted with timeless measure,
in the heart of dusk, I find my peace,
a harmony born, where worries cease.


- Thomas S P S Munch
