In the morning haze,
  The heavy dew can trick you,
  With its crisp bite, while the leaves,
  Drift gently like the thoughts
  That shunned me in sleep.
  I trudge along the pond,
  Each unexpected ripple
  Slicing the silky surfaceâ€”
  Reflection bursts into myriad
  Pieces, forgotten grains
  Of timeless light.

- Sylvia Plath
