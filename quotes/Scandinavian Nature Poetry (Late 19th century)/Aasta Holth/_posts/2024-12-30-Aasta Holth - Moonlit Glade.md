Moonlit Glade
In the moonlit glade, a silver light,
Casts shadows soft upon the ground,
Where magic weaves the cloak of night,
In every rustle, joy abounds.

Creatures stir beneath the trees,
Awakening to nighttime's grace,
The world sways gently with the breeze,
In natureâ€™s arms, we find our place.
