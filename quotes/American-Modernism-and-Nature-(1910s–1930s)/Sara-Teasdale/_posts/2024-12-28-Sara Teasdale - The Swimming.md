The Swimming Pool

In the stillness of a summer's day,
The water sparkles like a jewel,
I enter slowly, float away,
In the shimmer of the cooling pool.

The sun dips low beyond the hill,
As shadows beckon soft and sweet;
The day retreats, the night is still,
And crickets join me in a beat.

- Sara Teasdale
