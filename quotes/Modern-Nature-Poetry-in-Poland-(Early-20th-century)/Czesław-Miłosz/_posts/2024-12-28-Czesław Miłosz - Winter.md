Winter

The quiet of winter,
almost a prayer,
a stillness that enfolds,
while snow blankets the earth.

I hear the whispers of trees,
silent sentinels,
robed in white,
waiting for the return of the sun.

In this silence,
I find clarity,
my tears turned to icicles,
more beautiful in their stillness,
more precious in their solitude.


- Czesław Miłosz
