Moonlit Lake  
  
  
The moonlight shaves the lake to glass,  
A mirror of the sky's own dreams;  
In ripples soft, the stars cascade,  
In silence deep, the evening beams.  
  
Where shadows blend with silver light,  
And every wave a sigh of night,  
I trace the lines of nature's heart,  
In every glimmer, pure delight.  
  
O tranquil water, sweet embrace,  
You hold the night in shimmering peace;  
In your reflection, lost I find,  
The beauty of this world, my lease.

- EJ Pratt
