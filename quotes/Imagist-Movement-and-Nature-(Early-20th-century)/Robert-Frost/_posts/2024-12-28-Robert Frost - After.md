After Apple-Picking

My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still,
And there's a barrel that I didn't fill
Beside it, and there may be two or three
Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.

But I am done with apple-picking now.
Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.

I cannot shake the horror of the night
With it’s apple-flavored memories.
I feel the clay—not touch—it is already bright.

It is good to know the apples wait for me,
That I can pick while they are still on the ground.
And when I glance up there, I know them still,
With heavy, white frost, and thought of their purpose.

- Robert Frost
