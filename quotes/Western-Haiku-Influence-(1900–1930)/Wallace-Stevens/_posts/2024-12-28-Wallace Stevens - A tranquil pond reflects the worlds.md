quote: "A tranquil pond reflects the world’s repose,
Ripples dance in a delicate ballet.
The heart of nature beats in subtle tones,
Each kiss of the breeze a soft goodbye,
To the fleeting hour that spins through stillness."

A tranquil pond reflects the world’s repose,
Ripples dance in a delicate ballet.
The heart of nature beats in subtle tones,
Each kiss of the breeze a soft goodbye,
To the fleeting hour that spins through stillness.
