A Night Thought

There is a Mountain and a Brook,
A pleasant and a retired spot,
Out of the way, I will not look
For you to see, my thoughts are not.

But ion a night
the stars will weep
And each a light like shining leaves
And, as I look upon their sweep,
A dark-haired onyx often grieves.

The sober shadows shuffle by,
There is a whisper on the leaves,
As thinking of my time gone by,
My fortune's breath the river weaves.

Give me to muse, and when I'm steeped
In moonlight that's not live, but raw,
From my own depths the mind has leaped
To seek, unveil, and catalog.

- Dorothy Wordsworth
