The Call of the Crows  
Over fields and down the lane,  
the crows call out,  
their voices seldom plain.  
In rustling reeds,  
at the river's bend,  
a chorus of whispers  
where the wild paths wend.  
They soar above me,  
a dance in the sky,  
a reminder of freedom  
where the earth meets the high.

- Carl Robert Jakobson
