The Morning Dew
Awake, as joy doth seek and find,  
The gentle morn's embrace;  
Each dew-drop clings in joy-defined,  
To every blossomed face.  
The flowers answer soft and sweet  
To heaven’s loving grace,  
As sunlight, glancing at their feet,  
Doth show the earth's new place.

The hues arise, with waking sigh,  
Where every petal gleams,  
And nature paints the azure sky  
With wishes and with dreams,  
In morning's tender light, with flight  
We breathe in harmony,  
For all the world is made so bright  
With spring’s soft symphony.

- Charlotte M Smith
