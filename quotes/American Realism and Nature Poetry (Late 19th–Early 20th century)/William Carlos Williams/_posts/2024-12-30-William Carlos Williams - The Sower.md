The Sower

The sower

is out,
the sun

Raised from the night

still blinks at him

in golden season.

Sweetest earth!

and flowery grass; 

The small
flowers, perfect

and pale, 

are dotted
like spindles

about his toes.

Cheers! the seeds

fall free—and fly
to the fields.

O, to be

young 

as rain

of the flowers!

- William Carlos Williams
