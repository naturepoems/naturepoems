The Song of the Toad

O fat and drowsy fellow,
  That croaks beside the fall,
In joyful tones you sing your songs,
  Amidst the lily's thrall.

Your voice is rich in echoes bright,
  Each note a timid breath;
Yet in the moon's embrace at night,
  You challenge life and death.

So croak and sing, sweet friend of mine,
  For nature's heart is true;
In every whisper of the wind,
  Lies love, born anew.


- Mary Gilmore
