Whispers of the Meadow

In the heart of the meadow,
Where wild grasses sway,
I find the quiet whispers,
Of the earth's gentle secrets,
In the hum of nature's breath.

Butterflies dance like dreams,
Kissing the blooms so sweet,
While the sun weaves its warmth,
Painting shadows that stretch,
Across the tapestry of life.

Here, amidst the colors,
My spirit finds its song,
An hymn to the beauty,
Of all that surrounds me,
In the embrace of the wild.

- Konstantīns Raudive
