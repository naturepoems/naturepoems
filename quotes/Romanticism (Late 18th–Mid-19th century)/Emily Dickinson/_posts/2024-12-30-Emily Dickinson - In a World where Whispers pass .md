In a World where Whispers pass –  
And thoughts are Mighty too –  
And all the Beauty known to Nature –  
Came from, a heart, there too –  

Was all the wildest Music heard –  
In all the Wood and Vale –  
And Nature breathed, a jewel there –  
With all her Hoops, as pale –  

A Lark did sing – A dream, so pure –  
Was wafted from the Ground –  
When every footstep, every word –  
The Harmony I found –  

In Nature’s Rim would play –  
And spin a brighter day –  
Till all the Light, and, in her eye,  
In every moment lay –  

So still there is, and will abide—  
The Nature around me –  
An essence that never returned,  
Yet sensed as beauty –  

That offered every place in Time  
With Light of what I say –  
A world, that gives its Beauty –  
For those who rooted, fast – away!

- Emily Dickinson
