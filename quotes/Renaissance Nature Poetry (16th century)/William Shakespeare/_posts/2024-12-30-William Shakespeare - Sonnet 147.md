Let me not be inconstant, thus your lover,
But when I look all over the adored ground
And see each flower and bush around,
I feel necks ache and levels fall beneath.
   On both sides, an unseen force
   Reaches out to draw me towards your place,
   Calling me softly, yet fierce, to my own source.

   The stars stride in their paths so free,
   Yet they speak no words in their arcane ways,
   So tender love has weight, starlight is merely a guide,
   When you call they can bear me up,
   No earthly ties can hold my aching heart:—
   On the ground, flowers bend beneath your door.

— Sonnet 147

- William Shakespeare
