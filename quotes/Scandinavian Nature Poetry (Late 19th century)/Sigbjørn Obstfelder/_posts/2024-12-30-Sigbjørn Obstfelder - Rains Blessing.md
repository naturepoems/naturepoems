Softly the rain falls, a tender caress,
Each drop a whispered blessing from above;
It nourishes the earth, brings life anew,
Awakens the flowers we cherish and love.

In this delicate dance of water and light,
A symphony plays, both humble and grand;
From the depths of the soil to the heights of the trees,
All of nature awakens, at life’s gentle hand.

- Sigbjørn Obstfelder
