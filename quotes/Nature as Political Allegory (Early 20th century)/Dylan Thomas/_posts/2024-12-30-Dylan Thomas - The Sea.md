The sea is a limitless, bright blue stretch of water,
Coolness everywhere in sight,
Infinite horizons we will never frame in words,
The wind sweeps across the surface,
Moving lightly over the waves,
As the stars drop from the sky at dawn,
Falling into the deep.

And always the silent talk bounces along,
Echoing your laughter through the caves,
Where the shell gathers, and fishes dive
Into shadows of laughter at play,
In the days of sun and moon above.

- Dylan Thomas
