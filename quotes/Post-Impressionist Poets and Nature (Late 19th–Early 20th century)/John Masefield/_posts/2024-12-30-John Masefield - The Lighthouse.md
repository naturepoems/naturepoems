The Lighthouse

A beacon aloft in restless seas,
Rise, lighthouse!  Stand firm with grace,
As storms approach with angry breeze;
Guide sailors to a saving place.

Their cries aloft, your starlight’s due,—
Cloaked shadows tremble at your beam,
While souls en route find strength in you
To navigate within the dream.

- John Masefield
