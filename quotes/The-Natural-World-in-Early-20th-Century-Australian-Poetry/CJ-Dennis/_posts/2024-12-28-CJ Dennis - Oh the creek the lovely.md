Oh, the creek, the lovely creek,
Where the tall trees shade and darken,
Where the dappled ripple gurgles sweet,
And the wildflowers bloom and harken!

There's a whispering in the leaves so fair,
And the soft breeze carries a secret song,
While the morning mist clings tender there,
To the earth where the ferns belong.

In this tranquil spot, I find my peace,
As the world beyond rushes and raves;
The calm of nature brings release,
Where I can find my solace, and be brave.
