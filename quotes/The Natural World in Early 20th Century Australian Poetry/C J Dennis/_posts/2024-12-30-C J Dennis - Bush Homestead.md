In the bush, where the shadows grow long,
There’s a sweet little homestead, where the crooning doves song;
Oh! the roses have blossomed, oh! the fruit-trees are fine,
And the joy of the earth is the world’s and all mine.

I can hear the soft whisper of the limitless woods,
As they murmur out love to the wandering floods,
Every leaf is a ledger, with a tale of the sun,
And the skies are the pages, where the story is spun.


- C J Dennis
