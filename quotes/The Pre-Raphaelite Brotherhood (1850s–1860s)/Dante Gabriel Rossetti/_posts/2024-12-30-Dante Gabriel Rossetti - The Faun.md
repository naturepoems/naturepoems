The Faun

In the cool glades where faded colors bathe,
  in a water-dropped sweat entwined across
  mid wild blooms the Faun, unthought hath stayed,
  clasping his nymph—the morning’s light across.

Soft honeysuckle’s trailing bounty weeps,
  nightshade clings with illumination rare,
  and drowsy dreams tune prayerfully in heaps,
  like wind-wrought whispers curling through the air.

With contented murmurs do they chromatic dwell,
  as they eye each other; meet, follow thus,
  each gaze hungering past entwined revels swell,
  under soft petals to share a turn’s’ touch.

For love there prays, they pass spun flowers, air,
  dance ‘tween day and night, as only nature dares.


- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
