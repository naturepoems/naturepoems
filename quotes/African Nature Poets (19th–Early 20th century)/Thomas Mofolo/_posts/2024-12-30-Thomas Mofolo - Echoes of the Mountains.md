In the shadows of the mountains vast,  
Where time stands still and echoes last,  
Nature whispers secrets, deep and profound,  
In this sacred space, my heart is found.

Among the stones, the rivers weave,  
A narrative of life that we believe,  
In the songs of the earth, a legacy flows,  
In nature's story, our spirit grows.

- Thomas Mofolo
