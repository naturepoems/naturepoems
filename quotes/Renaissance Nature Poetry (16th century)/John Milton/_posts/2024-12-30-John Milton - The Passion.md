The Passion
A sacred day on which the skies grew dark,
And nature sighed, her heart lit like a spark,
For in such pain she felt the world’s great loss,
When man did tread on beauty, love, and cross.
The trees bore witness, and the stones did speak,
As nature wept for all her children weak,
Let love unite us in this pain profound,
In every living thing, creation’s sound.

- John Milton
