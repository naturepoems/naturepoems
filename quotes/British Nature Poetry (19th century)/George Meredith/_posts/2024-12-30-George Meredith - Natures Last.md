Nature's Last
When I stand within the forest,
O Angel, thou hast given true,
What hands can touch which two might touch,
And stand before the sun anew.
\nBut here thy watch or fate is bound:
This little space is torn from strife,
The loving lips can kiss again
And talk of life, of love, of life!
\nFor here no voice, no sign are ours,
Into the woods the shadow goes,
Yet drowsily we make respect
Of sun and moon with hearts like those.
\nOn with thy work—there's life,
There’s birth, and life to carry on;
As once again the cords are bound,
Yours is its fate, yours a song.

- George Meredith
