The Possum

Little possum, soft and sweet,
  Hidden in a tree,
Peeping out with shining eyes
  Happy as a bee.

Do not fear the night and dark,
  For the moon will keep you bright;
In the forest's verdant heart,
  Dance till morning light.

As the shadowed stars unfold
  And the winds begin to sigh,
May your dreams be ever bold,
  Underneath the sky.


- Mary Gilmore
