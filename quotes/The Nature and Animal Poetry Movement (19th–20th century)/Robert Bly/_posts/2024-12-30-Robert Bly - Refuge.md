Refuge

In this sacred place of green,  
I find my spirit resting,  
The calmness of the leaves  
Sings its softest song to me—  
Each breeze, a caress,  
As sunlight dances over the ground.

The silence here resounds,  
Where I can breathe deeply,  
The vibrant life around,  
Reminds me of my roots,  
The wildflowers bloom,  
And I am home, at one with this earth.


- Robert Bly
