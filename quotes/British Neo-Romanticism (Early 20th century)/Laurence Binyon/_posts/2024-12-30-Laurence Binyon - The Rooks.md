The Rooks

In the evening stillness,  
   0, when the rooks fly home,  
The shadows kindle in the tree-tops,  
    As twilight softly spreads,  
And day is done.  

When the white stars shimmer,  
   And shadows deepen in the grove;  
Then all the life of day is fled,  
   And all the leaves are still.  

â€“ Laurence Binyon
