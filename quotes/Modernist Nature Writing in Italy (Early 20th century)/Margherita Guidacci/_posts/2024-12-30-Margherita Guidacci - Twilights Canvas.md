The evening sky,
blushing in amber hues,
paints the world softly,
a canvas where dreams drift.

Beneath this dome,
a hush falls,
kindling a hidden flame,
where twilight gathers thoughts
and ignites the whispers of the world,
nature's way of saying goodbye
before the stars take their watch.

- Margherita Guidacci
