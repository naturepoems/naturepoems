The stars are wild and flaming bright,
They sprinkle dreams across the night,
With every twinkle, every gleam,
They weave the fabric of a dream.
The moonlight glows, a silver hue,
To light the paths we wander through,
And life, beneath the heavens wide,
Is but a joy we’ll never hide.

- Joyce Kilmer
