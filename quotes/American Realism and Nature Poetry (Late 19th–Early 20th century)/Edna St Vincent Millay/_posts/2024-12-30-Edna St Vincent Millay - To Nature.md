I will not be the first to part
From you, dear Nature, Mother Art;
The trees that bend and sway and dance—  
I hold within my heart the chance.

I feel the dew upon my skin,
The wind that whispers round the glen;
In every flower, a gentle sprout,
Nature’s heart, without a doubt.


- Edna St Vincent Millay
