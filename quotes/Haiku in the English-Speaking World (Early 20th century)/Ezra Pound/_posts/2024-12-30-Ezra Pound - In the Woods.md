In the Woods
A spirit walks,
In rustling leaves,
That sound the whole clear
Footsteps in the dusk.

Who walks there? Who walks there?
Have pity upon the earth,
The children on the growh,
In the softness of the glened light.

A tree breaks silence,
If a shadow's undrape
Somewhere a blossom waits,
Until the sound stops!


- Ezra Pound
