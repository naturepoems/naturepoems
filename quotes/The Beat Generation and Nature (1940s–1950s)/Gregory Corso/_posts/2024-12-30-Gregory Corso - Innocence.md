Innocence
by Gregory Corso

The field of grasses
dances on its tail.
And the wildflowers,
in a state of frenzy,
rise green-stemmed and proud.
The hidden insects chant,
like soft drummers,
and the earth breathes,
inhales the blue spaces,
each flower a note,
freely singing life,
of the great light!

I listen while deception
holds my bated breath,
I hold out my arms
as if to catch,
what is left of the insane sky,
a pocketful of blessings,
This was once,
every ounce of innocence pursued,
wild with laughter,
untouched by time.

- Gregory Corso
