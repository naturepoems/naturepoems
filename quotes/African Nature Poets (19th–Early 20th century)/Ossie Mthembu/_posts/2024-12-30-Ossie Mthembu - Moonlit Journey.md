Moonlit Journey

Underneath the silver moon,
The night holds a secret path,
Through whispers of the trees,
And the gentle aftermath.

The shadows weave a tale,
Of adventures yet to come,
In the stillness of the night,
The world beats like a drum.

Nature, a map unfurled,
Guides the wanderer's heart,
In the moon's embrace, they dance,
As the night plays its part.

- Ossie Mthembu
