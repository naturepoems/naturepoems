Spring Awakens

Amid the thaw of winter's embrace,
   As whispers of green begin to unfold,
Spring awakens with a gentle grace,
   Rebirth of life in hues of gold.

The crocus peeks from shrouded earth,
   Its petals singing, 'Here I am!'
Life returns, a joyful mirth,
   In every bud, the springtime's plan.

The melody of birds fills the air,
   A chorus sweet, the sweetest creed,
In every note, the world laid bare,
   Spring awakens, and hearts are freed.

- AJM Smith
