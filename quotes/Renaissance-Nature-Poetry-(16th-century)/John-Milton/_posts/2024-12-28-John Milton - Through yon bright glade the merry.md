Through yon bright glade, the merry brook doth flow,
Singing its way, where wildflowers', gleam aglow.
Here Love's gentle whisper paints all things bright,
While shadows but deepen the wonder of light.
From the mountains' peaks the vast world reflects, 
In Nature's pure heart, the kindness connects.

- John Milton
