The mountains rise high, kissed by clouds like dear friends,  
Their summits stand timeless, where silence transcends.  
In the shadows of giants, my spirit ascends,  
Brushed by the whispers of Nature that never end.  

Each rock tells a story, each stone, a refrain,  
In the vivid embrace of the soft falling rain;  
A symphony echoes, a world intertwined,  
Where the pulse of the earth beckons a heart so refined.  

Let me climb through the valleys, let me breath in the air,  
For Nature awakens a bond that we share;  
With mountains so regal, I learn to be free,  
In the arms of creation, eternally me.

- Marcel Proust
