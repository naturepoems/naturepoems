Rain over the trees,
A shiver of silver,
Till veil of the mist
Is folded away.
And out through the boughs
A rending of gold
Dissolves in a shower
With the thunder’s applause.

I hear in the spaces,
An echo of silence,
Trembling beneath,
Like a flutter of wings.
Will the sun burst forth
In a shimmering laugh,
Or will the shadow stay
As the night falls down?

- Emily Carr
