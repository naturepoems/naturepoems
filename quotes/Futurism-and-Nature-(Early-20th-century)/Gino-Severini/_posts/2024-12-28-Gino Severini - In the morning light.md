In the morning light, 
splashes of color break 
a new day—the sky, 
delicate and clear, 
a canvas for the sun’s brush.

Leaves flutter like thoughts, 
ideas that dance in the wind, 
and every blooming flower 
sings of vibrant lives lived.

The rushing river, 
a throbbing pulse, 
carves through the earth, 
a testament to time— 
the eternal artist
at work.

- Gino Severini
