Of Mere Being

The palm stands on the edge of space,  
The palm stands on the edge of space,  
In a single, rich green frond,  
A universe is complete,  
And we search for meaning.

Here, we may observe in silence,  
The moments arise, in view,  
The closest aspect of the mind.  
The palm not adjusted, no entrance,
It is enough—the very essence  
Of Being.  
And at the end of things,  
We are defined—we can remember.

- Wallace Stevens
