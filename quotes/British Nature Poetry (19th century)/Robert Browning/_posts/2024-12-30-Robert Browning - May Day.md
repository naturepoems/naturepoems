There’s a lovely thing in May;
   I long for its glory,
What splendor springs to play!
   A tale of nature’s story.
When fields are bright as candy fair,
   And dances by the brook,
The lilac and the brand new air,
   My heart is lost in its book!
A glimpse of loveliness explains
   Why nature’s mad with flight,
Why colors blush and songs of rain
   Shatter the dark of night.

- Robert Browning
