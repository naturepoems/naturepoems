The Delights of Nature

Amid the green of summer's sheen,
Where winds are soft, and flowers beam;
In every scent that floats between,
A thousand dreams are born and seem
To speak of joys long lost or gained,
Where beauty wraps its gentle bands,
In nature's gilded charm constrained,
Hidden from eyes that roam the lands.
Her pulse of life, untamed yet pure,
Awakens wishes, wild and true,
Let every heart attune, assure,
That blessing glows for me and you.
