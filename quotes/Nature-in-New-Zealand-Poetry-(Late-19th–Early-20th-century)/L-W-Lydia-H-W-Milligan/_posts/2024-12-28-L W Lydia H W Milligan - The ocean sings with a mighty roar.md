The ocean sings with a mighty roar,  
Its waves crash on the shore,  
Each rhythm speaks of journeys made  
And the dreams we dare explore.  

Seagulls cry, their wings outstretched,  
Guiding ships to where they roam,  
The vastness of the restless sea,  
Becomes a sailor's home.

- L W Lydia H W Milligan
