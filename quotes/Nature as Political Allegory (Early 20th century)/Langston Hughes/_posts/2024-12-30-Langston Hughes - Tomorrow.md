Tomorrow

I see the rivers flowing,
The whispers of thick trees;
I see the night thorns arise,
And the morning sun rise anew.

Rivers flow forever,
Vasting deep, winding round,
And they will tell you all secrets,
In every soft, murmuring sound.

And tomorrow will show us,
What we ought to be—
Our fields of green alive, and
The harvest of hope shines bright!

With smiles and laughter, we shall walk,
Knowing freedom reigns, for they shall thrive,
As the earth itself beneath our feet, reminding us,
Of hands that owned its reward.

—Langston Hughes
