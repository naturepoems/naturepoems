Two Stories
I think I shall go away today.
It rains,
and water hurls it down,
a trickle beside the drain leads off,
synced voices dissecting nature.
Into the gardenâ€™s clamored silence,
verging on the bodied green,
where twisted sedge and foam-touched eyes are,
nature knows its mercurial friends,
and hanging lotus:
Who sings to the long-flung shadows,
wake up! wake up through what is night!

- Mina Loy
