A Miracle for Breakfast

Each morning, looking out
upon the roof tops,
shining ever white in the rising light,
the sun’s narrow fingers settle
on each turn of the spiral
along every branch,
every twinkling blossom,
while the lost sun,
wonders, searching within it’s high glass cage
and keeping peering down,
at the pause of chance and wonder,
as each glimmer of detail
hangs weightless and unnoticed.
