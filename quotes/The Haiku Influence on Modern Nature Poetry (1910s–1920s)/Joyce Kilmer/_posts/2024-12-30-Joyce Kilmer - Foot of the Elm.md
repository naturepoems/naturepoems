---

At the foot of a great elm tree,  
I feel my heart can soar  
To the quiet whispering winds,  
And the earth can offer more.  

Among the rustling leaves I find  
A calmness and a breath;  
The dancing shadows play, behind  
This slender trunk of death.  

Yet from the bark twine leaves still grow  
And blossoms start anew;  
Above me, ever green, they show  
The life that’s ever true.

- Joyce Kilmer
