Across the Plains
The grass that sweeps to the mountains,
The wiry trees that sway,  
Where the wildflowers are scattered,
In the softness of breaking day.

The whistling winds that greet me,
With a wanderer's song in their breath,  
A trotting path with memories,
Where the echoes of life find depth.

- Dorothea Mackellar
