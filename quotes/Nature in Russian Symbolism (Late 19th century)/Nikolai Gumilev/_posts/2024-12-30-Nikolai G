In spring, the earth awakes,
With bursts of color breaking forth,
Each bloom a proclamation,
Of renewal, of rebirth,
As warmth caresses the soil's embrace.

Birds return to sing their tunes,
A celebration of life returned,
Nature paints her canvas bright,
With every petal unfolding,
A reminder of hope's constant whisper.

- Nikolai Gumilev
