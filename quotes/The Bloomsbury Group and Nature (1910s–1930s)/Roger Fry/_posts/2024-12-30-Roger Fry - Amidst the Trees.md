Amidst the trees, where shadows weave,
 The laughter in the air believes.
 The quiet song of nature’s choir,
 Inspires the soul, ignites the fire.

 In every raindrop, gold and blue,
 In sunlit rays that break right through,
 The beauty of this world so fine,
 Is captured in a fleeting line.


- Roger Fry
