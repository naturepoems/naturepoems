Spring and All

By the road to the contagious hospital

under the surge of the blue

mottled clouds

a red wheel

barrow

crosses

the muddy

plowed land

and the grass

hangs

with the rain

and the world

is almost still

yet a symbol of

the so-called

new life.

Things change

and yet they do not

- William Carlos Williams
