The Canvas of Spring

Awakening from slumber,
the earth shakes off the shroud,
blossoms explode in vividness,
a carnival of colors unfurling.
Born anew, the world rejoices,
spirits converge in jubilance,
as the fragrance of promise
denotes the season of life.

Each bud breaks the silence,
a testament to resilience.
The symphony of birdsong rises,
a melody of rebirth;
young ones take flight,
eager to imprint their dreamsâ€”
a celebration of existence, a vibrant echo.

Nature invites us,
join this cycle,
a canvas painted in wild abandon,
and rejoice in the magic of our moments.


- Umberto Boccioni
