From The Other Side

There is a spectrum
   of light in the darkness
where the world breathes
   in silence.
Through every entrance,
a memory of water
     flows between the trees.

As you lust for what is lost
   know that nothing ever
   truly disappears,
but lingers just beyond
     the corner of your eye.


- W S Merwin
