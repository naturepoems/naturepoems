Oh, for a draught of vintage! that hath been  
Cool’d a long age in the deep-delved earth,  
Tasting of Flora and the country green,  
Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!  
     O for a beaker full of the warm South,  
Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,  
With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,  
And purple-stained mouth;  
That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,  
And with thee fade away into the forest dim:  
     Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget  
What thou among the leaves hast never known,  
     The weariness, the fever, and the fret  
Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;  
Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,  
     Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;  
     Where but to think is to be full of sorrow  
And leaden-eyed despairs,  
     Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,  
     Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.  
     O for a beaker full of the warm South,  
Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,  
With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,  
And purple-stained mouth;  
That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,  
And with thee fade away into the forest dim.

- John Keats
