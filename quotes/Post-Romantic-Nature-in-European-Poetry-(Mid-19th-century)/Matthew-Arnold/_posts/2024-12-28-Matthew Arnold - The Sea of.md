The Sea of Faith

O me! O life! of the questions of these recurring;  
Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill'd with the foolish;  
What good amid these, O me, O life?  
Answer. That you are here—that life exists, and identity;  
That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.  

For the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.  

A dream of dreams!  

But as I walk through the wilderness of this world,  
I take my way, 'tis against the sound of the ocean,  
A breath as soft as any evening sky  
Will kiss me down, and I will not sigh,  
But sing my place into the brighter day.

So farewell earth,  
What a house of a thousand leaves,  
Sea-waves and striding  
Clouds interleaved like halos,  
What a grace in the sun writ who knows to run for!  
You will cry—forever clutched in me—my pure place in the universe.

- Matthew Arnold
