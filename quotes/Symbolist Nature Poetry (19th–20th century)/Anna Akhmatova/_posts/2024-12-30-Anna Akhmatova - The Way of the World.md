The Way of the World

The silence of the autumn garden,
The light that falls on golden leaves,
The life that ebbs and flows like rivers,
These things are all I have to grieve.

The swallows in their evening flight
That circle and that wheel above,
Will call me to their distant home,
To breathe again, to sing of love.


- Anna Akhmatova
