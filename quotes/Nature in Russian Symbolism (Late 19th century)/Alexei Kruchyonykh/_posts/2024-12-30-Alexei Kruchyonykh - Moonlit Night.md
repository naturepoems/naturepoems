Moonlit Night
Beneath the moon’s soft glow, the world appears,
A landscape of dreams, silencing fears.
Silver beams cascade through branches bare,
In the quiet night, magic hangs in the air.

Stars sprinkle wisdom, ancient and bright,
Guiding the wanderer lost in the night.
Nature’s lullaby, soft as a sigh,
In the stillness, the soul learns to fly.

- Alexei Kruchyonykh
