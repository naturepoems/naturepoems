When twilight paints the sky with fire,
And whispers wind 'neath willow trees,
I feel the stars pull me higher,
Their ancient light, a whispered breeze.

Each petal kissed by evening dew,
A tapestry of night embraced,
In nature's heart, my spirit grew,
In shadowed paths, my fears are chased.

- Vanessa Bell
