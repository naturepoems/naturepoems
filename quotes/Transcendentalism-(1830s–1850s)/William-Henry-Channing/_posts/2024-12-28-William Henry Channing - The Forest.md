The Forest  
 
In the depth of woodlands vast,  
Where the sighing trees have cast  
Shadows deep and whispers low,  
Nature's secrets freely flow.  

Listen to the babbling stream,  
Feel the sunlight’s gentle beam;  
Every rustle, every sound,  
Speaks of life, profound, unbound.

- William Henry Channing
