The wind carries stories of lands far and wide,
Sifting through trees with the grace of a guide.
In its breath, I hear echoes of millions who came,
In nature’s grand chorus, we’re all part of the same.

From mountain to valley, through every terrain,
The pulse of the planet beats deep in my vein.
In this interconnected web, I find redemption,
In the heart of nature lies my heart’s intention.
