Nature is the art of God.
There’s sunlight on the river,
A shadow on the hill,
The wind it whispers softly
And life is never still.

The blossom bursts forth brightly,
Its fragrance fills the air,
The birds sing out their verses,
A song without compare.

So let us roam in nature,
Where beauty’s always found;
The glory of creation
Is waiting all around.

- Charles Lane
