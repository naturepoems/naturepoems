The Flower

In gardens framed of blooming light,
Where petals open, trace the sight,
A chorus rises, true and sweet,
Each flower a heartbeat, a life complete.

From golden crowns and hues of red,
To violets dropping where I tread,
The palette spreads and bends my mind,
In every bloom, a soul defined.

Among their ranks, I find my peace,
As scents entwine, and tensions cease,
With every ray that softly kissed,
In nature's hands, there's nothing missed.

- Dorothy Wordsworth
