Autumn Leaves  
Fallen leaves whisper tales as they dance to the ground,  
In hues of gold, where silence is found;  
The trees stand bare, yet their spirits remain,  
In the crisp autumn air, they endure all the pain.
 
The wind’s gentle fingers comb through the branches,  
Caressing the remnants, where sunlight enhances;  
While the earth takes a breath, in a moment of grace,  
For soon winter’s chill will embrace this place.
 
Yet in the decay, there’s life to be seen,  
In the cycle of seasons, where beauty is gleaned;  
For autumn’s soft sigh is a promise, sure,  
That spring will uncoil and life will endure.

- Frank Norris
