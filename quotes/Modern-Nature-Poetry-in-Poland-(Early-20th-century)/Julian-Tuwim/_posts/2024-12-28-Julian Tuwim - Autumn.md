Autumn
Crisp leaves crunch beneath my feet,
a symphony of colors in retreat.
Golden hues ablaze,
each tree a sentinel of change,
as they shed their cloaks,
eager for winter's embrace.
The air is filled with a sweet decay,
a promise of renewal waits,
for all that fades must reappear,
in a dance of time and fate.


- Julian Tuwim
