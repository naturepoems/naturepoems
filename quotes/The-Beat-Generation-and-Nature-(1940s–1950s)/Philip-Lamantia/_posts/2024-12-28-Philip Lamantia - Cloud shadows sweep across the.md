Cloud shadows sweep across the land,
Lost in echoes that fate has planned,
Whispers of the earth, rising high,
In the depths of silence, the night-birds cry.

The elms’ embrace, a sacred trust,
They sketch the skyline, in dusk we rust.
And through the patterns of life in bloom,
A darkened thought will find its room.
