REFLECTIONS  

O, gentle world! beneath the shade,  
Where silence reigns, and whispers dwell;  
I pause to rest, as light has made  
A canvas spread with dream to tell.  

The clouds above, like treasures rare,  
Where gold and silver cross the ray;  
Bring wisdom, grace, and beauty rare,  
And life flows through, like night to day.  

So let me linger, lost in thought,  
And feel the natureâ€™s warm embrace;  
For here, my guru nourished brought,  
A peace that shadows not efface.  


- Lydia Huntley Sigourney
