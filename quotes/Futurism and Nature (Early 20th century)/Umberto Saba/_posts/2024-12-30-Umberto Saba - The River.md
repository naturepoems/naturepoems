The river flows, a silver thread,
Weaving through the fabric of the land,
Its voice a melody, sweet and constant,
Reflecting skies, dreams, and the passing of time.

Beneath its surface, life dances,
Fish darting in a balletic swirl,
The soft kiss of the water,
A caress that carries secrets,
Stories untold, drifting downstream.

On its banks, the flowers bloom,
Bright hues in vibrant contrast,
A canvas painted with natureâ€™s hand,
Each petal a brushstroke of beauty,
Each stem a testament to hope.

- Umberto Saba
