Starlight

Under the cloak of starlit night,
I wander 'neath the cosmic dance,
Where constellations weave tales of old,
Threads of light binding earth and sky,
It's there, beneath the expansive void,
I witness the delicate balance of life—
For in starlight's glow, even shadows rejoice,
A reminder that the smallest spark ignites the soul.
