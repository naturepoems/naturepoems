In the garden where twilight begins to rest,
Where rose petals meet with the sun’s golden quest,
I watch as the flowers yield secrets of time,
In the cradle of silence, so pure and sublime.
Oh blissful moment, where colors entwine,
In this embrace, all of nature is mine,
Beyond the night’s curtain, lies a dream ever free,
As flashes of beauty unfold, come dance with me!

- Arthur Rimbaud
