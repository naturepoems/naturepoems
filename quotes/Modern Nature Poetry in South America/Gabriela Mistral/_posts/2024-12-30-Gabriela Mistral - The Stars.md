The Stars

When luminous petals  
shine upon the night,  
I give thanks to roots  
for the dreams anew.  

Twinkling coveted beams,  
where laments dance raw,  
a quiet starry pace  
shares its gentle frolic.  

A moment's interlude  
gathers the sky awash â€”  
through fragrant wings of what  
dreams veer and remain.  

Onwards I pray the way  
that ends in howling light  
into the folds of life  
at magical horizons.

- Gabriela Mistral
