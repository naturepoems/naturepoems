Whispers of the Wind  
The wind did whisper through the trees,  
And carry forth the tales of ease,  
Of sun-kissed hills and glistening streams,  
Of autumn’s hues and summer’s dreams.  

It scattered leaves upon the ground,  
A symphony of colors found;  
In every rustle, every sigh,  
The echoes of the earth's sweet cry.
