Full Moon and Little Frieda

I

The whole earth is a poem,
Of the wordless and the imageless.
Nightâ€™s air made clear,
And there is something watching,
Like a little girl, listening.

II

Below a full moon,
A loud shriek silenced, the trees,
Sees a vibrant tremor, and the moon moves,
Brightly aware of this girl and the storm.

- Ted Hughes
