Good Fences Make Good Neighbors
Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
And spills the upper boulders in the sun;
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.
The work of hunters is another thing:
I have come after them and made repair
Where they have left not one stone on a stone,
But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,
To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,
No one has seen them made or heard them made,
But at spring mending-time we find them there.

I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;
And on a day we meet to walk the line
And set the wall between us once again.
We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
Oh, just another kind of outdoor game,
One on a side. It comes to little more:
There where it is we do not need the wall:
He is all pine and I am apple orchard.

My apple trees will never get across
And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.
He only says, "Good fences make good neighbors." 

Springs, if you don’t know, hate the walls:
So should you let them out or wrench them in?
When the frost lifts, the frozen ground will ease
With every wall down every year. I say,
Not that the order was decided last,
Just that it doesn't keep men from each other; 
I mean if only that they knew they could care.

Just that it made the fence mean more—not less,
Just not to stare at blights, just underneath them:
There where we can taste of what is flowing free,
The one of watchful hearts and caring hands to guide.
