Oh! The golden summer skies,
   The ripening harvests on the plains,
The clear blue hills, where sunshine lies,
   And peace is breathed in fragrant rains.

When all the realms of nature sing,
   From vale to mountain’s towering shine,
Elysium dreams in everything,
   Until with joy my heart’s entwined.

- John Clare
