Awake, my soul, from slumber deep,
To witness nature's grand display;
The hills that tower, the forests steep,
In every leaf, a story’s sway.

For here in every shade and light,
The essence of the earth unfolds;
Among the flowers, pure delight,
In harmony, each moment holds.

So take my hand, O gentle breeze,
And guide me where the rivers flow;
For here in nature's heart, I seize,
The blessings life has come to show!

- George Gordon Byron
