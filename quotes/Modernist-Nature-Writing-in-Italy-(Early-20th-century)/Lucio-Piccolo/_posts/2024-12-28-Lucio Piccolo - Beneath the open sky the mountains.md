Beneath the open sky, the mountains rise,
towering sentinels in their green attire,
clad in tales spun of wind and stone,
a ragged chorus of old gods still singing.

The path winds thin, among bracken and heather,
and I follow the call of the lark,
a sweet note soaring through the canvas of dawn,
a clarion of natureâ€™s unbroken promise.

Above, a cloud drifts, hesitant,
a solitary sailor on a sea of blue,
their silken sails brushing the edges of dreams,
as I pause in the shadow of a fir,
a breath caught between heaven and earth.

Will I speak to this world,
this sacred place?
Will it hear my heartbeat,
my longing for the eternal?
I will fold my thoughts in silence,
and let the mountains answer me.

- Lucio Piccolo
