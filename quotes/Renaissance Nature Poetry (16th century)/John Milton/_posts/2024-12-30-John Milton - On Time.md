On Time
Time is a river, in which all that we do,
Is cast upon its currents, clear and true.
Yet nature bides her time that we may learn,
For in her embrace, our wildest dreams return.
The seasons turn, as leaf and bud emerge,
And through this life, we feel the constant urge
To cherish every moment as it flies,
For time, like nature, fades and never lies.

- John Milton
