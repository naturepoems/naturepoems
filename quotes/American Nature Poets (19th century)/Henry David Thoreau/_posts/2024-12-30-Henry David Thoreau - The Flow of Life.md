This river flows strong,
In harmony with land,
Where ripples will sparkle,
In life’s gentle hand,
The wildflowers open—
Their petals unsealed,
And clothe the great banks,
Where all truths revealed.

Songbirds are chirping,
Every note in delight,
Their calls tell a tale,
Of morning's sweet flight,
And here at this moment,
I've tasted what’s real,
In nature’s good heart,
That nothing can steal.

- Henry David Thoreau
