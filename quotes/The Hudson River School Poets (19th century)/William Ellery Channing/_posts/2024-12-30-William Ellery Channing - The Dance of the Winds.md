The winds that dance on fields of grain,  
Caress the thoughts of those who roam,  
In every gust, a sweet refrain,  
Of wanderings, of calling home.  

The whispers through the golden stalks,  
Speak tales of journeys yet to be,  
In every breeze, the spirit walks,  
Wild and free, like the open sea.

- William Ellery Channing
