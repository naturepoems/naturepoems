B\n
On the quiet shores of the sea,
The waves roll like a soothing hymn;
Soft mist weaves through the ocean air,
With the scent of salt and sun.

Birds soar, gliding gracefully free,
Their cries echoing in the blue;
And in the distance, the horizon glows,
A promise of new worlds to pursue.

In this sanctuary of light and sound,
The heart feels at home, unwound;
Nature speaks in silent verse,
Life's mystery, beautifully rehearsed.

- Arthur Rimbaud
