In the Heart of Nature

Amidst the trees where shadows dwell,
The heart of nature begins to swell,
In every rustle and every breeze,
The pulse of life is felt with ease.

A sanctuary where spirits roam,
In the wild, we find our home,
In the symphony of sound and sight,
Nature’s embrace is pure delight.

- David C Okwuosa
