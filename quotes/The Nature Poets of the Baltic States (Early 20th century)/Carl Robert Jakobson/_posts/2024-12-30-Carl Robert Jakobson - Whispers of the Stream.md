Whispers of the Stream  
Through the mountains,  
a silver thread weaves,  
water's sweet song,  
from forest it cleaves.  
It murmurs to stones,  
it dances with light,  
each ripple a tale  
of day and of night.  
Listen, dear soul,  
to the water's refrain,  
in its gentle embrace,  
weâ€™re part of its chain.

- Carl Robert Jakobson
