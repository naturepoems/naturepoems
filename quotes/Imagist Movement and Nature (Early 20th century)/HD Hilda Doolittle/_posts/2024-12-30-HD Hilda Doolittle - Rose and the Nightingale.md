Rose and the Nightingale

O rose,
      you are beautiful,
        beautiful lady,
    that nightingale
    is long in love
        with you.

      When suddenly he breathes
down your scarlet,
        and stills your purple.
    He loves,
        he burns his song
to your sweetness.

- HD Hilda Doolittle
