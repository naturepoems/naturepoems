The storm clouds gather, a blanket gray,  
And the wind begins to moan and sigh;  
The trees bend low to the earth's dismay,  
And the rain will fall from the heavy sky.  

But after the tempest, the world awakes,  
In the light of the sun, with a gentle laugh;  
The leaves will glisten, the earth will shake,  
As life returns to the river's path.

- Ruth Dallas
