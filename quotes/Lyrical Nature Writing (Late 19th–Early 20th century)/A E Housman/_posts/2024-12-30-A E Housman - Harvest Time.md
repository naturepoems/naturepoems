HARVEST TIME

The fields grow rich with autumn’s gleam,  
As bounty fills the farmer’s heart;  
With golden grains that sway and dream,  
The harvest time is set to start.

Let laughter fill the cool, crisp air,  
As hands and hearts unite in cheer;  
For nature’s gift, beyond compare,  
Is whispered softly, year by year.  


- A E Housman
