Upon the lake, the moonlight spills,
Silvered waves that drift and fill.
A tranquil heart, the night so still,
In nature's grasp, our dreams fulfill.

The whispering pines so tall and grand,
Guide the soul to a promised land.
In every leaf, in every strand,
Nature's beauty at our hand.

- Sigrid Unset
