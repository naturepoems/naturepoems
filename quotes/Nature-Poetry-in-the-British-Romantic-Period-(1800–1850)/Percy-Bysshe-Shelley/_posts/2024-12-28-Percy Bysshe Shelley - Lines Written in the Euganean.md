Lines Written in the Euganean Hills
I
The sun is warm, the sky is clear,
The waves are dancing fast and bright,
Blue isles and snowy sails appear,
And men and boats and waves delight.

In this summer sky, and in this flowing sea,
What wonder that the gladness of the heart is free?

II
All things are new; the freshness of the air,  
The glittering sea, the shore-line’s swelling grace—  
Ye nature’s song, unblemished by despair—
Are my repose, are my sweet resting place.

And thus my life keeps time with a signal tune,
Set in a sunny sky’s bright afternoon.


- Percy Bysshe Shelley
