The sun has sunk behind the hill,
And leaves a lighted tale to fill,
Where blooms awake and birds take flight,
To mark the end of fruitful light.

Where shadows cradle branch and tree,
To whisper soft of earthâ€™s decree,
My feet shall tread where nature sings,
In lullabies of gentle springs.

So let me pace beside the brook,
And find the place where echoes look,
For nature ever breathes the love,
Among the hills and skies above.


- AE Housman
