Spring and All
By the road to the contagious hospital
under the surge of the blue
mottled clouds
of the sky
    —brought to machine
    the red wheel
    barrow
    so much depends upon
the white
chickens, and the beautiful
    flush of winter’s
    orchard, is going
    back.


- William Carlos Williams
