To Mr. Lawrence
Lest thou should’st mourn in doubt with crimson shades,
Of violets that bloom beneath the glades,
Or warm the winds that kiss each gentle flower,
The heart finds peace amidst sweet nature’s hour.
With every breath inhale creation’s song,
Let every brook and breeze cast forth along.
For life is tender, rich, and to adore,
In nature’s arms, we live forevermore.

- John Milton
