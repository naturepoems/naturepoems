Ephemeris
by Gregory Corso

I am landing
on a telescope’s gaze,
a peek through sparking time -
ten million years,
a light from the sun
that paints
what came before,
and the moon,
an eye in secret,
gathering stories
to tell the soil,
I whisper echo leads:
each leaf shows me
how to fly,
how childhood dances
down the fading ground.

I am lost more,
when the stars
push behind my ear,
telling me,
'wave your jokes,
unhinge our poisons
each smirk meets any sky.'
I make room for shadows,
letting go where I’ve dived,
I’m never going back.

The earth is this holy trance
of green and blue,
and I chill underneath
the celestial before-mat,
in the fuzzy dusk,
the nature of an evening
kisses my words loose,
I’m gathering waves of time,
a thimble of magic,
a child of stars.

- Gregory Corso
