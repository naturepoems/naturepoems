Above the Trees  
Above the trees,  
I see the sky,  
Kiss that great expanse  
With warmth or chill,  
Where colors change  
As clouds drift by,  
Mimicking the flight of  
Dreams. And under  
The vastness of heavens,  
The sun pulls on shadows  
That dance across the fields,  
This separation is divine.  
A painter’s canvas,  
Every morning invokes  
A new wonder –  
Of what is seen,  
And lost.

- Christopher Isherwood
