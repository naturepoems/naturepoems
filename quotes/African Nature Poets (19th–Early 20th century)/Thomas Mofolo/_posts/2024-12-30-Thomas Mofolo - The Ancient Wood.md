From deep within the ancient wood,  
Where silence speaks and the heart has stood,  
The tales of the ancients, through corridors breathe,  
In the layers of earth, such power beneath.

Branches arch in a welcoming sway,  
As sunlight filters, chasing shadows away,  
In the sanctuary of green, I find my peace,  
In nature’s embrace, all worries cease.

- Thomas Mofolo
