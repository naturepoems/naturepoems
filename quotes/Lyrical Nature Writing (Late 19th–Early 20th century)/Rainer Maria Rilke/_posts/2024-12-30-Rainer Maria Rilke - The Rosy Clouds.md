The Rosy Clouds

O rosy clouds that float
    upon the depths of the blue
    nightly fog of the garden,
    clouded mufflin of life,
    how still and sleepy you are.

    Keep close to the flowers,
    tripping softly, lightly,
    jeweled dew on petal-lined skirts,
    gossamer, childlike spirit,
    running from the wild winds.

—Rainer Maria Rilke
