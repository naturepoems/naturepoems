O fair the mountain's side,
In mists, divinely grey;
As twilight whispers mild,
Kissing the zephyr play.

Within the arms of dusk
Crimson stands the fir,
While glories shining wide
Over the land confer.

From bough to bough the echoes kiss,
While Natureâ€™s choir sings ever on,
Filling the air, the breath of bliss,
In gentle tones till day is gone.

- James Russell Lowell
