The Sea and the Hills
When the sea from the hills clasps the winds of fate,
And dawn turns jubilant on the waters deep;
A new voice awakens from its slumbering state–
The stir of the soul in a heart that will weep.

O tender sky, with the clouds so fair,
The storms of the ocean conspire with the morn,
And nature's vast riddle above us shall stare,
To weave songs of beauty that ne’er can be shorn.
