The Garden

Only in the garden  
can ponders of life be thought.  
Spring intermingles life  
with the repetition of death;  
in spring I hold  
what the garden grants:  
plants awakened,  
freshly freed hearts,  
blossoms no sin could entwine,  
ascending in piece;  
some gardens have broad arms —  
those to keep me yearning above,  
and others create sombre stretches  
that daunt a thirst.

See the whirl,  
the parade of the dead  
filled with joy and  
fulfilled blooms.  
But one asked them  
of their nectar —  
in mundane silk they find  
a lot more stirring.

- Gabriela Mistral
