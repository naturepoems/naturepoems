The Sea in Being

    Waves like stars rolled.
    Not like rainbows, not like snow,  
    Not seamless with the sunset or rising suns.
    But white fire, a swallowing rain-cloud, 
    The dark sometimes hides it,  
    And then it floods with a dull light.

    Pink star-stripes unfurl, unfurled, 
    Twisted around its enormous leviathan,
    The space filled, spilling  
    Wide as the shimmering sea.  

    It is here, in its pulse, a vivacious wave in the silent night,
    Sucking at the shore,
    And from that cover comes the instigation,
    Its own fire expiring as it retreats into a shadow.

    


- Ted Hughes
