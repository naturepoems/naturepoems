The Lake

This is how we draw our witness.
On the horizon, a lake reflects the sky.
The soft blue opens like a quiet mind,
And in its depths a silence seems to lie.

How wonderful is the touch of leaves,
When the wind gently whispers to the trees.
The water laps against the shore’s embrace,
A mirror trembling with the secrets of the breeze.

Here amid the reeds, where lilies bloom,
I dream of days where pulse calls like a drum;
The quiet hum of nature, the sweet perfume,
In these still spaces I am truly home.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
