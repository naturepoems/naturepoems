The time will come, my love, when we
Will part from these sweet woods of green;
And the wild flowers that spread so free,
Will fade like autumn’s dreams unseen.

But in my heart, you live and play,
No shadow shall erase your sway;
Though all the world may wash away,
Our love will bloom, a bright bouquet.


- Edna St Vincent Millay
