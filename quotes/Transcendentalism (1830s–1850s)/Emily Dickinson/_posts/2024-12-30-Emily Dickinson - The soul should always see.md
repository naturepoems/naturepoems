The soul should always see  
That Sacrifices its barest own;  
It must not wander far away  
From Nature’s promises –  

And be a Prince in Hollow Land  
In distances so dense  
But rest, so lost, should find a way  
To reach beyond the Fence –  

But when it does, it grows the World  
That we at times must give  
For charity – to Nature’s God  
For still – it will not live –

- Emily Dickinson
