The way of the wild
Is the way of the free:
Pine-trees, frail and tall,
Waving and beckoning to the sea.
Long and low, the light
Is like a feather,
Floating in the night.
The lake is swirling,
The stars are swimming,
And the wind is singing
The songs of the river.

Hark, meadows, and
Glistening fields;
Every leaf calls,
And every bird yields.
They say the wild
Is a treacherous friend;
But, oh, give me the woods
Until the end!

- Stephen Crane
