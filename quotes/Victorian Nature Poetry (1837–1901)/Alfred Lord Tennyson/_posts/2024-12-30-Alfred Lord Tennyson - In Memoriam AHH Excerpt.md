In Memoriam A.H.H. (Excerpt)  
O dear delight! O rich array!  
Of blooming flowers and fragrant woods,  
O bliss of life, like a summer day,  
With golden sun and silver floods.

So clear the air, so pure the light,  
The fields resound with the lark’s song,  
Each sighing breeze seems to take flight  
With all the melodies of the throng.

There is a beauty none can measure  
In every tree and every flower,  
Each moment a transcendent pleasure,  
That stirs the heart at every hour.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
