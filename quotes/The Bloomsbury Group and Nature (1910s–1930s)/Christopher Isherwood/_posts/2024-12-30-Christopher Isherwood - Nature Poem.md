Nature  
In this light the world  
Is a painted picture,  
The tree trunks swift  
As an actor’s dark  
Paint strokes,  
Lines of hill and vale  
Etched in a great feel,  
And that wind –  
The whisper, the finch,  
And the flutter of the crows  
Above.  

But still the grey-blue clouds  
Draw over, and a dim day,  
As we step quietly  
Into stillness,  
In touch with  
The ancient laurel of  
Life, of root, of flower.  
Our thoughts catch  
Like leaves trapped in  
The underbrush.  
We learn a language  
Of rhythm, a sense of  
Time stretched among  
The shadows of life,  
The silences of existence.  
We dance through the brush,  
We pierce the coolness  
With laughter,  
We turn to the sun  
As longed for,  
And know.

- Christopher Isherwood
