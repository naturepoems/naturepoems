Spring arrives with
a song on its lips,
new life bursting forth,
colors brightening the
earth’s palette,

While buds bloom
and dancers awaken,
the warmth of the sun
is a promise,
every moment
a new beginning.

Nature shimmers,
twinkles in celebration,
a canvas alive—
as if the world
itself has found
its joy again.
