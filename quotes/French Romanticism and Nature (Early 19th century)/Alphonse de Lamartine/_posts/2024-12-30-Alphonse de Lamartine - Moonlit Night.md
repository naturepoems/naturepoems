Moonlit Night

When silver beams on tranquil waves,  
Doth weave a path of dreams and light;  
And stars cascade like gilded graves,  
In soft and soothing, tender night.

There, in the stillness, lovers sigh,  
In Nature's cradle, hearts entwine;  
The world fades back, as time glides by,  
In shadows sweet, two souls align.

O Night! Your cloak, a gentle guide,  
In whispered warmth, let love abide;  
For in your hush, our spirits soar,  
In moonlit magic, forevermore.

- Alphonse de Lamartine
