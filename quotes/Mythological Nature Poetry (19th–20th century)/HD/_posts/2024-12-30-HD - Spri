When the spring
shines once more,
your laughter rises
like the lilacs,
like the white-throated sparrow
rising upon
a deep blue sky.

The daylong
toil flutters off,
a dove’s gentle wing,
for the sun is a mirror
and the air—a sweet
caress of gold.

Now listen close,
for the water's soft song
will touch you,
you in turn
touching the realm
of all that is fresh,
a waking delight
that bids you to dance,
a spring bloom
where perfumes weave.

Tread softly, my love,
for gentleness
eyes into the hearts
of the tender and wild.
