In the morning light, the mountains stand,
Majestic guardians over the vale,
Their silence profound, a sacred space,
Where echoes of ages cradle the air.

Each peak a whisper of eternity,
Kissed by clouds that drift and change,
I feel their strength permeate my bones,
The pulse of earth thrums deep within me,
Awakening the soul to life's rhythm.

Here, where the sky meets the stone,
The world unveils its finest tranquility,
And I am just a speck, a fleeting thought,
In the grandeur of the mountainsâ€™ reign.

- Umberto Saba
