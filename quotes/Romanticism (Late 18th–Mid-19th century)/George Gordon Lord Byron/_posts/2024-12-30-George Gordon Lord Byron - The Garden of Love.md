And wild the wave is, blithe the breeze  
That stirs the amaranthine bowers,  
And whirling wild an airy tease  
To life, with spirit, amid the flowers—  
 
O’er the wild expanse, so sweet and green,  
To taste of living balm,  
The sun comes pouring through the sheen,  
In golden grace, forever calm.  
 
Thus is life, and thus is art,  
As Nature endowed each nook and part;  
Her passion may not die nor fade,  
With every era she’ll still cascade!

- George Gordon Lord Byron
