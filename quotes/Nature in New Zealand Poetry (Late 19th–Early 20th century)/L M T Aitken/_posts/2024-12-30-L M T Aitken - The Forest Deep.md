The forest deep, with secrets sung,
   Holds ancient tales of wood and stone;
With every rustle, whispers young,
   In shadows where the wild things roam.

The ferns unfurl, the canopy shades,
   A world within, untouched, untamed;
In silence, nature's beauty parades,
   The wild, the free, forever claimed.


- L M T Aitken
