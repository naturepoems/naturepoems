FIRE AND FLOWER  
The flames lick the petals,  
A fierce love,  
While the flower stands strong,  
Against the heat of passion.  

But the roots dig deep through soil,  
Searching for water,  
Finding sustenance  
In the whispers of wind.  

Should we fear such fire?  
Or love the warmth,  
That fires our souls,  
And brings rebirth with each bloom?
