Clancy of the Overflow
I had a job in the city,
For the Factory me view was dim;
But I longed for my sweet blue mountains
And the wilds of my native brim.

And in the quiet of the night,
When my thoughts were racing free,
I could see the stars above me
In the clear sky, bright and free.

- AB Paterson Banjo Paterson
