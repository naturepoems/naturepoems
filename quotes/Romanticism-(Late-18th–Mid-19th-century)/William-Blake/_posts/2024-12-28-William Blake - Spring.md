Spring

O Thou who passest thro’ our vallies in
Thy Chariot of the Sun,
                                
Crown’d with the harvest of the golden grain,
                       
To Thee would I lift up my heart,
To the beauty of the earth,

And the glory of the water,
And the mystic sweetness of the woods,

Which speak of thee to my soul.

They sing of thee in the flowers,
And the streams, they whisper thy name,
And the stars, in their dances,
Would give thee glory and fame.

So O lovely and tender–
Hear my prayer, my heart’s desire,  
I offer unto thee my love, my spirit’s fire:

- William Blake
