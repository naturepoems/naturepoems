Lesbos

Here is a place among risen cliffs,
where the strong tulips, 
are rained by the sea,
and caressed by the wind.
Scatter a few petals,
if I could, 
to ride the billow,
see stars and islands,
fringed with light; 
receive the thoughtful humming
and the leaves of fall,
in this quiet, let me dwell.
