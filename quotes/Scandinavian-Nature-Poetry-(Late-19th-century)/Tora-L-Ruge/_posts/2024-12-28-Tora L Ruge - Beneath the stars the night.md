Beneath the stars, the night unfolds,
In silver whispers, dreams are told,
The moonlit path, a tranquil way,
Guides wanderers through the night and day.

Each twinkling light, a wish in flight,
Guiding souls with pure delight,
In natureâ€™s arms, we're never lost,
Bound by beauty, no matter the cost.


- Tora L Ruge
