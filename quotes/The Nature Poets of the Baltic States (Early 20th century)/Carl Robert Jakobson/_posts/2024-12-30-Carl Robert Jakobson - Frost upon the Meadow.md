Frost upon the Meadow  
The dawn breaks mild,  
beneath a veil of white,  
frost like lace  
glistening in light.  
Each breath is a cloud,  
a whispering dream,  
where nature awakens  
in the morningâ€™s stream.  
A stillness envelops  
this pristine land,  
a moment, a memory,  
at winter's command.

- Carl Robert Jakobson
