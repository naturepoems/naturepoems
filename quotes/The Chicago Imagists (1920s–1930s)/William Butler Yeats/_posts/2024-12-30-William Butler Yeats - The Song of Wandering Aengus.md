The Song of Wandering Aengus

I went out to the hazel wood,
Because a fire was in my head,
And I cut and peeled a willow wand,
And hooked a berry to a thread;
And when white moths were on the wing,
And moth-like stars were flickering out,
I dropped my berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout.

When I had laid it on the grass,
And it was caught, I knew not why,
I found there was a fire in me,
And I looked back at my past end,
And the wild path I made to see.

But I learned the pain you called desire,
And the coldness in my fishing net
Gave me no warmth to ease the fire
That roamed with me a shadowed yet.

Lament of cold embraces hold,
I would possess the invisible day,
So caught I was in all dreams dew,  
I never caught the burning way.


- William Butler Yeats
