As I Grew Older
It was a long time ago
I was a young black girl
In a tallwood house.

I was sad but somehow beautiful.
I waited for you to come
With the spring rain.

Now I am an old woman,
Shining in the sun.
I feel the moisture in the air
Like the whispers of flowers.

And now I look out
Across the age of loneliness,
And remember the sweet sound of the rain,
Alive and full of hopeful beginnings.

- Langston Hughes
