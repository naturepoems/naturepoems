The Peacock
Hidden hearts of  
His jeweled feathers  
Glance against the sun,  
Hurrying, with pride,  
To catch a fleeting light.

Begging in a dappled walk,  
He sets aside the scent  
Of the green  
And moves like natureâ€™s flint  
And crystal, caught securely.

His dance  
Is a wish upon his back  
Color eternal, consummate  
In a plumed revival,  
Easier will be its flight.


- Marianne Moore
