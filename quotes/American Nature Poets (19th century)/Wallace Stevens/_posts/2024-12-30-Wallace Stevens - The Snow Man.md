The Snow Man

One must have a mind of winter
   To regard the frost and the boughs
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;
   And have been cold a long time
   To behold the junipers shagged with ice,
   The spruces rough in the distant glitter
   Of the January sun; and not to think
   Of any misery in the sound of the wind,
   That is what you hear at dusk,
   The sound of the wind that is blowing
   Through the shadowed pines.

The mind of winter, we must remember,
   No one would think of not freezing;
   The snow-covered trees and the light,
   We must have loved the trees.

For the mind of winter
   Is to lose the feeling of loss,
   In the coldness that lets everything pass,
   Not to think of anything brightly,
   The sound of the wind is all there is.
