The mountains rise guard, dignified, vast,
Like sentinels whispering tales of the past.
Carved by time, in silence they stand,
Their majesty wrought by nature's own hand.

The clouds traverse like dreams passing through,
An opalescent thread spun in moments anew.
And rivers carve pathways where stillness takes born,
Life flowing as endlessly as the promise of morn.

Nature, the artist with strokes of the wild,
Leaves tenderly cradling the heart of a childâ€”
To wander amid her, a sacred embrace,
In the vibrant arc of her bounteous grace.

- Frank Norris
