O gentle streams, oh seas of hues,
Nature reveals her heart of sighs;
Be still, and in your depths immerse,
Where each quiet moment, love implies.

To bask beneath the thickening trees,
And listen to the whispers told;
Adventure lives in all that breathes,
In every shadow, warm and cold.

- DH Lawrence
