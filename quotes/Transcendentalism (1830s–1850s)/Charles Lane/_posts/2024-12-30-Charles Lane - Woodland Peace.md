In quiet woods, where waters flow,
And ancient trees do grow,
The heart finds peace, the mind is free,
In nature’s harmony.

The rustling leaves, the chirping bird,
The whispering wind, no spoken word,
Can match the solace that it brings,
In these timeless realms, the heart takes wings.

- Charles Lane
