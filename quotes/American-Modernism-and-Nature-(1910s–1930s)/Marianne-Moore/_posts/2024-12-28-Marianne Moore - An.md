An Octopus

The title of my son
which reminds me
of the Iroquois bird
encased

in a gross jar,
red on a black leaf,
heavy with muscle and (or)
avoring in  clarity.

And I take in my
paper, subtle
and wide;
this movement is as many
as  me—
it is again
so beautifully oily;

as the weather of dying and living
is of two, on a leaf.

Not content with just percolation,
I'm accumulated,

retaining on these walls
its own becoming,
delicate and monstrous.

Embrace,
one glide — be stunned,
At least amuse positively my being.

—Marianne Moore
