Nature's Revelations

In every leaf that unfurls with grace,  
In every flower that blushes anew,  
Nature reveals the heart of her face,  
A sacred connection that feels ever true.

Oh, the wind sings a song, both sweet and profound,  
While mountains keep watch, wise and revered;  
In the beauty of wildness, serenity found,  
In nature’s embrace, all my worries disappeared.

So may I remain here, in reverie and awe,  
With each sunbeam that dances along the glen;  
Nature’s revelations inspire us to draw  
Closer to truth that transcends mortal ken.
