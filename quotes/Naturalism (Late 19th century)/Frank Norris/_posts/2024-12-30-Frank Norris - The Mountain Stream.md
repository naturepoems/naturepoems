The Mountain Stream  
Gushing and bubbling, joyful and bright,  
A mountain stream dances in morning light;  
With a laughter unbound, it sweeps down below,  
Through valleys and gorges, where wildflowers grow.
 
It carves out the rocks with a playful might,  
As it whispers to creatures at morning's first light;  
The cool, crisp embrace of its waters so clear,  
Brings life to the banks and holds nature dear.
 
In its spirited rush, man's worries unwind,  
To be lost in its flow is the solace we find;  
For the mountain streamâ€™s song, a hymn to the land,  
Is a melody sung in the heart of the sand.
