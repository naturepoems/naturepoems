Beneath the endless sky, I stand,
a witness to the seasons’ dance,
as nature weaves her stories,
giving way to life’s great chance.

The autumn leaves fall softly,
a shower of gold, red, and brown,
as the world prepares for slumber,
a carpet laid for winter’s gown.

In this rhythm of time’s embrace,
I find solace in the flow,
as change enfolds each moment,
a cycle’s heartbeat, steady and slow.

For in each fading season,
life teaches without a sound,
as I learn the art of letting go,
in this sacred ground.

- Hermann Hesse
