In the black night,
I listen for the owl's voice,
a call that rises like an echo,
docking against old trees,
a murmuring breath
where birds search starlight,
each whisper crafting depth
in a solace of suspensionâ€”
each note urging me to stir,
to awaken from imagining,
to hearten the silence,
and let the night roll on without me.

- Robert Bly
