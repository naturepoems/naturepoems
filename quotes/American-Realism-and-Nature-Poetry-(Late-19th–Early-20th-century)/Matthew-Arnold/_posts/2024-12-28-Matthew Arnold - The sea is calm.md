The sea is calm tonight,
The tide is full, the moon lies fair
Upon the straits; on the French coast the light
Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,
Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.
Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!
Only, from the long line of spray
Where the sea meets the moon-blanched land,
Listen! you hear the grating roar
Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,
At their return, up the high strand,
Begin, and cease, and then again begin,
With tremulous cadence slow, and bring
The eternal note of sadness in.

Sophocles long ago
Heard it on the Aegean, and it brought
Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow
Of human misery; we find also
In the sound a thought, hearing it by this shore,
The foaming lavers of change and death.

The Sea of Faith
Was once, too, at the full, and round earth’s shore
Lay like the folds of a bright belt, which was, it had been,
Almost an ocean of good
Before it seems to have run out of control.

Now I only hear
Its melancholy, long withdrawing roar,
Retreating, to the breath
Of the night-wind, down the vast, and bright

glory of the sea.

By night and day,
No longer than a thought at wounded pride,
When I returned to a violent loss of bliss, 
And it stretched across before my eyes. If I could weep
I think I might no longer care to live,
For no masthead can ease the grief, to lose
The very point of view that takes your breath, beneath this stupor.
Yet it whispers still, upon the stone-cold shores,
And though I may no longer find its peace,
I am still possessed by its unending chase.


Where the sparrows cease to sing,
And the last rays of daylight extinguish their run,
Littered with evening songs of fading light
Tumultuous, yet restless spirits, stretching  by
The fraying edges lull me to sleep;
The empty stillness of the world remains reaching for the gloom.

And while songs flutter like leaves upon earthen floors,
Brought together by time and stained by the rush,
Missed chances weave together and now diminish
Yet echo sweetly in the outturn of the land 
And gather as hush, within the stillness of distance,
Singing soft lullabies of nights end.

- Matthew Arnold
