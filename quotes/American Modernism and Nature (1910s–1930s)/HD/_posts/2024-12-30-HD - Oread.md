Oread

Whirl up, sea—
whirl your pointed pines
    high over my head
    and lunate on the sea
    the point of the sea
         whose source is earth. 

Whirl—whirl—
    the sea’s gestation
    of arboreal shadows,
    knotted and gnarled,
    with upturned roots  
more like feathered fish,
        icily slapping
      the volumes of sea
                     at the base
of those obsidian rocks.

I hail the
    Sea gives birth
       and nurtures
         to every saliferous fern.”
—H.D.
