The Grass so Little has to do—  
A Sphere of Simple Green—  
With Flower bells as Chimes;  
The Buds to decorate around  
For all the World to see—  

To have been going on  
At Last, beneath the Sky—  
To scream between the walls,  
Sitting as if they were  
Once atop the lead!  

This is Poetry, it seems—  
Giving Clarity a way  
As if I were part of this,  
So much—life's left to share  
This way—alone—  

*The Grass so Little has to do*

- Emily Dickinson
