Blueberries

In the woodland sunlight,  
The blueberries are ripe,  
A fat, round fruit is glistening  
And hides beneath the leaves.

I stoop to gather them;  
Thick bushes twist around me  
And water lurks in the cornersâ€”  
This is the heart of summer,  
And the sun has unraveled  
Time into blue.

- Amy Lowell
