A heavy fog lay on the land,  
   And the sky was nothing but a pall;  
The trees were chilled and bare,  
   And the river was a silence,  
   That spoke the tale of winter's call.
   As I wandered without care,  
   It was the beauty of the dark,  
   That sank into my heart,  
   It was nature's own remark. 


- Theodore Dreiser
