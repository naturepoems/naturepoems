The day is full of promise,
Both in the high hills, where—
The pine-clad ridges stand, 
And as the morning lifts
The veil from their brows.
But by the lake, the sounds
Of bird and wave conjoin—
A truer music expressed.
As the heart beats strong beneath
The stormy skies, unequally,
Yet gently echoing, as the quiet trees,
Respire gilded by misty rain.

Ah, but what lovely scenes unfurl,
Filled with reverence and grace,
Where both wild and tame find rest,
Nature's comforting embrace.
