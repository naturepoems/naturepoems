I dream of the sea,  
                      Of big sea's lilies,  
                      That fill the bud  
                      Of the mouth of the fish,  
                             And plant flowers,  
                      And waves that cower  
                      To smooth an inch of sand.  
                       
       Here I smell  
               The sweet of the sun,  
               The great white cry  
               Of gull and pup,  
           And I sit and I see them  
            Mock me in mirth.  
                I sound the deep.  
                 I see, I see!  
               
               Gulls on the night  
                   Tattered with stars,  
                And the dawn  
             With bursting light cut.  
                
               Sometime  
               The sea wind comes,  
                With mist of sea,  
                I am not your fish.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
