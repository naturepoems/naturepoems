A Lament for Nature

O sweet Nature! thus I bemoan,
For you, whose songs are soft and low;
Whose flowers and streams have gently grown,
To teach the soul from pain to know.

I stand beside the tranquil stream,
Where sunlight dances on its flow;
I watch the flowers in their dream,
And feel the peace that you bestow.

Yet in my heart a longing stirs,
For time has wings to swiftly fly;
It carries with it peace and hers,
For in the past, with you, we sigh.

- Thomas Woolner
