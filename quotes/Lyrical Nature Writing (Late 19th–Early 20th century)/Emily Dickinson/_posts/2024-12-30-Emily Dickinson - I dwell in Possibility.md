I dwell in Possibility—  
A fairer House than Prose—  
More numerous of Windows—  
Superior—for Doors—  

Of Chambers as the Cedars—  
Impregnable of Eye—  
And for an everlasting Roof  
The Gambrels of the Sky—  

The Sun is a jealous God—  
And His Sunsets are too bright—  
Each Room as full as Poetry—  
But often dark as night—  


- Emily Dickinson
