Spring

Nothing is so beautiful as spring –
  When all things wake and flourish,
    Each of the sky’s blue-beaded harangues,
      Welcoming life anew, fresh and lush,
  In the unworn beauty of day’s gleam,
    Burst forth after cold night's hush!

    May this vibrant green, this benign full spray,
  Run through the veins, a joy that transfigures;
    Merging into one majestic throng –
  From buds to blooms, the season emboldens,
    Each breath infused with the spirit of song,
    That we may share the wonder of spring’s flares.

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
