In every leaf, the stories dwell,  
inscribed in emerald veins so fine;  
from fragrant blooms, to the evening bell,  
life’s cycle flows, a dance divine.
\nFrom seeds that crack and stretch to light,  
to fruits that ripen in the sun,  
nature’s tale unfolds in sight,  
a journey shared by everyone.

- John Dewey
