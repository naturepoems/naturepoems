End of Summer

Summer draws faint, a whisper of light,  
With copper hues, day yields to night.  
The golden fields bend to a silent song,  
As harvest approaches, the days grow long.  

A chill lingers soft on the edge of the dawn,  
While the weight of the harvest pushes on.  
Leaves turn to ember as time moves on,  
In the twilight's embrace, all beauty is drawn.  

Yet the heart aches gently for summer’s bright flame,  
While the wind speaks low with a whispered name.  
For as shadows fall, and the light fades away,  
So the echo of summer call—and stay.
