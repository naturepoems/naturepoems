author: T S Eliot
quote: "The river flowed, a silver line,
Beneath the arch of the ancient bridge,
Whispers of the wind entwined,
In moments where the world seemed to fray.

A solitary bird took flight,
From the banks, where the reeds grow tall,
A fleeting shadow, pure delight,
In the stretch of an evening's call."

The river flowed, a silver line,
Beneath the arch of the ancient bridge,
Whispers of the wind entwined,
In moments where the world seemed to fray.

A solitary bird took flight,
From the banks, where the reeds grow tall,
A fleeting shadow, pure delight,
In the stretch of an evening's call.

- T S Eliot
