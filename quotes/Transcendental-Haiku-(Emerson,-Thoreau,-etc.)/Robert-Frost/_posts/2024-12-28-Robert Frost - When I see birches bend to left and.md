author: Robert Frost
quote: "When I see birches bend to left and right  
Across the lines of straighter, darker trees,  
I like to think some boy's been swinging them.  
Aw, they are too soft for this,  
But he has to make them bend.  
He does not make them look."

When I see birches bend to left and right  
Across the lines of straighter, darker trees,  
I like to think some boy's been swinging them.  
Aw, they are too soft for this,  
But he has to make them bend.  
He does not make them look.

- Robert Frost
