The Flower

Here is the rise of how
from roots kissed by the dew,
flower fathom day in day.
Hear this rich beauty,
you draw me rising,
see me seed, corolla pearl,
nurtured in ash and time.
Weave me in, bright,
through the plant, the thorn,
for life winds up,
through the rituals in the green breath,
as nature flows, wonders come to me,
carry my colours drawn deep-close,
each inside this bloom!
