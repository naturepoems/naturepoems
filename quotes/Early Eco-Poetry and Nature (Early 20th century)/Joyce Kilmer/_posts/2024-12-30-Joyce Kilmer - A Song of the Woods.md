A Song of the Woods   
In every shade and every glen,  
The pines, the oaks, the glorious men  
Of nature sing in harmony,  
Their rustling leaves a symphony.  
Join with me in a joyous hymn,  
For every tree that grows, every whim  
Of the wind and the stars above  
Is nature's hymn, composed of love.

- Joyce Kilmer
