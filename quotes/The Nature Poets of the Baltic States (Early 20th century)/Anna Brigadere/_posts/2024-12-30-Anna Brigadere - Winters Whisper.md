When snow blankets the earth in a soft, white shroud,
The world becomes quiet, a hush all around.
Stars guide the night with a crystalline crowd,
In this silent wonder, our hearts become bound.

Each flake carries stories from skies high above,
Painting the landscape with a delicate grace.
In this winter embrace, is a tender love,
A time for reflection, a slow, gentle pace.

- Anna Brigadere
