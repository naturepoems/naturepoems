Excelsior

The shades of night were falling fast,  
As through an Alpine village passed  
A youth, who bore ’mid snow and ice  
A banner with the strange device,

Excelsior!  
. . . .  
And through the gloom, and cold, and night,  
That shone so brightly, with hopeful light.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
