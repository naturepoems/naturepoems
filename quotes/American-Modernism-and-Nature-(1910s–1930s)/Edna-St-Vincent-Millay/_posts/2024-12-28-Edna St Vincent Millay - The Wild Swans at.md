The Wild Swans at Coole

The trees are in their autumn beauty,
  The woodland paths are dry,
Under the October twilight the water
  Mirrors a still sky;
Upon the golds and all the greens,
  A shadow of gold to flee,
Transforming the falling leaves
  Into hues all of their own. 
I see the swans live in swimming clear
  And their music is a memory. 
There is grace in the swans’ fading flight
  A beauty that you still can see.
The years have given more to me,
  To enjoy your beating wings.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
