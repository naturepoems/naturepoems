The night is starry and silver blue,
Is it the hour for the hunter or the dance?
Simple shadows stretch and shiver,
As the cooling air soothes heat-scorched grass.
O Moon, when do you hold all light in your palm,
Marking each star with lily white, incendiary balm?
I put my hand in the pool, the water is deep,
Rising secrets from places where night elves creep.
Let me sleep, let me dream beneath your ancient spell
In this bower of hidden light, where all be well!

- Robert Duncan
