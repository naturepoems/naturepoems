The trees are laden with their fruit,
In summer's golden glow;
The air is warm, the grass is soft,
As river breezes blow.
A gentle rustle in the leaves,
A distant song of birds;
In quiet moments, peace perceives,
The beauty without words.

Let’s feast upon this bounty rare,
In nature’s grand embrace;
For every breath, a whispered prayer,
For sweetness in this space.


- George William Russell
