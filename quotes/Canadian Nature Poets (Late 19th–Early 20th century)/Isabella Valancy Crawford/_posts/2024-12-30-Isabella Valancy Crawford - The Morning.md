The Morning

Dewdrops glisten on leaf and flower,
  As the sun peeps out anew;
In the stillness of this waking hour,
  Nature calls with that sweet cue.

The dawn brings hope to the hearts around,
  As the world bursts forth in song;
In the fields, in the woods, it can be found—
  In love for nature, we do belong!

- Isabella Valancy Crawford
