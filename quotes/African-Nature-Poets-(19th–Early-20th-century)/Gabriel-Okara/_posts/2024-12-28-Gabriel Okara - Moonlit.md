Moonlit River
Under the gaze of moonlit dreams,
The river flows with ancient schemes,
Silver sheen on tranquil waves,
Where the night’s soft embrace saves.

Reflections dance on rippling streams,
A canvas woven with the seams
Of starlight, whispers of the deep,
While the world around quietly sleeps.

- Gabriel Okara
