In the clear night,
       the mountain has groaned
       and trembled  
       over the bursting leaves  
       that run with green,
       perish,
       over the splintering roots
       of ancient alders.
       The wind comes still.
       Boldly, in the scent of ash
       I find my freedom.

- Hilda Doolittle
