quote: "The juniper tree, bare and still,  
Under a sky of bruised blue,  
A lone bird calls out,  
Echoes die in the quiet air,  
Nature holds its breath, waiting."

The juniper tree, bare and still,  
Under a sky of bruised blue,  
A lone bird calls out,  
Echoes die in the quiet air,  
Nature holds its breath, waiting.
