Here lies the elements,
tangled in the dust,
a collapse of form,
a merger of essence.
The air breathes life,
melding fire and earth,
a paradox of creation,
while water bears the questions,
a mirror to the soul,
in the chaotic dance
of the elements,
we find the pulse
of the universe.

- Antonin Artaud
