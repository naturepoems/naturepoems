Nature’s choicest treasures all around,
The tranquil fields, and joyous hills,
A poet's heart, in thought profound,
Is tuned to every sound that thrills.

A brooklet dances by my side,
The sunbeam rests upon the floor,
The shadows play and seem to glide,
In gentle waves, from shore to shore.

And when the stars begin to gleam,
And glisten on the forest face,
The soft winds hum a soothing dream,
In nature's pure and thrilling space.


- William Wordsworth
