The Star

O star that shines in the crystal night,
Thou bringest hope, thou bringest light,
In the deep silence of events,
Thy lumens shine through the night’s intents.

With every twinkle, fill the dark,
With love and peace seen from afar;
For in thy beauty, lies a glow
Which nature's heart does sweetly show.


- John Clare
