Beneath the stars, so bright in darkened space,  
A sea of thoughts adrift on waves of dreams;  
Each glimmering light, a touch of Nature’s grace,  
In quietude, one finds what truly seems.  

O universe, imbued with mystery,  
In every star, a wish; in every tear,  
A tapestry of life, a history  
Where Nature calls, and we shall persevere!

- Charlotte Smith
