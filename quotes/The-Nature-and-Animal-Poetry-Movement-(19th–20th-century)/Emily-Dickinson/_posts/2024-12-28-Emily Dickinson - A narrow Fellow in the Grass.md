A narrow Fellow in the Grass —
Occasionally rides —
You may have met Him — did you not
His notice sudden is —

The Grass divides as with a Comb —
A spotted Shaft is seen —
And then it shuts, like a Door —
On the Light — and you’re gone —

But never know the texture of —
The ivory — holds his breath —
When just the slightest — blusher —
Of alarm — glances in —

- Emily Dickinson
