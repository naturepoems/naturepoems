I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,
And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren,
And the cow’s voice, and the weak and the blind, and the timid and the boy
And nature wraps them all, and holds them in her heart, and draws them forth at will.

- Walt Whitman, "Song of Myself" (excerpt)
