Sunrise breaks like a promise,  
peeking over the horizon,  
a canvas ignited with hope,  
a fiery embrace of gold  
melded with the velvet of night.  
Birds awaken,  
their notes rise with the light,  
a symphony of beginnings  
unfolding under the gaze  
of a brand-new day.  
Each ray shines a reminder  
that every closing lamp  
holds the potential of light,  
that dawn follows every dusk,  
a testament to the cycle  
of life reimagined.
