Filling Station

Oh, but it is dirty!  
The lines of the filling station,  
down below the shadowed awning,  
dirt in dark shed,  
on the counter,  
the oil upon candles,  
a few unpeeled apples were wedged in  
it; no need now—but even there  
youth sits too near  
to work enough; now that  
the door is open, the brightness  
sharp at the back.  

One in the store, it seems outdoor;  
the mirror at the door is still darker,
like an evening access—a note!  
Time, shift hands with a bend behind lies.
A deep breath bestows here, it seems, although,  
with lingering spots, that child at the store  
searches for shallow joy.

The grease on the floor shows many grooves—it must grow!
Here, many steps too small, remembered.
Surprised!  A cradle of light;  
a mom, there opening a tap.
After bitter slept shall take it bright.  

So drop those bright shining lilies
 into the tank;  
there must be no reward.
In our hearts  
there must be raised plants for breathing!
