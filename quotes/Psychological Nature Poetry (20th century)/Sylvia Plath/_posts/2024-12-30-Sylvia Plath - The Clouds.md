I see the clouds,
  Piled like fresh hay in the sky,
  Waving good morning to the sun.
  Beneath this flamboyant canopy,
  Bees dance, chirp, and buzz,
  A raucous riot of celebration—
  I follow their sweet trails,
  Through the dewy grass,
  Feeling the hum beneath my palm,
  The sound of earth coming alive.
  Nature’s heart is beating.
  Can you hear it?

- Sylvia Plath
