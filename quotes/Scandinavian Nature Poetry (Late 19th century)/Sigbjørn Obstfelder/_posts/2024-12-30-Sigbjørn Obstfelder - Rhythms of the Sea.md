The ocean, a canvas for the restless waves,
A dance of vast currents, both fierce and calm;
In the depths, secrets lie, ancient and true,
Above, the gulls cry, stitching the world with psalm.

Tides ebb and flow, a heartbeat of time,
Shells whisper stories to those who can hear;
I stand at the shore, breathing in the wild,
The pulse of the earth, forever near.

- Sigbjørn Obstfelder
