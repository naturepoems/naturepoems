Morning Light

The dawn comes sweetly breaking,
   Through the curtains of the morn;
While light the hearts awakening,
   And the world is softly born.

The flowers greet with colors bright,
   The trees sway in the breeze;
The brooklet sings with pure delight,
   And whispers through the trees.

The sun paints golden splendor,
   On the hills that greet the day;
So let me keep this memory,
   Of the light that lights my way.

- Lizette Woodworth Reese
