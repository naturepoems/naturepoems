Sunrise

Oh glorious sun, so bold and bright,
You pierce the veil of endless night,
With rays that spread your warming light,
And banish fear from morning’s sight.

The mountains wake, their crowns aglow,
In every shadow, life will grow,
Your tender touch, a gentle grace,
Unfolding beauty in this place.

I wander forth with every beam,
In nature’s arms, fulfill my dream,
With gratitude, burst forth in song,
In sunrise warmth, where I belong.

- John Muir
