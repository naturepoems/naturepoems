---

The trees are down, the sky is clear;
From transporting winds the air is free.
And I, a poor lost wanderer,
Am crying 'neath the blossoming tree.

My heart is weary, my strength is wan;
And I cannot resist this sorrow
Beyond the hues of the ancient dawn
And the dreams that follow, follow.


- Rupert Brooke
