A Winter's Day
The air is cold, the sky is grey,
The hearth is warm, the fire bright;
And though the world is wrapped away,
Within, there glows a splendid light.
The trees stand stark, their branches bare,
Yet beauty lingers in the frost;
In winter's grasp, tranquility rare,
Unites with warmth, no love is lost.

- Hartley Coleridge
