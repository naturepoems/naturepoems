In woodland folds the twilight lingers,
As willow trees, like candle-light,
Bend low while fragrant breath still clings,
To spin the stars into the night.

For here the softer shades descend,
And grace shall touch each corner meek,
From conifer to nightingale,
With every sound the silence seeks.

And still the waters wisely flow,
As echoes bid the night defy,
A sense of time is full and slow,
With every whisper ‘neath the sky.

Let evening bare her softly grace,
In twilight tunes our hearts delight,
So let each leaf unwind its place,
And weave our dreams upon the night.

- Matthew Arnold
