quote: "Morning Glories  
    The morning glories climb  
    Up the trellis, a blue cascade,  
    Looks like the sky has spilled  
    Its light, in quiet masquerade.  

    Each petal a soft whisper,  
    Each tendril a gentle embrace—  
    In the garden of dawn’s glimmer  
    There's an ethereal grace."

Morning Glories  
    The morning glories climb  
    Up the trellis, a blue cascade,  
    Looks like the sky has spilled  
    Its light, in quiet masquerade.  

    Each petal a soft whisper,  
    Each tendril a gentle embrace—  
    In the garden of dawn’s glimmer  
    There's an ethereal grace.
