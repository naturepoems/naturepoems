By the Shore
I find you by the salt water,
waves weaving patterns,
a dance between land and sea,
sand and foam.

how far will you carry depth,
your fingers tracing maps of love
and loss,
a shell whispers underneath,
a reminder of time spent,
a treasure hidden.

to stand here, with tides carving
newer shores, while horizons press,
a longing to escape could drown us all,
but I am here in resolve
with the roar of bird calls,
restless metal worn over rock,
kissing each tide goodbye.

Anne Waldman
