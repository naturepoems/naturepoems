Nostalgia

Away, away, pale hills do fade,
And clear the domain of grief that wore:
The slumbering curls of sheaves I made
In time’s ambush on the envied shore.

You served me well and suavely spun,
With wind that caught the gibbous stare;
Cling close dear shutters, to the sun,
Till I recline with history there.

But there are no golden arrows,
Nor any kindled path so true,
Just dust, swept in quiet meadows,
And dreams, cloaked in the midnight dew.

- John Crowe Ransom
