In tangled woods where sunlight sips,
And the creek’s laughter gently drips,
Beauty is penned on each flower’s face,
And time unfolds at a languorous pace.

The hawk soars high on wings of grace,
With eyes like embers that pierce through space.
Each rustle of dusk brings a soft, sweet call,
The world settles down as the shadows enthrall.

To lose oneself within nature's heart,
Is to find the essence in each fleeting part.
For the heavens laugh in the glade's soft embrace,
In nature's vast kingdom—the soul finds its place.

- Frank Norris
