Morning Dew

Awake arises the dawn's soft light,
As dewdrops kiss the blades of grass,
Each droplet gleams—a pearl of night,
Whispering tales of time’s sweet pass.

Nature sighs in a tender way,
As sunbeams dance through leaves once more,
In transient moments where dreams sway,
A gentle pulse in the world’s core.

With each new day, life’s song renews,
In myriad forms, in boundless hue,
In morning’s light, the heart imbues,
A promise held in morning dew.
