The River

The river flows with ease and grace,  
Reflecting skies in a liquid embrace;  
Winding through valleys, past rocks and reeds,  
Carving its story while nature feeds.  

In spring, it dances with laughter and song,  
As to the rhythm of life, it flows along;  
Yet when winter comes, with its icy blast,  
The river lies tranquil, memories amassed.  

But every season, it whispers true,  
Of journeys taken, of skies so blue;  
So let us wander beside its shore,  
And hear the tales of its timeless lore.

- E J Brady
