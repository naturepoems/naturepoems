Seeing the Sea

The sea is everywhere,
glistening with salt,
a mirror of heaven.
And your laughter
rolls like tidal waves
upon the beach.

Footsteps linger,
buried in wet sand—
you are here,
yet somewhere else,
adrift in thought.

Listen to the gulls,
they cry your loneliness,
comfort your solitude.

Philip Whalen
