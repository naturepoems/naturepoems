After Apple-Picking  
My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree  
Toward heaven still,  
And there's a barrel that I didn't fill  
Beside it, and an apple picker’s hand.  
  
There’s a little half-moon overhead,  
A scar in the apples of the tree.  
I feel a deep satisfaction,  
The day is almost perfect  
And summertime is almost here.

- Robert Frost
