Storm on the Coast

Great fluffy clouds loom high and proud,  
The winds arise and howl aloud;  
The ocean churns, a mighty force,  
As nature stirs with wild discourse.  

The waves rise high, then crash and break,  
With thunder’s roar, the heavens shake;  
As the storm descends, we brace in awe,  
In nature’s tempest, we see the raw.  

Yet when the storm has had its say,  
And the landscape glistens with fresh display,  
A rainbow arches, a promise bright,  
For after the storm comes the peaceful light.

- E J Brady
