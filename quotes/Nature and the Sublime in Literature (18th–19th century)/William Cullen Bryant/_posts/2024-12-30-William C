To the Mountains

I love your sculptured forms, grand and white,
Your frost-kissed peaks pricking the sky,
Like ancient sentinels, descriptive and bright.
Above the vale spread while time draws nigh,
And taught my heart to yield like Easter’s glow.

To hear the whispers of the peaceful streams,
Flowing down your shoulders, vague and soft;
Carried toward the ocean bright through dreams
Of midday, cries from my heart aloft.  
Peace grows when I reach the hills,
As echoes die in darkened rooms,
Where sorrow builds the turrets as she wills.


- William Cullen Bryant
