The whispering winds on mountain tops,
 The wayward clouds that twist and hop.
 In nature’s breath, we find our flight,
 A tapestry of day and night.

 Each star above, a guiding light,
 Each sunrise brings a new delight,
 In every glance, the world anew,
 In nature dwells both love and truth.


- Roger Fry
