The Pasture

I’m going out to clean the pasture spring;
I’ll only stop to rake the leaves away
(And wait to watch the water clear, I may)
I shan’t be gone long.—You come too.
I’m going out to fetch the little calf
That’s standing by the mother. It’s so young,
It totters when she licks it with her tongue.
I shan’t be gone long.—You come too.

The connector of the field is lined with trees;
I’ll bring a wheelbarrow full of leaves.
(White birches and red oaks and a bush)
I shan’t be gone long.—You come too.

I’m going out to clean the pasture spring;
I’ll only stop to rake the leaves away
(And wait to watch the water clear, I may)
I shan’t be gone long.—You come too.

- William Carlos Williams
