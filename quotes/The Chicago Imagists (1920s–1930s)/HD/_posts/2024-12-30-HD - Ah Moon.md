Ah, Moon

Ah, Moon, forget me now;
darkness lingers in flame,
bound like the rope;
are these lilies the white paths?
Pluck out the silence,
ance the dryness by the dusk
the youth blooms spare.
In a place long left,
here are shadows that shake us,
a hush, a rope hold,
on willow fancy covered,
brightly flaked, all around;
are they the strings,
that keep us) here,
that bind us?
