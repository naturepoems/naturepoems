author: E E Cummings
quote: "in Just spring when the world is mud-luscious
and puddle-wonderful
    the little lamz are leaping
    (i'm glad so many references to nature)
    and the little lamz are leaping

and the little lamz are leaping
    and they jump up
    and they jump down
        all the way to heaven"
