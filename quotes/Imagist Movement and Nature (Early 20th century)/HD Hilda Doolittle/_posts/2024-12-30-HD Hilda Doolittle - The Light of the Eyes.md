The Light of the Eyes

We have our bitter days,
but
        we have our lovely mornings
and evenings,
            and in between
                all the sun,
                    the sun, the sunlight,
            blooms in blue,
in the green of the meadow,
its brush over the leaves
and twinkles,
    laurel leaves, a-thru,
in soft saffron and cloud.

- HD Hilda Doolittle
