When mist enwraps the rising day,  
And drapes the vale in veils of grey,  
The world awakens, hushed and shy,  
While nature breathes a tender sigh.

As dew-kissed petals start to show,  
Each blossom sparks a vibrant glow,  
A palette rich in earth's delight,  
Transforming shadows into light.

- John Everett Millais
