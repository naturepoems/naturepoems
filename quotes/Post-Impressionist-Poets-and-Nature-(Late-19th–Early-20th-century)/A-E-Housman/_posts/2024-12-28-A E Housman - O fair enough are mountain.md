---

O fair enough are mountain slopes,
And fairer still the skies above,
But a man’s heart can’t rest on hopes,
Nor live by either, but by love.

Where the fullness of life was won,
And the sun had a wider way,
There I heard the first sweet breath of fun,
In a world that was glimmering with play.

And every hill and every vale,
In the heart of the green
Form a perfect picture for each tale,
That makes laughter bright and keen.

- A E Housman
