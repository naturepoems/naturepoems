The Forest Sanctuary

In the blue-green shades are sleeping leaves,  
Now dim-stared day springs, takes peace for you;  
In stillness, gentle air darker eaves,  
The hush is temping woods of onyx hue.

Among the seated groves out of the strain  
Gentle what wood‐signs seem, here dost stay to glean,  
While wishful hearts in such faithful chain,  
Their winds meet as doe’s sane can keen.  

Now dark crown-marged days depart as signs,  
And evening's floods disperse the dark;  
O bloom of multi-land, thy strength resigns,  
In silence wan and shut as barriers march.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
