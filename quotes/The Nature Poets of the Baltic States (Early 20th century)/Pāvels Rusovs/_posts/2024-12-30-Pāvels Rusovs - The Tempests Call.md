In the storm’s fierce embrace,
When thunder booms like a heartbeat,
The dance of the winds grows wild,
And rain lashes at the thirsty ground,
A tempest of life ignites the air.

Yet, behind the chaos lies calm,
As nature weeps and rejoices,
Every droplet quenches fire,
And in the aftermath’s embrace,
The world is born anew once more.
