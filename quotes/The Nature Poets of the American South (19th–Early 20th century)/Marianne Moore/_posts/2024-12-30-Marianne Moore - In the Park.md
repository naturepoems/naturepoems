In the Park

  I feast to see the sun as it hovers,
    gathering from the dresden trees,
    linseed has become a libation —
        the conscience quenched, green shades crossed over,
 
  as a heavy silence settles next to the stone and pine,
     and to when a tree cannot be dislodged
        by the fabric taut on its trunk
while the dreaming layers, like a daze;
       every sound here about where nature sings now.
  Furry shadows of innocence recede; forests sing as they surface,
 a lapwing close its pine and drift on, serene sea;  
      and from sleep, comes lust.
        At the far edge of my breath a distant sky —
      endless snows, brimming with treaties outside the native,
are like brief signs upon wings rising still.


- Marianne Moore
