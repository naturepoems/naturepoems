Sitting under this tree
  That was once a child, barren
  Of the life swollen round
  With birds who pierce wood.
  I am roots extending,
  Tangling deep, until a new
  Growth rinsed through, turns
  Wood into more woodâ€”
  A complex tangle,
  For hours, or days,
  Or centuries to discover,
  A wilderness untouched.

- Sylvia Plath
