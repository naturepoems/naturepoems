Whispers of the Wind
In the evening light, whispers roam,
Through the meadow, calling me home.
Gentle breezes, soft and low,
Carry secrets only they know.

Variations of the wildflowers bloom,
Their colors dance, dispelling gloom.
Nature's canvas, vast and grand,
Painted by the creator's hand.


- Oda Ndukkor
