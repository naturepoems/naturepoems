To Autumn

Ode to Autumn
   Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
   Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
   With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,
   And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
   To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
   And still more, later flowers for the bees,
   Until they think warm days will never cease,
   For Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.

Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?
   Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,---
   While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
   And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
   Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
Among the river sallows, borne aloft
   Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
   And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
   Hedge-crickets sing, and now with treble soft
   The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft;
   And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.


- John Keats
