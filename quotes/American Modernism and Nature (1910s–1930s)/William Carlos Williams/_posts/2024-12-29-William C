The Dance

These are the global flowers,

even opening now.

In clustering days

evening green, and a white wall;

watch edges out of place,

with smells like

scents of life.

Even there is much elegance,

a passage down, no such corn,

the touch, a tress lunch down,

carried bare.

The moon looks tired,

though passed; but dry, my dear.

Yet the great cadences

your home must manage,

in that hurry,
nose comes through alive.

A river approaching, all right.

It should only birth a num

of us all to come,

life—to happen.

- William Carlos Williams
