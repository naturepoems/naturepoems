Binsey Poplars

Felled autumn, as time tossed these trees,  
In the end of day they will burn,  
Wait for a blaze in the way it leaves,  
And thus go near—those hollowed locks now wheeze,  
Like banshees howling of fall’s slow yearn.
— but then the fire will cease to rise,  
And thus, in the breath of mild, waft your sigh by now,
And love! do cross that turbid place in bare bows.

— Gerard Manley Hopkins
