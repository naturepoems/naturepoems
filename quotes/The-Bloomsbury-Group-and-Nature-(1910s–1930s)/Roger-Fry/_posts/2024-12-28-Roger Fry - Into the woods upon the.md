Into the woods, upon the heath,
Midst all the life of leaf and breath,
I find in sound, in scent, in sight,
The whispered wisdom of the night.

Beneath the boughs, the light will play,
Striking gold through green decay,
And every shadow, long and deep,
Holds secrets that the stillness keep.


- Roger Fry
