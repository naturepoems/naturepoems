In every shadow, nature glows,
While secrets rest in roots below.
Life festers in the soil’s embrace,
Each heartbeat finds its natural place.
        
From quiet corners, echoes rise,
Through whispers shared beneath the skies.
In tender thoughts, the heart can grow,
The journey stirs, where rivers flow.
        
Let time stand still in every breath,
In beauty's arms, we conquer death.
For in these moments, truth's refined —
In nature's grace, our hearts aligned.

- Philip Larkin
