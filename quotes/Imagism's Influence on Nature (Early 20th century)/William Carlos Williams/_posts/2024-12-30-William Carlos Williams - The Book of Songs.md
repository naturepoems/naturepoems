The Book of Songs
In the light of
shattered moments

We slant
toward the water.

The light waits
inside the heart

still and so still,
ceaseless.

Fingers trembleâ€”
gather the light
by the evening.

Scamper along
along the ruins
where the soft come
and giggles lie
against the sun.

There rises
a book of songs.

- William Carlos Williams
