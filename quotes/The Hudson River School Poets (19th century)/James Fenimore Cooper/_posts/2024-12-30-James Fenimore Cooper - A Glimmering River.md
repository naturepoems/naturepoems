The river a-glimmer,
   Like a serpent of light,
With the soft touch of twilight
   On the edges so bright.

As the waters do wander,
   With an infinite grace,
They speak of the journeys
   In this beautiful place.

Let me linger in stillness,
   With the evening set deep,
For the heart of the river
   Rocks my soul into sleep.

- James Fenimore Cooper
