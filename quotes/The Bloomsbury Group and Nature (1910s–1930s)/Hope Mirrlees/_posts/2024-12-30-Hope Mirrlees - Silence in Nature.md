SILENCE IN NATURE

Oh, let a hush bind the wild lands in sighs,
Where the brook murmurs faintly through wooded returns,
In the heart of the forest, beneath smoothed-out skies,
A quiet tranquility hums where life yearns.

The crickets converse in their soft-spoken tongue,
While the leaves rustle secrets, the cool breezes tease;
In this moment, a lullaby gently is sung,
Where harmony flourishes, and souls find their ease.

Oh, nature's own breath, in repose we can feel,
The whispering chill of a world wrapped in rhyme,
Let the silence surround, let its caresses heal,
In these moments of stillness, we bridge into time.


- Hope Mirrlees
