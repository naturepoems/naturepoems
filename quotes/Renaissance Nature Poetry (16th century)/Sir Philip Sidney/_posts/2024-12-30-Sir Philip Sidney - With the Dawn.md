With the dawn the dew drops do  
On the flowers so fresh with hue.  
O nature, sweet and ever pure,  
Your beauty does my soul allure.  
Each leaf that trembles in the air,  
Whispers love, yet lingers there –  
A tale of hope, a boundless sea,  
The woodland’s call, the heart of me.

Each bird that sings a softer note,  
In quiet woods doth gently float;  
O how sweet are birds in flight,  
Underneath the blessed light!  
With my heart, I tread the glade,  
In every shade my love is made.

- Sir Philip Sidney
