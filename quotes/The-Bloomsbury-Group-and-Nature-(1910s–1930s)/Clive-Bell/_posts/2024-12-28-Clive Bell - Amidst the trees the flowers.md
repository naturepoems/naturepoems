Amidst the trees, the flowers bloom,
In nature's garden, there's no room for gloom.
Sweet scents linger in the air,
A tranquil world beyond compare.

Where sunlight kisses the rippled stream,
Life flows gently, a tender dream.
In the embrace of the great outdoors,
We find the peace that our spirit adores.

- Clive Bell
