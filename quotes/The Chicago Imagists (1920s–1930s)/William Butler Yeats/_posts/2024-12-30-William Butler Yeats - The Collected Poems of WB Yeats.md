The Collected Poems of W.B. Yeats

The following excerpts come from the collected experiences:
Burning above us bare with stone,
  Upon the silver scarred charm,
Though decay with water from justice be,
  We give our labour as darkened hues.

Shutter a plum stained in hesitation stirs,
  And gather thicket leaves above our heads,
One branch alone I behold comically,
  Crushed as amidst an old grey spectral sound.

A bridge consoles so gently spoken,
  Of misted worlds we never see,
Regarding heartless shades that stoop,
  I awoke from sleep as though in mist.


- William Butler Yeats
