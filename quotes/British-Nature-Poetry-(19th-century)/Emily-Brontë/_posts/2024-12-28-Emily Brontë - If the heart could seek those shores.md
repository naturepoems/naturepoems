If the heart could seek those shores,  
Where breezes blow and whisper soft,
I’d take the earth in gentle roars  
And bid my soul to rise aloft.

The rushes bend, the waters flow,  
Each petal opens, grace anew,
With morning’s burst in brilliant glow,  
I find within the dawn’s bright dew.  


- Emily Brontë
