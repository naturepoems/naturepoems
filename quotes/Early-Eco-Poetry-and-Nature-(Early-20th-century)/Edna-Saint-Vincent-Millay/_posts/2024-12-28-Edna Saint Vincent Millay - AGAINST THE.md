AGAINST THE DARK

So dark this night, yet stars do gleam,
Like glimmers of dreams, I find my way.
The hush of dusk is a bedtime theme,
As nature falls into a sway.

The waters murmur softly now,
The moonlight bathes the brook in silver,
The wide expanse holds sacred vow,
And echo of the nightâ€™s soft shiver.


- Edna Saint Vincent Millay
