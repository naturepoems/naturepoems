Beneath the arch of starlit skies,
The midnight lake reflects the dreams,
With every ripple, life replies,
In whispers soft, as twilight gleams.

Each wave a story, waiting still,
To find its voice in morning's light,
Nature's heart, a boundless thrill,
In every sound, pure joy alight.

- Gerhard Gran
