The Market-Place

In the market-place, I stood,
The folk around me cried,
For they offered tongues of wood,
And weeds from the riverside.

It was held, I thought, a worthy ground
To feast on streams of life.
The sun glint-gold blazed round
While laughter filled the strife.

But the wild call sang from neither land,
Nor river nor plain so wide;
It was the heart's open hand,
That led where the winds reside.

- John Masefield
