THE RAIN

Oh, the rain, like a song of a spirit,
Falling soft on the old mossy stone.
Each drop a note, in a symphony to hear it,
A rhythm of nature, tenderly sown.

With fingers that sketch on the canvas of earth,
It breathes into life every bud, every tree,
Watering dreams, giving each project its birth,
A dance with the clouds, setting wild hearts free.

Let it tap on the roofs, let it play on the floor,
A lullaby sweet, where the rivers run wide,
In the rich, soaked embrace, oh, the world we adore,
In the pulse of the rain, where we quietly bide.


- Hope Mirrlees
