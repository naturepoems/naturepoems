Rain

Today the sky is grey,
  The sun has lost its way;
In whispers soft and low
  The gentle rain must sow.

The earth drinks deep and fast,
  And cleanses from the past;
In drops as fine as silk
  The green of life will quilt.

So sleek the bloom of trees,
  So rich the pastures ease;
Let storm or thunder ring,
  From rain shall spring the spring.


- Mary Gilmore
