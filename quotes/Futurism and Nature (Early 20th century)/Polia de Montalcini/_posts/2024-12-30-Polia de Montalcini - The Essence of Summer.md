The Essence of Summer

Sun-soaked hours warp with heat,
mirages dance in the distance,
a lullaby of chirping crickets,
at twilight’s gentle caress.

Lemonade smiles linger,
a sweetness tasted on lips,
the air thick, heavy with release—
a respite from the mundanity.

Bathe in warmth, let the sweat bead,
as twilight ushers in the stars,
an exuberance, palpable,
in the pulse of life’s lazy embrace,
a moment to savor, before dusk overtakes.
