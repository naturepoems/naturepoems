Whispers of the Forest
In the quiet breath of dawn,
The forest whispers soft and low,
Beneath the rustling leaves,
The secrets of the night still flow.

Sunlight filters through the boughs,
Dancing on the dew-kissed ground,
Each shadow tells a story,
In natureâ€™s voice, we are spellbound.

- Aldona Gustava
