quote: "The twilight hour paints the scene,
Characters in shadows mimic trees;
A lullaby of night descends,
As stars awaken, brightening the air.
Nature lingers softly in the embrace,
Until dawn breaks with a tender light."

The twilight hour paints the scene,
Characters in shadows mimic trees;
A lullaby of night descends,
As stars awaken, brightening the air.
Nature lingers softly in the embrace,
Until dawn breaks with a tender light.
