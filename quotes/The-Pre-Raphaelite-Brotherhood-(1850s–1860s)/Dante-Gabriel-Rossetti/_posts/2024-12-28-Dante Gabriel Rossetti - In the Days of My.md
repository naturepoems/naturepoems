In the Days of My Youth

In the days of my youth, my dreams were steeped  
Under roses of dusky air,  
While leaves adorned with dew's fast creep  
In swaying neural aisles grew fair:  
Sweet to my touch, I breathed of flowers,  
Of coolness, parting crowning sun;  
How soft on brow the melting hours  
Were evenings pure as starlit run.

Such time drifts slow as streams are gladdened;  
Here glade and blue will grace my roam,  
For still their breath, my quest has madded  
Along nigh shallops without home.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
