Morning in the Mountains

In the morning light of the mountains,
    When the dew still lingers low,
And the dawn in her golden fountains
    Pours light on the white-capped snow,
Each peak awakens, and bids me go forth,
    As the hint of the day draws near,
To drink in the beauty, and joy the rich worth
    Of the grandeur that beckons here.


- Alfred Domett
