The Ways of White Folks

Their eyes can’t see,
Their hands can’t touch,
They can’t taste the air,
I breathe, my vitality.

But on these streets,
The world is great, vast and wild,
Green limbs stretching,
And the earth pulsates,
Life flows in the veins of all,
Colors bloom,
In the nature held dear,
Let every song resonate within, 
For they will hear.

Let us not forget,
That beauty lies everywhere,
In the shade of a tree.
In the laughter of streams,
In the voice of our souls,
Let us sing alive!

- Langston Hughes
