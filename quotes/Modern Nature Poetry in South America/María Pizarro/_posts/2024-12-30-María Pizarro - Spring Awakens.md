Spring Awakens

In the thaw of winter’s grasp,
the world stirs from silence,
a tender green creeping forward,
a promise wrapped in petals.

Each bud breaks through dark soil,
a song of genesis softly sung,
as bees hum along in harmony,
a choreography of life unfolds.

The sun paints golden dreams,
as warmth creeps through the air,
awaking all that lay in wait,
a festival of colors to behold.


- María Pizarro
