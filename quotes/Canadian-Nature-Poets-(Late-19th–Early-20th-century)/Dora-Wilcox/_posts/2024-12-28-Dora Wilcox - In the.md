In the Meadow
  
  The soft green meadow calls to me,
  With fragrant blooms and buzzing bee;
  Where wildflowers blush in sunlight’s kiss,
  And nature’s peace brings boundless bliss.
  
  A brook meanders, clear and bright,
  It sings a song of pure delight;
  Among the reeds, a heron stands,
  While whispers swirl in gentle bands.
  
  The sun dips low, the shadows grow,
  In this sweet spot, my spirit flows;
  Here, life’s tapestry unfolds anew,
  A canvas rich with every hue.
