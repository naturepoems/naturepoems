The Winter’s Silence  
In the grasp of stark winter, the world holds its breath,  
As the silent white blankets embrace life and death;  
Each tree stands a sentinel, cloaked in the snow,  
As the soft winter whispers of wonder we know.
 
The air turns crisp sweet; the landscape is pure,  
In this tranquil repose, of nature’s allure;  
Where the crunch of each footfall echoingly speaks,  
Of the stillness enfolding, to which the heart seeks.
 
So let us find solace in winter's embrace,  
For within the cold stillness, we find our own place;  
In the quiet, we ponder the beauty of life,  
Through the stillness and silence, we conquer our strife.

- Frank Norris
