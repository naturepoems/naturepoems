Landscape

The mountains of Poughkeepsie are simply
shadows cast by the breath of God, the trees

are mighty and outside of all that,
this the land of the trampled daisy

and the creeping vine that courts the fern.

To spend the day in their presence,
it is to breathe the air perfumed

with existence and stride along talking
to the squirrels and chipmunks to crown

the field's grace--to know such an end of day.


- William Carlos Williams
