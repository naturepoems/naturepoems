The harvest moon hangs low in sky,  
a guardian of the fields below;  
with silver beams, it casts a sigh,  
blessing life where grains do grow.
\nAnd in the quiet of the night,  
we gather â€˜round in warmth and cheer;  
a celebration, hearts alight,  
the bounty shared, year after year.

- John Dewey
