I have no need of the great wilderness,  
where everything is possible,  
where the rivers do not have names,  
I choose the garden,  
with its fragrant flowers and quiet paths,  
the place where I can kneel and touch  
the soil,  
the mosaic of life,  
where the sun shines softly on  
the petals,  
and the bees dance, intoxicated with love.

- Adélia Prado
