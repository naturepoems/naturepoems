The Sea

Oh, the sea is a restless thing,
  A moaning and a thronging
  'Twixt the shadows that it brings
  To the light of morning!

It wears in peace a lovely face,
  The winds are dull and sleeping 
  That idle in the soft embrace,
  While upward the waves are leaping.

And when the stars appear at night,
  They glimmer in the tide,
  And the thoughts that ride upon the light
  Are dreams that do abide.

Ah! would that I like thee might roll,
  In the depths of night and morning,
  Unfettered, free—a careless soul,
  To the whispers of the yearning!

- William Wilfred Campbell
