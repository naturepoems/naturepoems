The ocean’s roar fills my ears,
A symphony of ancient tales,
Each wave kissed by the salt of the earth,
A tumultuous dance that never pales.

Gulls cry out overhead,
Sentinels of the shore, they glide,
While the sun dips beneath the horizon,
Painting the waters in hues of pride.

With each tide, life ebbs and flows,
A reminder of cycles that persist,
In the embrace of the ocean’s depths,
So lies the truth we often resist.

- Umberto Saba
