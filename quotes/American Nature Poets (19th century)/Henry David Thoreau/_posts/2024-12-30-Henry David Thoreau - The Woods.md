Deep in the woods,
Where the wild things lie,
Amidst the wraps of foliage,
Where no whisper of man dare apply,
The brook flows, hair-wet and curled,
Not worried at all for the world.

In the sunlight they dance
Every leaf, pixelated thrill,
And crickets chirp the notes
As light phosphoresces 'till
All nature is alive
In harmony, every being thrives.

- Henry David Thoreau
