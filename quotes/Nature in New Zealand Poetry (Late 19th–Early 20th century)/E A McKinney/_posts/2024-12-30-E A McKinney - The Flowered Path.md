The Flowered Path

Along the garden’s winding ways,
Where flowers bloom in a vibrant blaze,
Petals unfurl, a radiant sight,
In the dance of nature, pure delight.

With fragrant whispers in the air,
Every color shows love and care,
In harmony, they sway and sway,
A testament to the light of the day.

Follow the path where blossoms unfold,
Through grasses lush and stories untold,
For in every bloom, a dream to inspire,
Nature’s own heart, a spark of desire.
