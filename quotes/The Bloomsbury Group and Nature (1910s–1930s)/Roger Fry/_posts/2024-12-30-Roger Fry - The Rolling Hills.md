The rolling hills, the dancing streams,
 Where dusk turns day to woven dreams.
 In every blush of sunset’s glow,
 The magic of the night winds slow.

 With every star that shines above,
 We find the pulse of nature’s love,
 Each moment pure, a treasure sought,
 In land where beauty we have caught.


- Roger Fry
