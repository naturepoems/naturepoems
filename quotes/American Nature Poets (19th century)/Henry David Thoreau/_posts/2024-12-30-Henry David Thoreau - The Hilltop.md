Upon the hilltop,
The view is pure,
Mellow sun-drenched,
As time to endure,
In these moments, still,
It grants me to know
What it means to live,
When all life flows slow.

The clouds float by,
In a dreamy sky,
Here within, my spirit,
Breathes softly—why
Should I hurry on,
When peace fills me thus,
In nature’s embrace,
A feeling of trust?

- Henry David Thoreau
