I Am

I am - yet what I am none cares or knows;  
My friends forsake me like a memory lost;  
I am the self-consumer of my woes;  
They rise and vanish in oblivion’s frost,  
  
I lift my hands and drop my hands in prayer,  
The secret loneliness of silence sighs;  
But the dumb silence, like my sorrow, is  
A more solemn music than a thousand lies.

- John Clare
