Put in the ground, let the rain descend,
The roots will seek and the flowers will grow,
The earth will tremble, and the wind will blend,
For out of darkness, the light will show.
Let every petal sing a song,
For natureâ€™s joy cannot be wrong,  
The voice of the earth calls out to us,
In every breeze that sweeps along.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
