The Dance of the Fireflies
In the twilight’s dreamy embrace,
Fireflies twirl, a ballet divine,
Flickering lights in the velvet sea,
A chorus of stars on a jeweled vine.

They weave between whispers of solace,
Carrying secrets from dusk till dawn,
In this luminous love affair with night,
Nature’s poets dance, forever drawn.
