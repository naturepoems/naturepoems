Upon the hill, the wind does sigh,  
And clouds chase each other by;  
The brook does babble down the stone,  
In whispers soft, when I'm alone.  
Each leaf a song, each flower a tune,  
The language of the sun and moon;  
Here nature speaks to soul and heart,  
In every scent and every part.

- Bessy H Elliott
