The Waterfall

In the valley, below the hill,
   Where the heart of the world seems still,
   The waterfall sings of Eternity—
Personifying the breath of time yet to be.

With a clatter and rush, like a wild, sweet muse,
   It leaps from ledge to ledge, what shall we choose?
   To listen in stillness to proud waters dash
Through rocks and flowers, a sensuous splash.

In the laughter of youth, in the mind's deep hush,
   The waterfalls whisper; the music—such rush.
I stand alone—under the treetop dome,
   My heart and the song find a common home.

- AJM Smith
