Wind

I
This house has been washed,
Outside the door is a highway of wind.
Roots, peeling back, skim through pine;
The wind is a wild weaver, unravelling
My life, gemstones falling from a cliff— 
Dust in the way, grass scattered.
A hinge, left hanging,
Whispers in sleep, taunting me.

II
All flags shroud the road,
All flaps that shadow the curtain
Bloom their kindness from colour-mixed eyes.
Everything leans to get reckoned,
Carves at sky with russet bounds,
Whipping across feathery hills,
And at last crashing into earth.

III
Why the wind’s thrumming here now
Is the soft purr of our past?
All eyes light in the faded tunnel
As some fever dreams loom by.
This house has become a simple tomb
And now wind remakes the sky, cementing
Home with a vanishing breath,
Cacophony and clatter joining hell.

- Ted Hughes
