The sun breaks,
   a golden knife
   through the green veil,
     where wonders grow,
        awakening spirits beneath,

    a tender touch
on the night’s chilling breast;
   Nature speaks,
     in colors unspoken,
through the language of charm,

   the beauty of decay
and the cycle of time.

- Max Ernst
