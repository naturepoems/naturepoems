The Negro Speaks of Rivers
I've known rivers:
Ancient, dusky rivers.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

Aged rivers.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln
went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy
bosom turn all golden in the sunset.

Iâ€™ve known rivers:
Ancient, dusky rivers.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.


- Langston Hughes
