The Nature Within
In the stillness of nature, my spirit takes flight,
With the rustle of leaves, in the soft golden light.
The mountains, the rivers, the skies that embrace,
Remind me of home, of love and of grace.

For within the wild, in the heart of the earth,
I find my own essence, my purpose, my worth.
In the dance of creation, in the songs of the trees,
I discover a world where my soul is at ease.

- Kwame Nkrumah
