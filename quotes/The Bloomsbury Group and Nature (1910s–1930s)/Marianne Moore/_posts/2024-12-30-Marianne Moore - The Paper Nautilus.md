The Paper Nautilus

Beautiful, seemingly happy!
Perhaps no life would be worse than of the paper nautilus,
A something grasping and drinking the ocean's glass
Poised nakedly in its mother's reflect
Even as her fine skin dissolves,
Placing her lessons weighty as the whale,

For she must thrive, striving to mimic—
Mastering sunlight's parts as they flick out
Like pearls lying on the ocean floor.

And when this creature is brought  
Into the limitlessness of swimming yet self losing,
Her dainty bones shall last  
More than the roiling heat
Of obliterating tides beneath.


- Marianne Moore
