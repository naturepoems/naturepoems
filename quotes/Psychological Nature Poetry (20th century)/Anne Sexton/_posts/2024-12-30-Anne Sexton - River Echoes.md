The river flows now with a certain grace,
Its voice calm and inviting —
Holding the stories of all that’s passed.
I bent now into unhurried waters,
Watching reflections murmur soft loudly,
Trees dipped low and hushed their boughs,
While I stood rooted, where whispers became gold.
The world shimmered, alive beneath,
Carrying echoes, scents of decay—
In their warmth, I found life’s treasures,
Floating downstream, ephemeral and true.
Here, amid the tumult and the tide,
The essence of the river unfolded.

- Anne Sexton
