My Garden
This is my garden where the sun
Goes forth the day in light re-run,
With flowers that clasp with gentle hands,
And soft caress of unknown lands.

I watch the bloom, it calls to me,
With rustling leaves in rhythmic key;
The fly and buzz and babble wide,
While nature keeps her gentle side.

And so I plant, with gentle care,
The hopes of all that grace my fare,
That here I weave the heart of spring,
And listen to the worldâ€™s sweet ring.

- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr
