On First Looking into Chapman's Homer
Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,
And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
Round many western islands have I been
Which bards in fealty to Apollo held.

Often have I heard it said that this was old,
But I found out the truth with learning keen;
That in those realms, my heart did truly ‘tend’—
To flow from Heaven into the trees unseen.
Come, my friends, we will drink underneath the sky,
And let nature bless us as we let our spirits fly.

- John Keats
