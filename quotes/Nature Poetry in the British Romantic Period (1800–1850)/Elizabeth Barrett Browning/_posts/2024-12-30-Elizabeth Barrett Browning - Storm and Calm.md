A storm approaches, fierce and wild,
Yet beneath it, hope's soft smile;
In nature’s fury, still we stand,
Upon the earth, united hand in hand.

The lightning flashes, thunder roars,
But in the chaos, beauty soars.
For every drop that falls as rain,
Brings forth the bloom, dispels the pain.

From darkened skies, the sunlight breaks,
And life awakens, softly shakes.
In nature's hands, we find our way,
Through storm and calm, come what may.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
