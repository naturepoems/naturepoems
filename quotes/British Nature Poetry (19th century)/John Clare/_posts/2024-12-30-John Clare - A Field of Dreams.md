In fields where the lark is soaring high,
   I see the heavens dance like flame,
While in sweet whispers of the sky,
   The morning glories ever claim.

The brook runs forth in silver bright,
   Where daisies spread their skirts of white,
I close my eyes to feel it near,
   And natureâ€™s footsteps always cheer.

- John Clare
