Amidst the thickets, nature whispers,
Secrets hidden in every leaf;
The fragrance of earth, the kiss of rain,
Every moment alive with belief.

With open hearts, let us wander,
Through fields of gold and forests green;
In the hush of twilight’s gentle arms,
Life’s mysteries lie unseen.

Come, let’s break the chains of sorrow,
Embrace the beauty, the wild unknown;
For in the symphony of nature,
We find a dream of our own.

- Arthur Rimbaud
