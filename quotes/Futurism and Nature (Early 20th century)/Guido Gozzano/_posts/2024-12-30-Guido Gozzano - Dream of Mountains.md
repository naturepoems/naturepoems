I dream of mountains,
Tall, silent, and eternal,  
Stars shimmering in the still sky  
Bathe in a soft silver glow -  
Each breath a sigh,  
In the glacial peace,  
A world untainted  
By the ceaseless din of men;  
Only the distant echo  
Of nature's gentle hand  
Painting the canvas of time.

- Guido Gozzano
