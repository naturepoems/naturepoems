The Owls

The owls in their silent flight,
  Glide softly on wings of dusk;
In shadows deep, they find their night,
  Among the trees, their watch is husk.

Their hoots resound in the cool moonlight,
  In rhythms of the darkened hour;
These ancient spirits, a wondrous sight,
  They guard the woods with wisdom's power.
