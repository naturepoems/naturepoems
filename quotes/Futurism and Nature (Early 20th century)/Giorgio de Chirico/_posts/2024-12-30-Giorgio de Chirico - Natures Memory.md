In spaces thick with long-forgotten dreams,
The sunlight filters through shattered glass,
Illuminating paths where thoughts collide,
With every flutter from the breath of trees.

Each moment hovers like a painted still,
A brushstroke upon the canvas of time,
The colors blur in the gentle gust, 
Transforming old perceptions into art.

Nature is but a memory recalled,
In the silence after a storm subsides,
Soft petals scattered like youthful dreams,
Adrift in the hands of cosmic winds.

- Giorgio de Chirico
