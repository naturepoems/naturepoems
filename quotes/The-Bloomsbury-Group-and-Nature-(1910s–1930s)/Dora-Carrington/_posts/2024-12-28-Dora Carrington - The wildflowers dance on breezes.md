The wildflower's dance on breezes' breath,
In colors bright, it flirts with death,
Yet thriving strong, it knows no bounds,
In nature’s soundtrack, joy resounds.
Each petal lifts towards the sun,
In petals soft, the world is spun,
With every moment, spirits rise,
Enchanted, lost in Nature's eyes.

Awake, the morning dew brings grace,
As shadows fade, and sun takes place,
I wander through the fields so free,
A fleeting heart—Nature’s decree.
O golden sun, my gentle guide,
With every pulse, I shall abide,
In Nature’s realm, forever roam,
Within her arms, I find my home.

- Dora Carrington
