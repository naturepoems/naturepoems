quote: "The only moving thing
is the wind;
that hummingbird
is not just a bird
but a flash of color

newly living, newly found,
hovering among
flowers at the edge.
The sun wakes there
and hums with joy."

The only moving thing
is the wind;
that hummingbird
is not just a bird
but a flash of color

newly living, newly found,
hovering among
flowers at the edge.
The sun wakes there
and hums with joy.

- William Carlos Williams
