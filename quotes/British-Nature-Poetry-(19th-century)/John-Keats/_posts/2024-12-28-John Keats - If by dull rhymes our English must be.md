If by dull rhymes our English must be chained,
   And, like the van-guard of a conquered fight,
   Let us find things more excellent than printed,
And chase the echo of the deer in flight.
Oh, to hear the song of the lark at dawn,
And breathe the air where wildflowers bloom,
With nature's beauty surrounding our fraternity,
Let our hearts not know the confines of the gloom.
Casting aside the weight of worldly plight,
   A symphony of whispering leaves weâ€™ll write.
Where the stars come alive in silver hues,
And sunlight sifts through the quiet blues.

Let the bees hum their golden keys,
Whispering secrets of the flowers' ease,
In summer's heat, let our spirits soar,
Awake to life, forever wanting more!

- John Keats
