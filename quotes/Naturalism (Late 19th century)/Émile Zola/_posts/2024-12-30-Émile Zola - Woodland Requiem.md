In the heart of the wood, where the wildflowers sway,  
a delicate balance of night and of day.  
The fragrance of earth mixed with sun’s golden rays,  
fills the spirit with life in a fervent ballet.

Birdsong awakens, in sweet lilting tunes,  
where the deer grace the glades, under the sway of the moons.  
Each flicker of light through the leaves overhead,  
paints a portrait of splendor where nature has tread.

- Émile Zola
