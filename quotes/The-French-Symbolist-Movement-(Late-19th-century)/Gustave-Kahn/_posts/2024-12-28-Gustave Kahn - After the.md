After the Rain

The earth sighs in vapors sweet,
As the sun breaks through the clouds,
A sparkling dance of drops,
Laughter concealed beneath shrouds.

The leaves glisten bright with tears,
While the air hums with new life,
In this quiet, reawakened world,
Where nature ends all strife.

- Gustave Kahn
