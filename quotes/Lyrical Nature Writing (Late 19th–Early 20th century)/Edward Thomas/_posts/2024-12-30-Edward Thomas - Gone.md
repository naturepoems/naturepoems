Gone

I saw the lark, on high it soared,
In golden rays, it sang its notes,
But down the fields my heart was floored,
As memories, like waves, it coats.

The gentle wind, the sky of blue,
Cradled my thoughts, both near and far,
Yet in the loss of you, I grew,
A spirit bright as morning star.


- Edward Thomas
