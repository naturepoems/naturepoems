Summer

Oh, sweet is summer with its golden glow,  
A vivid dance of heat and light and shade,  
When fragrant breezes through the meadows blow,  
And all the earth in luscious bloom is laid.

The blooming lilies in the river shine,  
And poppies blaze along the garden row;  
In every field, the rosy clover twines,  
As laughter ripples in the winds that blow.

O Summer, when the days are long and bright,  
With jasmine scents and robins in the trees;  
Thy hours are filled with joy, with pure delight,  
Where life sings sweetly, echoing the seas.

- Archibald Lampman
