Beneath the shade of whispering trees,  
In the silence of the moss;  
Where the promises of nature grow,  
And the sun doesn’t count the cost.  
 
Find your way to the gentle glade,  
Where the wild things dare and run;  
For the heart of nature is ever wild,  
And the dance of life has just begun!

- Rudyard Kipling
