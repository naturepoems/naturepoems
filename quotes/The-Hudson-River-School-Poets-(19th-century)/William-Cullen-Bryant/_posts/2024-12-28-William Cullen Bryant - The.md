The Past

In the beauty of the twilight glow, 
In the murmurs of the evening breeze, 
In the softening hues of the sky, 
Lies the spirit of long-forgotten seas.

In the rhythm that has echoed through the years,
In the whispers of the ancient rocks, 
In the tender sway of the leaves, 
If these should speak, what would they unlock?

They have gazed upon the stars that blink, 
They have flitted with the shadows of night; 
They have danced upon the wings of dawn, 
And borne witness to the sun’s merry light.

With every change of the drifting sea, 
Of seasons lost and of cycles renewed, 
The nature’s silent language calls to me, 
To remember the bond I long thought subdued.

- William Cullen Bryant
