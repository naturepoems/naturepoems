The Little Lady of the Big House

She was nature's child, unfettered and free, dancing among the trees, the winds caressing her laughter; where the blossoms spread their colors wide, she flitted through the world with joy unfurling as endlessly as the summer sky, a radiant spirit wrapped in the richness of the wild, embodying the very essence of earth's beauty.

- Jack London
