A June Day  
The golden sunlight floods the hill,  
And bursts upon the forest's quill;  
The songs of birds with joy abound,  
And dance upon the fragrant ground.  

The brooklet, laughing, ripples by  
In glee, beneath the azure sky,  
And all the day the soft winds sway,  
A gentle breath at close of day.
