The River’s Pulse

A ribbon of silver,
shimmering beneath the cobalt sky,
the river flows,
its heartbeat steady,
a tranquil companion to the march of time.

The banks are witnesses,
watching seasons shift,
leaves spinning down,
a gentle surrender,
a farewell kiss to the water’s embrace.

With every turn, a new story,
an echo of the past,
a current that carries the whispers,
of those who dared to dream,
in the cradle of life’s fluid canvas.

- Polia de Montalcini
