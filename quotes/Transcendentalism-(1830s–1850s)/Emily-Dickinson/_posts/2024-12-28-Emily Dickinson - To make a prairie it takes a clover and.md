To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee,  
One clover, and a bee,  
And re very clever bee.  

The clover blossoms are so white  
The honey is so sweet,  
There is no other flower quite  
So pleasant for its sweetness.  

The bee is very busy,  
It buzzes here and there,  
And flies from flower to flower,  
Till all the flowers are fair.  

To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee,  
One clover, and a bee,  
And re very clever bee.  

—Emily Dickinson
