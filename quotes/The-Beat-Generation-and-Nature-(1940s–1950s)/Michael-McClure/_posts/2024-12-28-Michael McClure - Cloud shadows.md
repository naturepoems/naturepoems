Cloud shadows move
    across the fields,
        and the trees sway
like thoughts in my mind.

Each leaf whispers
        the language of the earth,
and I want to dance
    upon this breath
        of creation.

The sun bursts
    through the branches,
        golden laughter spilling
on the cool green ground.

- Michael McClure
