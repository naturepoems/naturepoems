The Peace of Wild Things
I go among the trees and sit still.
All my thoughts go quiet and I come upon myself.
I return to nature; I breathe her gentle air,
I touch green fingers of moss, cold river stones,
and hear the soft pulse of the world.
For a little while the heavy doors of time
are undone and I fall into a sea of stillness,
churning equally as I breathe
I will return there again,
find my peace within its keeping.

- Mary Oliver
