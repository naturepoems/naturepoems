The Silver Fern

In the cool shade of the forest,  
A silver fern stands tall,  
Its fronds reaching for the light,  
A symbol of our land's thrall.  

Whispers of ancient stories,  
Echo through the trees,  
Of ancestors who walked these paths,  
Guided by the breeze.

Each leaf a living memory,  
Of our past, and our fight,  
Bound to the soil of Aotearoa,  
In the soft, dusky light.

- P E J M Taylor
