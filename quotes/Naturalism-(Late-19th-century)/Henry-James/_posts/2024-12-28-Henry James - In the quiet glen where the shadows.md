In the quiet glen where the shadows lie,
A gentle hush is exchanged with the sky;
With every breath, the earth takes in, 
And whispers to me, where life begins.

The ferns unfurl with a supple touch,
Embracing the soil, it nurtures much;
In the dance of dusk, I find my fate,
In natureâ€™s arms, I meditate.


- Henry James
