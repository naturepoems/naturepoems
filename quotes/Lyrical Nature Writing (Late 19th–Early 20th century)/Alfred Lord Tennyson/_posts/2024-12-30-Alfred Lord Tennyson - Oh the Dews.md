Oh, the dews of heaven reign, 
  Upon our fields at night;
And the wildflowers bloom again,
  Clinched in darkened light.

Ere the dawn, wherein we breathe,
  Flutters softly all around,
And in the gentle whispering sheath,
  Welcome freshness, sound.

From the heavens stars draw nigh,
  And the wind gives sweet reprise,
In this hallowed harmony,
  We behold Nature’s eyes.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
