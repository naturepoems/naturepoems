The trees are so tall and the leaves are so bright
And the sun is so kind in the heaven of light.
The rivers are gleaming; they flow like a dream,
Where wildflowers flutter on each silver beam.

The grass is so soft, and my heart seems to know
The blessing of beauty that comes from below.
It whispers of peace in a voice like a sigh,
While often the gentle winds whisper “good-bye.”

- Joyce Kilmer
