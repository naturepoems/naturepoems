When spring breaks forth,  
Bringing life from the clutches of snow,  
The earth stirs awake,  
Unfurling its quilts of green,  
And blossoms bloom like laughter  
In the warming sun.

The rivers run,  
Freed from winter's grasp,  
Laughing over stones and pebbles,  
Whispering tales of renewal  
To every soul it touches,  
Sparkling with the promise  
Of brighter days ahead.

In the fields, gold hues mingle,  
Grain swaying with every breeze,  
A living tapestry of nature  
Radiating gratitude,  
While the blue sky cradles  
This dance of colors and life,  
Painting our hearts with joy.

- Fritjof Nansen
