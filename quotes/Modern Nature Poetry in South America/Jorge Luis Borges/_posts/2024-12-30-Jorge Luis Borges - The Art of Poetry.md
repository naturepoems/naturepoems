The Art of Poetry

I write, as the spider spins,
Helping the world define
And perhaps in the act of writing,
I breathe.

The words are seeds,
Growing and becoming,
Sprouting ideas,
Surrounding me with their
Delayed truths.

The art of poetry, like nature,
Is a riddle wrapped in
A question meant to go unanswered.

Each poem a leaf in the wind,
Every pen scratch a river,
Sows a turbulent landscape.


- Jorge Luis Borges
