When autumn leaves begin to fall,
And nature dons her russet dress,
In meadows bright, in forests tall,
There lies a sense of graciousness.

The berries blush with ripened glow,
And every breeze carries the scent,
Of harvest's yield, of joy's tableau,
While time flows onward, swift and bent.

Let us take heed of nature's grace,
In every cycle, every change;
For in this life, we find our place,
With love, that never feels so strange.

- Hannah More
