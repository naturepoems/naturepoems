The Morning Dew  
As dawn breaks softly over the waking world,  
The morning dew glistens, like jewels unfurled;  
Each blade of grass, dressed in crystal delight,  
In the arms of the day, shedding shadows of night.
 
With hues of soft pastel, the sky paints anew,  
As the earth yawns and stretches, adorned with its dew;  
The songbirds awaken, their melodies sweet,  
In the chorus of life, where the sunlight doth greet.
 
So cherish the moments that unfold with each morn,  
For the beauty of nature is where dreams are born;  
In the wake of the light, we find ourselves free,  
As the dawn rises softly, a wondrous decree.

- Frank Norris
