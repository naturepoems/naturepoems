Summer Night

                    The moon is bright for all to see,
                    It bathes the hills, oh sweet moonlight,
                    In silence, nature's symphony,
                    I breathe and revel in this sight.
                    
                    The quiet songs of winds do surf,
                    As summer night enfolds the earth;
                    Every leaf and bough takes time,
                    To dance as light begins to climb.
                    
                    The stars look down, as if to hear,
                    Each whisper soft, within my ear;
                    And all my cares ye night must flee,
                    For that which shines, will set me free.

- Ivor Gurney
