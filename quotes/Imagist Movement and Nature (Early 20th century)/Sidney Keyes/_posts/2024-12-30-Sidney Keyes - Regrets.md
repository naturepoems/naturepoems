Regrets

What if, while hunting in the woods,
I discovered only silence trapped,
Between the air and bone? If shafts
Of verdurous sunlight slipped through branches, love,
Would I not forget the world bursting into bloom?
What, under the imagine wooden roof,
Did I ever give back, but a whisper, a breath
Sweeping pastâ€”like the flitting feathers,
Rough and dull against sweet wildness,
A sound with shadow, soft with love,
Offering warmth, as it gathers the night?
