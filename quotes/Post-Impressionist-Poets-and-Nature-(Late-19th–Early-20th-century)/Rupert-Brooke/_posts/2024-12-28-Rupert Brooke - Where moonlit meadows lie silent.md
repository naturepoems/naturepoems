---

Where moonlit meadows lie silent sleep,
And shadows weave their dark, soft veil,
The secrets of the ground we keep,
In whispered tales the nightingale.

Among the woods, where wildflowers bloom,
Under the gaze of the patient stars,
The heart takes flight in nature’s room,
And time’s little moments, left in scars.


- Rupert Brooke
