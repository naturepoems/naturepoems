Rain
The rain is falling, softly now,  
       Tapping gently on the ground;  
Each drop a lovely gift, I vow,  
       Such tranquil sounds all around.

The flowers lift their weary heads,  
       As if they feel the whispered tune;  
The world is cloaked in glistening threads,  
       A shining dance beneath the moon.

And in the brook, the drops collide,  
       Creating ripples here and there;  
A serenade from nature's side,  
       Silence but rich as golden air.




- Robert Louis Stevenson
