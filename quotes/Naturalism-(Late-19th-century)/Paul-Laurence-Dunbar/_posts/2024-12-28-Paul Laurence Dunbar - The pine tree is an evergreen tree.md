The pine tree is an evergreen tree,  
It stands upon the mountain peak,  
With its boughs stretched forth in the air,  
And its roots lost in the depths of the earth.

It hears the winds a-blowing,  
It sees the clouds a-floating by,  
It feels the sun a-shining,  
And it sings its song to the sky.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
