Embers of the Twilight

As the sun dips below,
The world holds its breath,
In the amber glow of twilight,
Life pauses, not met with death.

Every shadow stretches long,
With colors rich and deep,
The earth cloaked in softness,
As the stars begin to peep.

Hold tight to this moment,
For it whispers of the night,
In the embered glow of twilight,
Everything feels right.

- Ossie Mthembu
