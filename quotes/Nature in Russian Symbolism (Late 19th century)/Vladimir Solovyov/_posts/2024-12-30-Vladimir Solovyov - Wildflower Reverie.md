The wildflowers in the meadow sway,
In vibrant colors, bright and gay;
They echo laughter with each breeze,
In natureâ€™s play, pure joy it frees.

A tapestry of life unfurled,
With shades of beauty, wild and curled;
In every bloom, a story grows,
In nature's hands, the love bestows.

- Vladimir Solovyov
