The brook's voice flows on forever,
Its waters clear and bright,
More lovely than a maiden's laughter,
More precious than the sunlight.
O brook, swift and unweary,
Clear of the mud and mire,
You sing of the woods green weeds,
You dance in the sun's desire.
- From "A New Year’s Eve"

- Algernon Charles Swinburne
