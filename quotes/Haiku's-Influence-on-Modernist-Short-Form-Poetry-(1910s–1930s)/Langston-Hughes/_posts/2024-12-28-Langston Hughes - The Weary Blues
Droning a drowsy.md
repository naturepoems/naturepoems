Droning a drowsy"

author: Langston Hughes
quote: "The Weary Blues
Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
I heard a Negro play.

With his ebony face
And his hand on the keys:
He made that piano moan
With the melody of the trees."

The Weary Blues
Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
I heard a Negro play.

With his ebony face
And his hand on the keys:
He made that piano moan
With the melody of the trees.

- Langston Hughes
