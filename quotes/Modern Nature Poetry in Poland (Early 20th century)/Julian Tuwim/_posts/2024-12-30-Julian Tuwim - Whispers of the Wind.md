The wind whispers through the leaves,
Telling tales of days gone by,
Each rustle a memory’s echo,
A bond that cannot die.

The sun dips low, the sky ablaze,
With colors of passion, fire,
As day sighs into evening,
Nature’s beauty never tires.

In the arms of velvet night,
Dreams unfurl, take flight and soar,
Carried by the breath of nature,
Forever cherished, evermore.

- Julian Tuwim
