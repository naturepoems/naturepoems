The Night Sky

In the slow quiet of dusk,
  we watch the stars form;
yet feel the warmth from earth's ground,
  beneath the moon,
and for a moment,
  we drift into dreaming,
held in the air of what surrounds.
Time stretches long,
  as if waiting for the dawn;
  back into stillness,
  back into breath—
waiting for the stars
to fade into memory.


- Robert Creeley
