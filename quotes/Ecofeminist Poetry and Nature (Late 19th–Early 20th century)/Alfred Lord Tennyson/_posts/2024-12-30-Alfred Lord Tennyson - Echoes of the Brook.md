The brook was murmuring in the glen,
'Twixt banks that brushed the wending wane,
And as it laughed to the listening men,
The echoes danced in the starry rain.
And in the lilac we saw the dawn
That breathed of peace in a scented hour,
In the thicket, where the violets yawn,
The wild rose blossomed in sudden power.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
