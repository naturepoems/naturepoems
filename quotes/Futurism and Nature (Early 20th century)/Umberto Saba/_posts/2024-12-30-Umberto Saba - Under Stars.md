Beneath the vast canopy of stars,
The night breathes mysteries untold,
Cicadas sing their nighttime hymn,
As the moon weaves silver through the bold.

Each constellation whispers of stories,
Of heroes and lovers lost in time,
In their glow, we search for answers,
Finding solace in the celestial rhyme.

To wander under such a sky,
Is to understand lifeâ€™s fleeting grace,
And in the quiet of the universe,
We come to know our sacred place.

- Umberto Saba
