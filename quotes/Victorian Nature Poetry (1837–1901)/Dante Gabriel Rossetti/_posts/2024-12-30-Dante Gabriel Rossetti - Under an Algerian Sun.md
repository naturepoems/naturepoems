Under an Algerian Sun
In the lofty heights of sky,  
I see the desert stretch afar;  
Where life in stillness holds a sigh,  
And suns beat down, no shadowed char.

O wild heart that cannot cease,  
To long for cool and dreamy grass;  
Yet even here, your whispers tease—  
In golden sands, the blossoms pass.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
