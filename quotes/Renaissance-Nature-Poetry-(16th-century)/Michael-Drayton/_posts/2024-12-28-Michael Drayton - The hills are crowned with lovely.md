The hills are crowned with lovely flowers,  
The vales are filled with sweet perfumes;  
The brook sings soft beneath the bowers  
As daylight breaks, while evening glooms;  

And every blade of grass and leaf  
Appears as if they joy'd to be,  
Their colors fill my soul with grief  
Admitting such brief ecstasy.

- Michael Drayton
