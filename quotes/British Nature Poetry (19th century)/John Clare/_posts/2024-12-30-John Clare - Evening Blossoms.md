The fields are sweet in every hue,
   The garden blooms all rare and bright,
I roam amid the evening dew,
   And every shade gives pure delight.

The roses all of pearl and gold,
   And wildflowers laugh in joyous plea,
While birds sing sweet in tones untold
   To greet the summerâ€™s jubilee.

- John Clare
