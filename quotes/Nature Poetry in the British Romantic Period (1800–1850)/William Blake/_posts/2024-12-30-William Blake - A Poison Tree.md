A Poison Tree  

I was angry with my friend:  
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.  
I was angry with my foe:  
I told it not, my wrath did grow.  

And I watered it in fears,  
Night and morning with my tears:  
And I sunned it with my smiles,  
And with soft deceitful wiles.  

And it grew both day and night,  
Till it bore an apple bright;  
And my foe beheld it shine,  
And he knew that it was mine.  

Into my garden stole  
When the night had veiled the pole:  
In the morning glad I see  
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.

- William Blake
