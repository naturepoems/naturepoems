Sensation

Through the open window of my room,
The aroma of the night rises under the sky!
The trees remember waterfalls under full moon,  
The silver kisses, its sweet song leading me to the wood!  
The vision of green twines swooped the moor,
And heavens hold thought near, the bells, the cries!

I want to spark the light in my restless heart,
To feel the wild and delicate streams.
The fragrant woods reach into my senses
Lifting me to listening arms of the night!

The moment bursts with shadow and fervor,
Delivery of tenebrous pink blossoms;  
From the bow, they lift and cast toward my soul,
That carry all to chase nighttime's meaning!
And Iâ€”this sweet breeze, the healing muse of darkness,
With the stars shining bright on my hand!


- Arthur Rimbaud
