The Mountain

The mountain seems clear with grace  
  Today in the yellows  
  of soft clustered pine;  
 
 my feet  
  stamp rhythm to the earth,  
  a light stride for the melody —  
 
The boughs lay low, as each tree  
  dances with its flavor  
  turning round the shade;  
 
Wildsimian whispers  
  gathering high in the winds  
  become  
 
The wandering thoughts  
  with cinnamon spears  
  to the creeks and shadows,  
 
Life weaves in the high air  
  holding the light,  
  my heart sings in  
 
each spark behind  
  the mountain’s golden door.
