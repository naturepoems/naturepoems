The Eve of St. Agnes

St. Agnes' Eveâ€”Ah, bitter chill it was!
   The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold;
   The hare limp'd trembling through the frozen grass,
   And silent was the flock in woolly fold:
   Numb were the beadsman's fingers, while he told
His rosary, and while his frosty breath,
   Like pious incense from a censer old,
   Hied to the chapel's mirrored flambeaux, and blazed.

There could be no moan, even though the turbulent wind's sigh;
There could be no sound, the stately chimney's roar,
   So that with infinite voices here to know
The same tempest, that stirred the pearl-edged lands,
Hushed on the little mountain,
   or the hush'd waveless lake.

To the moon swings a rosary fixed high,
   The ancient willow-staff and the iron door.
Come fairies then, and watch till the morning sighs,
   But sustain the tear, honor the venerable day.


- John Keats
