Through golden fields, the harvest winds sway,
Each stalk a story, each grain a dream,
The sun drips its warmth at the close of the day,
In the vastness of nature's thoughtful seam.

Crows take to flight, silhouetted in dusk,
The horizon blushing with a peachy tint,
In this tapestry woven with joy and with husk,
The land hums a lullaby, calm and succinct.

- Andrejs Panteļeevs
