The Rain

The rain that falls on thirsty earth,
A symphony of life, it brings;
With every drop, a joyful birth,
As nature wakes and gently sings.

In puddles formed, reflections play,
Of clouds that drift, and sun that glows;
In rhythm soft, it sweeps away,
The burdens held, as nature knows.

- Clara Barton
