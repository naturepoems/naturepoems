A river trickles gently downstream,
As knowing as a loving gaze,
And the silver light of the moonbeam,
Dances on waters in a silver haze.

Here is peace where the shadows play,
And branches cradle the distance wide,
I breathe the essence of a soft decay,
The autumn gold where the life abides.

- Francis Jammes
