To a Snail

A selected meditation  
Among carapaces and limited sections  
Of vacant silence—yet singularly,
Mirrored rim-words in place.

Formation bends each message;
Conceiving the glowing hosts of internal sound  
Fluidly, a point strains  
In many hues—self into colors dismantled.

As the tide comes,—swelling and sweeping;
Repeated sprawling prints uncoil  
To sound the message meant for keeping
Where under heat the humid shadows are away.


- Marianne Moore
