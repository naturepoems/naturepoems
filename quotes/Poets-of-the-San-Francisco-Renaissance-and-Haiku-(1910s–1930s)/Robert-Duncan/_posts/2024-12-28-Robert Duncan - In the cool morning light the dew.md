quote: "In the cool morning light, the dew glistens,
A sprinkle of diamonds upon emerald blades,
As the sun awakens the slumbering earth,
Birds call out in joyous celebration.
The world dissolves in color and song,
Every moment a brushstroke on the canvas of time."

In the cool morning light, the dew glistens,
A sprinkle of diamonds upon emerald blades,
As the sun awakens the slumbering earth,
Birds call out in joyous celebration.
The world dissolves in color and song,
Every moment a brushstroke on the canvas of time.
