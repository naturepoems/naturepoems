Beauty of the Dawn
As night relinquishes its hold,
The dawn awakens, pure and bold.
Colors burst in sentient hue,
A masterpiece kissed by dew.

Birds take flight, their wings outspread,
In silent tribute to what’s ahead.
This daily miracle, a fresh start,
Breathes life into this wandering heart.


- Oda Ndukkor
