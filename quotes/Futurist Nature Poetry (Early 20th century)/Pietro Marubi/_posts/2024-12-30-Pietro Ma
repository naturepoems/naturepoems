The sky erupts in brilliant shades,  
As twilight beckons dreams anew;  
In every variation fades,  
A glimpse of night whispers the view.  

Stars pierce the darkness, bright array,  
Guiding souls through the vast unknown;  
In nature's arms, weâ€™ll find our way,  
To worlds not lost, but brightly shone.  


- Pietro Marubi
