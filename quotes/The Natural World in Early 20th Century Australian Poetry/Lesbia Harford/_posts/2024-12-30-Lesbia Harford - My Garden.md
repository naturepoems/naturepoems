My Garden

In the green darkness of a summer night,
A great wind stirs the bushes,
Stirring their shadows,
The big stars are beginning to shine,
And sound here is a powerful thing,
With whispered answers to the calls of the night.
- 
Here is my garden, crops of the forest, 
Blossoms of the wildâ€”these things I know,  
Even as I grow, I grow, away; 
Yet, I cannot stay, but leave my garden to them, through the night.

- Lesbia Harford
