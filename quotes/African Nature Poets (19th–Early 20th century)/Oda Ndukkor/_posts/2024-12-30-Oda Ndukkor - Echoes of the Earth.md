Echoes of the Earth
In the mountains, a quiet echo,
Tales of wisdom, both high and low.
With every stone, a story waits,
Of ages past and ancient fates.

Listen closely, the earth will speak,
In gentle murmurs, both loud and meek.
In nature's embrace, we find the truth,
An everlasting bond with our youth.


- Oda Ndukkor
