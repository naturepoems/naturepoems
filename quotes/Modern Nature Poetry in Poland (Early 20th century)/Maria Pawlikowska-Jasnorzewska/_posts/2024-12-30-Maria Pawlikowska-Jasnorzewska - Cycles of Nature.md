Seasons turn like the pages of a book,
each bringing its own story,
each leaf a character in the tale.
The dance of autumn leaves,
a farewell to the summer sun,
rustles underfoot like laughter.

Winter will come with its quiet grace,
blanketing the earth in pure white,
a momentary stillness before spring's return,
a cycle of life,
ever repeating,
yet always new.

Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
