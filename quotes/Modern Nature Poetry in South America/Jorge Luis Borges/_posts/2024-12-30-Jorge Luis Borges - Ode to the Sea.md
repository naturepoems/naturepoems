Ode to the Sea

The sea stretches,
A shimmering tapestry
Of fugitive colors,
Infinite in reflection.

Each wave is a laughter,
A voice of the universe,
Saying everything
And yet nothing at all.

Fishes swim like thoughts
In the vastness,
Each fin's flicker
A fleeting idea.

To stand by the sea
Is to touch eternity,
As time melds with sand
And slips through our fingers.


- Jorge Luis Borges
