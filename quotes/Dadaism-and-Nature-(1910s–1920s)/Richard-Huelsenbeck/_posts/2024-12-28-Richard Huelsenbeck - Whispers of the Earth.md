Whispers of the Earth  
The river flows  
with unhurried grace,  
each ripple a secret,  
each wave  
a playful glance—  
a dialogue with stones,  
a conversation with the wind.

Listen! The leaves  
fall, some gently,  
some to the ground  
eagerly,  
a dance of decay,  
a celebration of roots,  
every fragment a story,  
a fleeting embrace.

With every step,  
a symphony of life  
echoes in my ears,  
a resonance of all being,  
a truth beyond  
the here and now.

- Richard Huelsenbeck
