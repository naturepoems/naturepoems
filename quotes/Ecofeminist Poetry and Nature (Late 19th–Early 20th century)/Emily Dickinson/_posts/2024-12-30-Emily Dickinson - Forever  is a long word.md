“Forever – is a long word”  
He said aloud – on high –  
He made the seeming Ever – in –  
Therefore I could die –  

He touched the Heaven –  
With a wave of his hand –  
Was this a world –  
Lying across the land?  

Yet dropped the Earth –  
Alas! the wall –  
An April morning’s song –  
And perhaps no great Fall!  

And yet far below –  
In aheartful summer dark –  
Uncrown the Delight –  
On of The Loving?  


- Emily Dickinson
