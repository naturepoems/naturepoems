The Secret Garden

In corners where the wildflowers bloom,  
Beyond the fence where shadows loom,  
A secret place, where thoughts can roam,  
Amongst the petals, find a home.
  
Butterflies dance on scented air,  
Every moment, free from care.  
Nature’s beauty, pure and rare,  
In gardens kept with tender care.


- Halfred Lee
