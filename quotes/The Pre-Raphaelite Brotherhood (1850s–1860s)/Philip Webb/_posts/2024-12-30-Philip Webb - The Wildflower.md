The Wildflower

Amidst the grove where wildflowers bloom,
In colors bright, dispelling gloom;
Each petal speaks of life’s embrace,
In nature’s hand, a sacred place.

The bees are drawn, the butterflies play,
In fragrant light of joyful day;
Their dances weave a soft refrain,
In every hue, life is regained.

Let wildflowers grace the soul’s terrain,
Where beauty reigns and hearts are plain;
For in their whispers, we can see,
The essence of what life can be.


- Philip Webb
