When twilight falls and daffodils close,
In clusters of moss the shadows enfold;
With soft sighs of innocence, a pure repose,  
Lost in the beauty of night, we behold. 
The willow bows low with whispers of grace,
As velvet curtains of dusk unfold wide,
With soft laughter drifting from each hidden space;
To the heart of the world where our dreams shall abide. 
Each dawn heralds nature's grandest delight—
In whispers and shadows, ‘tis love that takes flight!

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
