The mountains rise, a regal crown,
To touch the very skies they frown.
With glaciers cool and valleys wide,
In nature’s arms, the soul can hide.

Each peak that pierces clouds above,
Is testament to strength and love,
And in their shadows, peace shall reign,
Where whispers of the wild remain.


- Roger Fry
