The Garden of Bliss


  On the blooms there lies a glow,  
  And the twilight creeps in slow;  
  How thrilling by night are the diamonds young  
  That I see in their green, as we talk.  
  Up through heaven’s intense ether  
  They go as the dusk lays the floor —  
  Up through the words of their flowers,  
  As gone from my heart evermore, 
  Till the stealing winds of the air  
  Care swift with the bough on their sheer, 
  While I boardward aim waves so fair  
  To receive all the bliss of the year!
