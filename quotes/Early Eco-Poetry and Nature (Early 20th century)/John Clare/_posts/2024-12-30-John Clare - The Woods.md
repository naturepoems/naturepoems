The Woods
In the woods, the shadows weight  
The very ground you tread,  
Where whispers tell of ancient fate  
In every leaf that's shed.
 
There in the rustling damp and chill  
The echo carries vague and slow  
Through boughs that bend upon the hill  
And secrets only great trees know.

- John Clare
