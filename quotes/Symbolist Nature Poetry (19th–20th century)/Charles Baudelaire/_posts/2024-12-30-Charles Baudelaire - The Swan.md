The Swan

In the weeping willow's shadows,
Lies a golden afternoon, still,
Cedar trees could take to the skies,
Roots tangling softly across still, calm.

As the swan glides, the reeds stand out,
I sink in this hypnotic chalky mist,
I see through eyes of sorrow,
Joy slowly turning into death's kiss.

Sudden and bright, the sun descends,
Watch its colors change - crimson to pearl,
How I pity the swan that swims on,
To the silent burden of this world’s swirl.

Each feather a sorrow, each beat of wing,
A wish for a different life, they want to sing,
And the lake murmurs in dulcet refrain,
With nature our burden, our joy, our pain.

- Charles Baudelaire
