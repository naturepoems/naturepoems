In the glade of whispering firs,
Where the shadows dance and merge,
I find a sense of ancient comfort,
A stillness that beckons me to purg.

The tender rustle of the leaves,
Softens the weight of the world outside,
And in this sanctuary of green,
I let my lonely thoughts subside.


- Anna Akhmatova
