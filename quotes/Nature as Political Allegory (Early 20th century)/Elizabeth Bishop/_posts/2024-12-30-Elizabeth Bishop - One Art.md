One Art

The art of losing isn’t hard to master;  
so many things seem filled with the intent  
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.  

Lose something every day.  
Accept the fluster  
of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.  
The art of losing isn’t hard to master.  

Then practice losing farther, losing faster:  
places, and names, and where it was you meant  
to travel. None of these will bring disaster.  

I lost my mother’s watch.  
And look! my last, or next-to-last, of three loved houses went.  
The art of losing isn’t hard to master.  

I lost two cities, lovely ones.  
And, vases with a thousand flowers.  
I lost the continent of my cool,  
all the remnants of my life before  
a mere accident—disaster.  

Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture  
I love), I shan’t have lied.  
It’s evident  
that I’m not my own, not yours, not this own.  

The art of losing isn’t hard to master.  
Although it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.
