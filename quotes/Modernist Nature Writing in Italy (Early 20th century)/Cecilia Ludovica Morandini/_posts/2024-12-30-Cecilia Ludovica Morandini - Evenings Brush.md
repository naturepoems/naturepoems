Evening's Brush

As daylight bows to dusk,
the sky dons a robe of purple,
blushing softly as the sun departs,
a painter's dream, a fleeting moment.
Stars twinkle like scattered wishes,
a tapestry of infinity,
while the horizon swallows the day,
a silent farewell draped in twilight.

In those quiet seconds,
the earth exhales a sigh,
a peacefulness settles,
escape from the day's chaos,
as shadows stretch and intertwine,
a gentle reminder of natureâ€™s lull.

- Cecilia Ludovica Morandini
