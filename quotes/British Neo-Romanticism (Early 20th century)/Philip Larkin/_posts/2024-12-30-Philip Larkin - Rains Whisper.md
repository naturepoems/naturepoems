Oh, the gentle sound of rain,  
Comes softly tapping on the leaves.  
Each drop a note from natureâ€™s pain,  
And hushes all that never believes.

Let flowers drink the silken dew,  
And let the earth cleanse what it must.  
In every moment, life begins anew,  
In rhythms pure, in timeless trust.

Thus hand in hand, we tread the seams,  
Of nature's lullaby at dawn.  
In sweetness woven, where each breath gleams,  
A fate's embrace, a love reborn.


- Philip Larkin
