quote: "What is more beautiful than a spring day warm,
Where buds unfold and greet the sun’s soft caress?
Each bird a note in nature's quiet song,
A celebration of life's simple return,
In the joyous embrace of the world anew."

What is more beautiful than a spring day warm,
Where buds unfold and greet the sun’s soft caress?
Each bird a note in nature's quiet song,
A celebration of life's simple return,
In the joyous embrace of the world anew.

- Wallace Stevens
