Nature sweeps amid the Hall –  
And finds her Leaves too fair –  
In every other Flower there  
That never treads in care –  

For, in the midst of Happy green,  
A yielding heart can give  
The great delight that feathers round  
And seals its way to Live –  

So let the heart be always light –  
And see those petals wound –  
A softness glows from nigh –  
Till bloom is round, without a Sound –  

And, should the Night creep on to hide  
A Fraction of our Dream –  
To wreathe them all as if to save  
The Egg had found its gleam –  

And if its hallowed Secrets fade,  
From somewhere missed away –  
Then, let thy heart remain a sky  
Till morn shall breathe – decay.

- Emily Dickinson
