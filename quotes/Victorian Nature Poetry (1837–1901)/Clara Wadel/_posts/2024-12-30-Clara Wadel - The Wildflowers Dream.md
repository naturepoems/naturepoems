The Wildflower's Dream

In meadows soft, the wildflowers sway,
In radiant colors, joyfully twine,
They capture splendor in each day,
A testament to wild design.

Though roots run deep in earth's embrace,
Their blooms break free, untamed and true,
Each petal sings with lively grace,
In gentle whispers, life renews.

So dance among the blades of grass,
Embrace the winds, let worries cease,
For wildflowers bloom, and dreams surpass,
In nature's play, we find our peace.

- Clara Wadel
