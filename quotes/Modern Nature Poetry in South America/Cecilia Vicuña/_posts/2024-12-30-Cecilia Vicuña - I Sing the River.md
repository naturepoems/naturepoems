I sing the river,
the winding rivers
that fill the valleys,
where the sun sleeps,
a lap of moisture
where the earth
unfolds its treasures.

Spices of the air,
fingers of smoke,
we breathe the limpid
light of this water,
this sinuous flow,
this life that it carries,
this voice that it sings.

Dance with me,
dance without shoes,
step on the rainbow's spiral
as it leaps from leaf to leaf
from trunk to branch

- Cecilia Vicuña
