The Sound of Trees
I wonder about the trees.
Why do we reject them?
I don’t know what they want,
Or what they mean when they breathe,
When they stretch out their limbs.
In their swaying there's something sweet,
Something comforting that soothes the senses.

I've heard them whisper their secrets,
Calling to silence old as creeping clouds.
They stand shifting, aware in the night,
Knowing more wisdom than we ourselves,
Secretly saying to them that we’ve lost
In seeking to understand the world alone,
Out of twilight twilight their murmurs available,

Why do we move about them, restless
Bubble wrapped in the wind, admiring,
Finding fault in their steadfastness,
When all they want is to stretch and breathe,
To reach to places where no man goes,
And be something more than just the shadows?

- Robert Frost
