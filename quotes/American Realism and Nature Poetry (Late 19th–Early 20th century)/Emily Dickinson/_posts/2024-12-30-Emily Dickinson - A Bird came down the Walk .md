A Bird, came down the Walk –  
He did not know I saw –  
He bit an Angleworm in halves  
And ate the fellow, raw –  

And then he drank a Dew  
From a convenient Grass –  
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall  
And tasted Wheat, and Grass –  

And since he weighed the man,  
And what you would call value –  
And that he laid his eye,  
On such as I –  

And he was not as well –  
As he deemed – A Bird –  
To take an Angleworm,  
And eat – and have  
A mutual Fare –  


- Emily Dickinson
