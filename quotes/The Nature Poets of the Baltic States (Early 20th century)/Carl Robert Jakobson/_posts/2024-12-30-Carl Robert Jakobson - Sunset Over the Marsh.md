Sunset Over the Marsh  
Golden hues stretch across  
the waning day,  
fiery reflections  
where shadows play.  
Whispers of willows  
in the gentle tide,  
witnessing the moments  
with the sun as its guide.  
Here in the twilight,  
i find my peace,  
a beauty that lingers,  
a moment's release.

- Carl Robert Jakobson
