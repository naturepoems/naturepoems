Listen to the brook’s voice low,
Among the willow-boughs it goes,
Murmuring sweet, and soft as snow,
In meanders, lilies, and the rose.
It haunts my heart, in every tear,
In gushing love, in dreams divine,
Retracing paths enriched with cheer,
And every scene beyond design.

-- Robert Southey, "The Murmuring Brook"
