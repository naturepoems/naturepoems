Oh, the green earth, the billowing hills,
The fragrance of the morning dew;
Each breath I take my spirit fills,
With gratitude for all thatâ€™s true.

For every leaf that quakes at dawn,
For every bird that sweetly calls,
My heart shall soar, and naught be gone,
When Nature wraps me in her thralls.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
