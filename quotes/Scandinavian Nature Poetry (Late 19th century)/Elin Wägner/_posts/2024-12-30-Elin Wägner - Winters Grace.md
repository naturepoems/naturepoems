In winter’s white, the world is hushed,
A canvas blank, while time is brushed.
The snowflakes fall, a gentle kiss,
They blanket all in purest bliss.

In frosty air, the silence reigns,
As nature waits, with soft refrains;
With every flake, a dream takes flight,
In winter’s grasp, all feels just right.

- Elin Wägner
