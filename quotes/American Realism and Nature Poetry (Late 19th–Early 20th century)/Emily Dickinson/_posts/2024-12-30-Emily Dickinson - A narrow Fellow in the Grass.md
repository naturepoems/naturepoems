A narrow Fellow in the Grass  
Occasionally rides –  
You may see him by his Crease  
And his ungraspable Eyes –  

If you hold your Foot, and will –  
The Grass, after all, is green –  
And know can simply see –  
That is certainly too lean –  

But he is ever strange and dead;  
And who the Wanderers may be,  
Could as well have fallen mud –  
And perhaps be stirred again –  


- Emily Dickinson
