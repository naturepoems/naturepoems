Nature’s Symphony

In every breeze, a melody,
In rustling leaves, a soft refrain,
The rivers hum a tranquil note,
And nature sings free from all pain.

With every dawn, the chorus swells,
The world rejoices, life renews,
In harmony, our spirit dwells,
As simple joys the heart imbues.


- A R D Fairburn
