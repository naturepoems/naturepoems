To the Blue Jay

Thy voice is in the gale,
Thy sound the merry chime;
Thou bird of bright and bold,
How grand are thee,
In the quiet forest's hold.

Glinting through the leaves,
Like sapphire in the sun,
Thou dost spring with joy,
In the midday fun.

Through swaying boughs,
The sharp notes fly,
Resonant and loud,
Like laughter to the sky.

Thou speakest to the heavens,
In thy wild refrain,
Echoing the freshness,
Of the thunder's rain.

- Amelia Welby
