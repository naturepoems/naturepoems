To the Pine Tree

O lonely tree! thou art so still,
And yet thy age is great;
Thy trunk is gnarled, thy limbs are bare,
And yet thou art so straight.

The brook that wanders by thy base
Comes from the mountain top;
And see! thy roots, so deep and warm,
Have drunk the cooling drop.

- John G Whittier
