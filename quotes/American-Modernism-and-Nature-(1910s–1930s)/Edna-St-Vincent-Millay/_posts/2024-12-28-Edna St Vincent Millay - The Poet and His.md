The Poet and His Book

What is there to be learned from nature? 
    The streams do not know how to flow, 
And they weave gently along, and sing,
    Or lie peacfully talking; 
With shadows on the banks they lean,
    And sink; and they are green no longer.  
I hush your laughter, for it tells the fate of love
  And I kneel at this book of verse, as if to pray.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
