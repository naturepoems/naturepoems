Spring and All

By the road to the contagious hospital
under the surge of the blue
mottled clouds

crowding out the sky
of the leaves, the tortuous

yellow mulberry and the pale

surface of the roofs

of the patients’ walls,
are also the uncertainableness

departing, rising chemically

as summer is within
and we wrestle with gray autumn, 

bringing pearl

to this world while the wind
rattles the branches

and the gulls fold
at dawn between the seasons.

- William Carlos Williams
