The Serenity of the Pines  
In forest deep, where tall pines sway,  
A whisper floats, as soft as breath,  
Their needles flick, a dance of play,  
In quietude, the sacred depth.

O ancient woods, you hold the past,  
In rustling tales that gently flow,  
The moments still, where shadows cast,  
A tranquil heart can cease its woe.

The sunken trails that weave and wind,  
Where sunlight flares and nature sings,  
In every crack, a love divine,  
In every sigh, new hope it brings.

So let me wander, let me roam,  
In sacred groves, my heart shall find,  
The sweetest peace, the truest home,  
Among thy pines, my soul entwined.

- Richard Crashaw
