Adelstrop

Yes, I remember Adelstrop—
The name, because one afternoon
Of heat the express train drew up there
Unwontedly. It was late June.

The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.
No one articulated. But
A blackbird sang, and it was late
The note was like a step in the rut.

There was beauty here so unconfined,
And rows of socks on the long grass
As sunlight shimmered all around,
And from and into the tall grasses passed.

I remember Adelstrop; the blazing sun,
The damp bark of willow glistened fine,
Where tranquil summer poured, a time
When nature still held this world in line.

But shrouded now in autumn gold,
With stirred winds that dance alone,
I cherish this somewhere I behold—
Adelstrop, sweet and far from home.

- Edward Thomas
