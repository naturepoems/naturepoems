Winter
  
Beneath the warping sky so round,
The wind sings through the barren trees,
Yet winter’s too a beauty found
In quiet snow and icy breeze.

As the world, enwrapped in snowy dreams,
Feels the breath of summer wrap around,
While softly on the mountains gleams,
The stillness deep on every ground.

So pause to glory winter’s ride,
Along a hilltop dark and cold,
Where Nature sleeps, both calm and wide,
A lovely scene to grace the fold.

- James Russell Lowell
