For the Time Being

In the evening before the dawn
   in the wilderness the trees
are calling in the dark
   the earth is full of the earth
and the sunlight
   falls on the shadows
of the leaves—
   and still I go on sing.

It is the news of the sky
that I sing of the invisible
   infinitely soft
   infinitely mysterious
   at the bottom of the river
under the stars.


- W S Merwin
