quote: "The River Merchant's Wife: A Letter
While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.
You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,
You walked about my head, making the bodiless dreams.
Lilies and rue grew pale beneath our feet;"

The River Merchant's Wife: A Letter
While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.
You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,
You walked about my head, making the bodiless dreams.
Lilies and rue grew pale beneath our feet;
