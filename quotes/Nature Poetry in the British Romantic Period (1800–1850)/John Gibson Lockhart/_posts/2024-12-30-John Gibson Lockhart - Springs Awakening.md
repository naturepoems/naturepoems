SPRING’S AWAKENING

I.
She comes, she comes! with blooming light,
Fair Spring, on her way, all fragile and bright;
From dreams of white she wakes anew,
With color and warmth all smeared in the dew.

II.
With tender hands she spreads her light,
And opens fierce the flowers in sight;
While rivers swirl with motion and thrill,
With whispers of life, rolling down the hill.

III.
No longer the frost can stay her touch,
For branches ignite her kiss so much;
Awake the hills, behold the change,
For life now stirs in a spectrum strange.

IV.
O sing, where the field and dales unite,
Let bells ring out in the warm sunlight;
For her breath brings life, in joyous embrace,
Awake from the slumber to a Spring’s grace.

- John Gibson Lockhart
