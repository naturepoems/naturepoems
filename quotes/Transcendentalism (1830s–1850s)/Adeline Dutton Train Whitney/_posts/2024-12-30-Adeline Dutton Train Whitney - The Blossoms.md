The Blossoms
Upon the boughs of the trees
The blossoms do dance in the breeze,
Awakening dreams,
Fragrant and light,
In colors so pure,
A wondrous delight.
They arch toward the blue sky,
Their beauty makes grounds softly sigh,
Every petal a prayer,
Close to the earth,
Exhaling their sweetness,
Giving joy and mirth.
