Nature’s Unity

Among the trees,
the shadows gather,
yet in their arms,
a thousand stories are whispered.
Together they stand,
a communion of roots,
as the wind carries voices,
dreams of things yet untold.

There, under the canopy,
you will find stillness,
time suspended,
each leaf a memory,
a promise of life,
each branch a reminder
that we are bound
by earth and breath,
a harmony of flesh,
a continuity of spirit.

- Bertolt Brecht
