Silent the forest stands,  
under a blanket of stars.  
Whispers of leaves  
adorn the night,  
crickets sing  
a lullaby for the weary.  

In the stillness,  
a brook murmurs secrets,  
carrying tales of the mountain,  
a dance of stones and water,  
a life cascading,  
glistening in moonlight’s embrace.

- Nadia Słobodzian
