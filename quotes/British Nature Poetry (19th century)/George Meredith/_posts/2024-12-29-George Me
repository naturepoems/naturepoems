When raindrops fall like crystal beads, 
Upon the thirsty ground below, 
The earth awakens, life proceeds, 
And all that’s dull begins to glow. 

Through fields of green, the flowers sway, 
Released from summer's weary sighs, 
And in the freshness of the day, 
I find my heart, I feel the rise. 

So let me walk this path anew, 
Among the blooms that stretch to sky, 
In nature’s dance, I find my view, 
And in her arms, I long to lie.

- George Meredith
