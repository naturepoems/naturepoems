The Dance of the Seasons
Spring bows in with blossoms so sweet,
Summer follows with warmth and retreat.
Autumn dances in shades of gold,
Winter whispers, tales of the cold.

Each season a chapter in nature's grand book,
With stories of growth in each nook and crook.
From birth to decay, in cycles we find,
The essence of life, in the fabric entwined.

- Kwame Nkrumah
