In the forest, the ferns curl,
Like thoughts trailing,
Into the unknown.
Moss gathers in soft pockets,
Stained grey and green,
Where rabbits burrow,
Echoing life, the breath of leaves.
Each step, a careful tread,
We disturb the silence,
A quick flutter leaves,
A whisper of something
Spun in the web.
Oh what delight to walk
Among the mighty trunks,
Wrapped in wonder, a thread
Holding the breadcrumbs
Of youth—time stops,
In this embracing air.

- Margaret Atwood
