A Beautiful Day

  The sun is shining in the sky,
  The breeze is blowing oâ€™er the heath;
  The golden corn, so soft and dry,
  Is waving in the fields beneath;

  The blooming flowers with colors bright,
  Are smiling from their sunny beds;
  The trees are clothed in robes of light,
  And pleasant is the path that spreads.


- John Greenleaf Whittier
