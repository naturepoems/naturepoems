The Song of Wandering Aengus
I went out to the hazel wood,
Because a fire was in my head,
And I cut and peeled a hazel wand,
And hooked a berry to a thread;
And when white moths were on the wing,
And moth-like stars were flickering out,
I dropped the berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout.

When I had laid it on the bank
And it sat staring with its eyes,
I lifted the head and struck it, dead,
And I fell down to weep, because
I thought of the honey of her mouth,
The quiet of her eyes upon me,
The warm heart of her, and I had no joy,
Because I left her crying, all alone. 

I went out to the hazel wood,
Because a fire was in my head,
And I cut and peeled a hazel wand.
And hooked a berry to a thread;
And when white moths were on the wing,
And moth-like stars were flickering out,
I dropped the berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout.

- William Butler Yeats
