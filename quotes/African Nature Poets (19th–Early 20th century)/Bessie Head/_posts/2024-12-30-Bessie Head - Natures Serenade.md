NATURE’S SERENADE  
Listen to the sweet sounds of nature,  
The rustle of leaves,  
A soft melody played by the wind,  
Heralding the day’s grace.  

Birds sing praises in their tune,  
A symphony of life echoing  
In the valley, on the mountain,  
In the heart of the earth,  
Where harmony abounds.  


- Bessie Head
