quote: "Splintered skies pour down, 
Illuminated raindrops scatter,
Reflecting myriad worlds on green,
The symphony of life forces forth,
Every puddle, a universe,
Each ripple a dance—
The earth, swaddled by nurturing mists,
Keeps secrets of creation alive,
Life thrums in vibrant hues,
Awakened from its silent slumber."

Splintered skies pour down, 
Illuminated raindrops scatter,
Reflecting myriad worlds on green,
The symphony of life forces forth,
Every puddle, a universe,
Each ripple a dance—
The earth, swaddled by nurturing mists,
Keeps secrets of creation alive,
Life thrums in vibrant hues,
Awakened from its silent slumber.

- Mina Loy
