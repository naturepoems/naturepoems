Nightfall

With the sun’s retreat,
the world dons a velvet cloak,
as stars awaken,
specks of dreams scattered across the heavens.

The moon, a silent guardian,
glows with a knowing light,
a watchful eye reflected
on waters that sigh with ease.

In shadows, life stirs,
a rustle in the branches,
a chorus of crickets sings,
under the hush of twilight’s embrace.

Here, in the stillness,
we find the heart laid bare,
every breath a prayer,
yearning to connect with the infinite,
a piece of nature’s soul intertwined
within the fabric of midnight’s promise.
