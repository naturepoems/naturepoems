The hills a-bloom with gorse and thyme,
   Where lambs at play, in sunshine bask;
A pastoral scene, a gentle rhyme,
   In nature's heart, we find our task.

To tread the paths where wildflowers grow,
   And breathe in scents of earth and sky;
With every step, the sounds may flow,
   A symphony of life close by.


- L M T Aitken
