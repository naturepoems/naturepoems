The Human Drift

The tide of humanity flows through the wilderness, a current fierce and unrelenting in pursuit of dreams as the mountains loom; pure nature responds, timeless and unwavering, from dusk until dawn, embracing the struggle and the spirit, the harsh path of survival disclosing beauty beyond the labor of man, a clash of desires and instinct alike.

- Jack London
