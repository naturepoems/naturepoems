Green Hills

These hills are green and brown,  
  Sweet in the sun;  
  They lie in and out of  
 
MY heart so low,  
  All the songs that were sung  
  And died in their hollow.  
 
But  
  that I have known the wild  
  birds rise,  
And I have seen the last  
  part of the sun,  
 
I can never forget  
  the trails this heart goes on  
  in search of the old friends  
 
Who led me to their wings—  
  And they are gone,  
  and the hills are still,  
So low,  
  green and brown.
