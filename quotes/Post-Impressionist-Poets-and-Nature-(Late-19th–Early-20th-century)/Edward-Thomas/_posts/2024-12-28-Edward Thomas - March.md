March
O wild and sweet, O shout of spring,
Where brighter woods could never bring,
But in the wind’s warm, urgent cheer,
Sweet notes of life from far and near.

Each blade of grass now stirs anew,
Vibrates with each sunbeam’s hue,
And clouds drift lazily, as though
In blissful awe where blossoms grow.

- Edward Thomas
