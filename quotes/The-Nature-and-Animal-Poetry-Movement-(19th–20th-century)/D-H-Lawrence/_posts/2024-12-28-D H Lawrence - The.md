The Return

To the loveliness of nature I return;
To the breaking depth of the hills,
To the wind that stirs the bride’s laments,
And the solitude that reveals.

Nature speaks in unseen voices,
In the rustling of each leaf,
In the heart of the deepest forest,
Where there blossoms relief.

I long for freedom pure and free,
The clarity after the storm,
Where the essence of my being unfolds,
In the place where I am reborn.
