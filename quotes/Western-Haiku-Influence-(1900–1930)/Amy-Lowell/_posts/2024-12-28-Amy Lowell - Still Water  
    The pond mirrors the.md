quote: "Still Water  
    The pond mirrors the sky's pale hue,  
    A canvas of dreams where ripples play.  
    Each still water tells a story anew,  
    Reflecting the heart in a tranquil way.  

    Here I sit, with silence around,  
    Listening to whispers of what’s unsaid;  
    In nature's arms, I am bound,  
    Finding solace in the thread."

Still Water  
    The pond mirrors the sky's pale hue,  
    A canvas of dreams where ripples play.  
    Each still water tells a story anew,  
    Reflecting the heart in a tranquil way.  

    Here I sit, with silence around,  
    Listening to whispers of what’s unsaid;  
    In nature's arms, I am bound,  
    Finding solace in the thread.
