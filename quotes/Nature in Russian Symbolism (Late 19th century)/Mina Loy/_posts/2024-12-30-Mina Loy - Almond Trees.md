Almond Trees
Gnarled mud and sun,
the crumbled clay among
evening’s moist expansion;
you await the ripples
as shades of lavender sonnet;
your hearts and corridors exchange。
An immense longing blooms,
dried limbs swaying soft —
a ciphering at dusk,
as echoes of light dissolve,
layer upon layer 
receding into plenitude.
Between the hudding warm,
a dialogue bears dew,
and the twinkling silver kiss the flower,
as the moon churns a secret assignation.


- Mina Loy
