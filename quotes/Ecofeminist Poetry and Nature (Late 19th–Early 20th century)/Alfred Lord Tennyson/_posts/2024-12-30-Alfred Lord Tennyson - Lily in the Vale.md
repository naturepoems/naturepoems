Flower in the wood, sweet and white,
Lily of the vale, shine bright,
Scatter your blessings, tender dew,
Unfold your petals of silver hue.
Daylight dapples with gold the glade,
Keeps the whisper of dreams for the maid,
Where the birds make their solace of song,
In nature's arms, where we all belong.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
