After Apple-Picking
My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still,
And there's a barrel that I didn't fill
Beside it, and there may be two or three
Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.
But I am done with apple-picking now.

Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.
I cannot shake the shimmer of this thought,
If only it were a matter of the picking,
I would unpile the blackened sky,
And home would be a place of apples dripping.

I feel inclined to sleep, the smell of apples,
But I hear the flutter of wings,
The chill-pick flower of the moon.
I finish the idea of missing the harvest,
Of yielding to the blustering thoughts.
But I'm in a dream, it seems

- Robert Frost
