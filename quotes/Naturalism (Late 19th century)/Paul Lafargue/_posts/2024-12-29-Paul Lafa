As autumn leaves begin to fall,
They paint the earth, a vibrant shawl;
In hues of gold, a fleeting grace,
A testament to time's embrace.

The chilly air, a crisp delight,
Calls forth the hues of day and night;
In nature's dance, we find our thread,
As seasons shift, and life is led.

So let us walk this path with glee,
Embracing all that we can see;
For in the cycle of each year,
Is nature's song, forever dear.

- Paul Lafargue
