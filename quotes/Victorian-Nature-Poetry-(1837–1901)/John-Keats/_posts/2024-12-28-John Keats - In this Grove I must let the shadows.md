In this Grove, I must let the shadows breathe, 
The leaves descend as smooth as whispered dreams 
Amid the constellations close to earth, 
As sky and green together weave their songs— 
Such art! the spirits hide in paper light. 
So let me find close nature's heart sincere, 
Emerging from the darkest paths of night, 
To taste the sweet and iliad waters near. 
Let me believe the world; let all be right! 
The vivid essence flowing, free like air, 
A whisper's dance reflecting all we see, 
In this grove, no pain, no need for fear

- John Keats
