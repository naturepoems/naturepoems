Piano

Softly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;
Taking me back down the vista of years,
Until I see a child sitting under the piano
In the boom of the thunder, the original glow.

The dawn holds the starlight,
With the wind as the gentle flare.
The music strongly sways,
And the stars hum above me.

- Langston Hughes
