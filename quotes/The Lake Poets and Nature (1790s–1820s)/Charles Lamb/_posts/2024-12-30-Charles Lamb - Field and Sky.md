Field and Sky

When the morn is fresh and fair,
And the sun is bright and bold,
Upon the green fields everywhere,
Their stories sweet unfold.

The clouds like heavenly boats glide by,
Each cast a shade as they pass,
While the larks in joyous flight draw nigh,
To flit through the emerald grass.

How fair is Nature, how sweet and free,
With her bounteous gifts and charms,
She wraps the heart in sympathy,
And opens wide her arms.
