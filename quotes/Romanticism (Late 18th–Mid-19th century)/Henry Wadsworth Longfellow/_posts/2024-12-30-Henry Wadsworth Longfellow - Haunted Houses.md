Haunted Houses

All houses wherein men have lived and died  
Are haunted houses. Through the open door  
The ghosts look in, and see the living glide  
And hear the echoes of the days of yore.

They haunt the silence of the ancient rooms,  
And walk the darkened passages and wait  
For their return. Their phantoms and their glooms  
By day or night stand ever at the gate.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
