The Stars  

The stars shine bright in velvet skies,  
  A tapestry of dreams and fire;
  They twinkle forth their sweet surprise,  
  Like distant hearts that rise, aspire.

Let me not lose their gaze tonight,  
  For in their light, a promise gleams;
  Each flicker is a touch of light,  
  A solace found within our dreams.

Navigators of the heart,  
  They guide us through the darkened night;
  From every death, rebirth shall start,  
  In silence sung, in waves of light.
