The Weather

The weather is concocted
in the minds of men. 
We push aside the curtains 
if it is all.

It is all too terrible, 
whatever it is that it is. 
The sun comes up over 
everything and it
may be a little murder, 
a little deliverance.
The light pours into 
rainforest spaces
and chasms, there it hangs
on the neck of the earth,
all at once, more than.


- Robert Creeley
