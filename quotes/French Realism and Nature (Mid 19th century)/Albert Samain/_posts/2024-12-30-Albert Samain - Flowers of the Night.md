Flowers of the Night

Beneath the moon's soft, glowing hue,
There blooms a world, a secret sight,
Where night unfolds its velvet blue,
In the petals of flowers of the night.

Moonlit lilies reach for starlit skies,
Velvet softness sways in gentle sighs,
Each bloom a whispered breath of dreams,
In sacred silence, nothing redeems.

The fragrance lingers, sweet and pure,
An invitation to realms unknown,
Where heartbeats entwine, one can endure,
In the embrace of blossoms, gently grown.

Oh to be but a wanderer here,
In nightâ€™s embrace, let worries cease,
In the flowers' glow, there is no fear,
Only the promise, the sweet release.

- Albert Samain
