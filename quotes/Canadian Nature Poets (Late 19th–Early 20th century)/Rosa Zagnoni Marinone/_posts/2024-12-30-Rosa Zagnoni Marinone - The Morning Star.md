The Morning Star

O shining star, that to us leads
Our way across the night,
That to our hearts with longing pleads
For one more glimpse of light!

Thy beam of truth shall guide us on,
Through valleys deep and fair
Till, crowned at last with golden dawn,
We find Thee shining there.

- Rosa Zagnoni Marinone
