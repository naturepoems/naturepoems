Flora and Fauna Whisper
Beneath the arching willow’s sigh,
Creatures of wonder play and dwell,
In harmony with rustling greens,
As leaves weave tales they dare not tell.

A chorus of chirps and howls at twilight,
Echoes of life join the unfolding night,
Each whisper a song of existence,
In the heart of nature's delight.
