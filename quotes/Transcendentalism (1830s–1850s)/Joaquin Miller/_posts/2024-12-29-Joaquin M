The Twilight
The twilight whispers all around,
Where day meets night in soft embrace,
The flowers fold, in shadows drowned,
As close, the stars come join the chase.
In valleys deep and mountains high,
There falls a hush the heart can find,
While dreams like dew drops from the sky,
Float forth to free the quiet mind.

- Joaquin Miller
