Amidst the mountains standing tall,
Whisper winds, and echoes call,
Majestic pines, like sentinels, watch,
Underneath the sky's grand scotch.

The rivers carve their ancient trails,
As time slips by, and beauty prevails,
Each summit, every hidden glen,
Is nature's secret, again and again.

- Lytton Strachey
