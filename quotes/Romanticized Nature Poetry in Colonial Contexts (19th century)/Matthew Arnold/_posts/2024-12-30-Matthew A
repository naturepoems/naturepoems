The Fisherman

I dwell in the dew  
And the open sea—  
Through the surf I hurry fast;  
This is joy  
This is only dear salt air,
With  
hold this  
beneath the sky—
Barque of hope is water-drenched,   
Half hours and the shining looks.

Yet still my heart,  
Sees,  
Upon the restless  
Where joy flits, near from shore;  
For the gold of hope shall rest.

O nearer the hills of thy smooth brow,
Shall I harken backward  
On wild winds, tide of laughter,
For the seconds on days like dream,
Dwell upon the reflection bright?

So come farewell,  
To the dark old folding ship!
Let tide warm the waves with  
A blissful ache!
The golden sea shall  
Bear to me, peace!
  My pain finds light,  
Gone but still it stays in grace—  
Linger then on the blush of dawn!

- Matthew Arnold
