From mountains high to oceans deep,  
where heart and heartbeat join as one,  
our spirit weaves a tapestry,  
a journey linked, a web begun.
\nIn natureâ€™s arms, we find our way,  
a sanctuary, peace bestowed;  
with every step, we boldly sway,  
a path where all our hearts are flowed.

- John Dewey
