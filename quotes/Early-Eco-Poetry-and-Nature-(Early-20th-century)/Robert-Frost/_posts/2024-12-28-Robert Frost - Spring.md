Spring Pools
These pools that, though in forests, still reflect
The total sky almost without defect,
And like the flowers beside them, chill and pink,
If that were a flower that fell, but not the tree
From which we grew deep down round neighborhoods,
Do not forget. The next thing that you do, remember,
You must not share that comfortable silence,
But make up your mind by counting the colors,
Let the morning wake them, then break them.
The moment I came, what shadows now twine,
And what design meld back and forth from the ashes?

- Robert Frost
