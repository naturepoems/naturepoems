i carry your heart with me(i carry it in
my heart)i am never without it(anywhere
  i go you go,my dear;and whatever is done
   by only me is your doing, my darling)

                                              i fear
  no fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want
    no world(for beautiful you are my world,my true)

  and it’s you are whatever a moon has always
  meant and whatever a sun will always sing is you

   here is the deepest secret nobody knows

       (here is the root of the root and the bud of
the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life;
   which grows higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)

  and this is the wonder that’s keeping the stars apart

   i carry your heart(i carry it in my heart)

- E E Cummings
