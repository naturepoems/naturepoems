O love, if I could paint the scene,
The way the sunlight sifts between,
The branches green and flowers bright,
A canvas filled with pure delight.

Each stroke would echo nature’s grace,
The laughter found in every place,
For in this world, where beauty lies,
Exists the art that never dies.


- Alfred Edward Housman
