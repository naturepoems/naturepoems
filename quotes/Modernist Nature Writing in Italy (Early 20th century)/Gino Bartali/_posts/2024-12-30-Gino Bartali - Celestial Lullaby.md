In the quiet of the night,  
the moon reigns supreme,  
a silver sentinel,  
watching over the dreaming earth.  
Stars twinkle like secrets,  
a celestial map  
of all that has been,  
and all that will be.  

Night has a voice,  
a melody of shadows,  
a lullaby for the wanderers  
seeking solace,  
a refuge in the stillness.

- Gino Bartali
