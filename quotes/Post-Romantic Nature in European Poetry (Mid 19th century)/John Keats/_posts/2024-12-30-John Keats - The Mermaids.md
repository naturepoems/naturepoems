The Mermaids

Sailing leaf, bring thy season near,  
Unto sky once blue, now amber-clear.  
When I hear the clarion call of the deep,  
And the dance along the coral reefs so keep.  
A treasure awake, twinkling through the brine,  
Beneath the world where the ocean's shining signs  
Are graced to circulate the tender soft wind  
With each role of rhythm as heart beats find.

â€” The Mermaids

- John Keats
