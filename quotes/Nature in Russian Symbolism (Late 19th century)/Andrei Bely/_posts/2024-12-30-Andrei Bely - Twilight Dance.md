Above the earth, the skies unfurl, 
In colors crashing, a dance, a whirl.
The sun dips low, in fire’s twirl, 
While stars awaken from their pearl.

The night creeps in, so softly sewn, 
With moonlit threads, the darkness grown.
In this shroud, my heart has flown, 
In nature’s arms, I feel at home.

Each breath a token, each glance divine, 
As night overtakes the fading shine.
In harmony, my soul entwines, 
With nature's spirit, forever mine.

- Andrei Bely
