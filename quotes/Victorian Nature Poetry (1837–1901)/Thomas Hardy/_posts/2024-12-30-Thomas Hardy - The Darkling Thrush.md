The Darkling Thrush

I leant upon a coppice gate
When Frost was spectre-grey,
And winter's dregs made desolate
The weakening eye of day.

The tangled bindweed flung a shroud
Over the writhing thorn,
And the sad, smitten ground was bowed
With the weight of its forlorn.

When I heard from an aged thrush
A melancholy tune
An hourly one; and, as he sang,
The sorrowful moon

Grew a black cloud upon the gloom.

In spite of this, I felt, there is
A joy for the world beyond his thrill;
The throbbing heart both stilled and swayed,
And my soul by his song lay still.

There starts through my head this strange song,
A eulogy of the dust, the chill,
And the determined steel to follow on.

But the thrush breaks the eternal night:
A critical moment had sprung still,
The heaviness gone of earth and night,
And I find no time to disturb the chill.

- Thomas Hardy
