Fair daffodils, we weep to see
You haste away so soon;
As yet the early-rising sun
Has not attained his noon.

Stay, stay, until the hasting day
Has run
But to the even song;
And, having prayed together, we
Will make a day long.

And you, sweet flowers, do you not see
How soon your blossoms fade?
For, as that season does, so shall
Your beauty be betrayed.

Then stay, sweet flower, and let
Your fragrance linger long,
'Til the hour of evening be,
And dusk sings evening song.

- Robert Herrick
