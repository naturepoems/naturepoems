A few, but oh! how few, there are
Who live in peace and simplicity,
Far from the battle's cruel scar,
Within the forest’s canopy.

There Nature breathes her balmy air,
Where the trees with grace entwine,
And with whispers soft as any prayer,
Invite us to the divine.

Let me wander in those woods,
Where the wild birds sing their tune,
Among the leafy solitudes,
Beneath the crescent moon.

- William Wordsworth
