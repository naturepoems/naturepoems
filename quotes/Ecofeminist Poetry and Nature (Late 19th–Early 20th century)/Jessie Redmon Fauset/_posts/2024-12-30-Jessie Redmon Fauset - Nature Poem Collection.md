Fascinated and Bewildered
I am a sunflower
     facing the sun,
How could I ever know you?
What is wild and free
    is never understood.
Yet here I stand in my silent
    majesty, 
Wait for you to take
    a moment's pause.
Under the blue sky, 
     reaching outward 
In blissful ignorance, 
     I face my only 
Sunlit Lord—
     your back turned,
     there is no anger; 
only the wind that sways me.

The Poetry of Nature
In this vastness,
     I listen to the trees,
I hear their whispers,
    as if they know my name.
Leaves with gentle voices,
    telling secrets sweet;
The world around me,
    alive, a living thing.
Birds sing anew each dawn,
    their joy unfurled,
As we dance through a garden,
    wise like Pear tree,
    young like the rose,
    strong as the oak.
---

Lilies
Each petal a soft promise,
    the lily blooms,
Delicate, poised, alive—
Sonorous notes in the breeze.
Kissed by dew of the dawn,
    in silver light it gleams;
A lily unfolding,
    dreams whisper low,
The world boundless, below.
---

Hyacinth
All fragrances blend,
     land and sky, together,
I breathe, too, the music,
    in the air is vibrato.
Nature's stringed harmony
    plucking at my heart,
In a garden of shadows,
    even in silence I thrive.
---

The Meadow
Here in the meadow,
    I see earth at its play;
The wildflowers sway,
    under the watchful sun,
Nature's vast chorus sings,
    alive in resonance,
My spirit entwined
    with the beauty that lives,
A pulse shared with the world.
---

Autumn Leaves
Golden ochre falls,
    as the season shifts,
A dance of death and birth,
    painting the ground,
Each leaf a farewell,
    soft, sweet surrender,
To the whispering wind,
     that carries me onward,
Each crumbling piece whispers,
     it's time for rest.
---

Wistful Dawn
At dawn, as beauty breaks,
    the light creeps,
Whispering to the petals—
    time to awaken.
Nature stretches, yawns soft,
A calm breath to the world,
This tranquil moment,
    the heartbeat of earth,
And I, a witness,
    stand in silent awe.
---

Evening's Embrace
As dusk falls,
     I hear the rustling leaves,
Nature's lullabies weave
    stories of the day, 
Each whisper holds magic,
      sweet and low;
Each star above,
    a promise yet to be—
The world slows, 
    wrapped in love and light.
---

The Autumn Moon
A silver gleam,
    a mirror in the sky,
The autumn moon glows,
    in the still of the night.
A vestige of warmth,
    she whispers in dreams,
Holding close the seasons,
    like soft silk gauze.
---

Roses
Fragrant blooms in the night,
    their beauty surrounds,
Gentle to the touch,
    a softness profound,
Pink and red like sunsets,
    hues of longing and grace;
I find myself ensnared
    in the maze of their essence.
---

Reflections
Amid the trees,
    my mind recollects,
Nature's mirror reflecting,
    all that is divine,
I reach for the branch that bends,
    in a dance with the clouds,
Echoes of laughter,
    in the whispers of winds.
---

Glimpse of Wonder
Oh, the joy I find,
    nestled in the green,
The fields like oceans,
    swaying to the tides,
Life moves effortlessly,
    under a joyous sun,
In nature, there is peace,
    and a glimpse of wonder.
---

Whispers of Spring
Amidst the melting snow,
    life beckons return,
Delicate as the crocus,
    breaking through soft clay,
Each bud a promise,
    nurtured by the warmth,
As spring unfolds like a tale,
    precious and pure.
---

Chasing Shadows
In the forest, I chase
    the dappled light,
Where shadow dances
    beneath ancient boughs,
Breath of the earth,
    a sacred embrace,
Each rustle a testament,
    to the unseen life.
---

The Sky
Above me—endless, 
a canvas of dreams,
Streaks of color painting,
    the aspirations of life,
The clouds, wandering
    spirits, freeing their thoughts,
And I, beneath their gaze,
    stand humbled in awe.
