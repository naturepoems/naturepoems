Birches
When I see birches bend to left and right
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,
I like to think some boy's been swinging them.
But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.
Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
After a rain. They click upon themselves
As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.
Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells
Shattering and avalanching on the snow crustâ€”
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,
And they seem not to me to be the happy leaves
But the sad leaves, crushed and dormant, not seeking,
Not hollering, not trembling, just hanging still,
Oblivious or unconscious like the frozen river.
Yet I would like, to hope their roots reach down,
So far they know the joy of being loved
With all the burdensome excessive love that weighs,
So when they bend they know it is this love
That stirs them back to life, the sap returning.
Only a boy, a boy's the only one.

The boy swings straight at school, at first,
And sees them as he passes, hardly stops,
And slings with flying shoulders at the wire,
Thrilled by their leaves that open and close with motion,
Nothing like the girls who lie by flowers,
Who can stand and sway with all their lovely hair,
Swallowing truth about the green and spilled sun.
But he will not know what makes the world go round
And leaves fall smooth as softly as they should,
He only remembers how to climb, enough for life.
