The harvest moon is rising high,
In autumn’s golden glow,
And fields are dressed in purple sighs,
With grain and fruit below.

The world has shifted in its dance,
As nature takes her bow,
And in the silence, there’s a chance
To cherish every now.

Let us give thanks for all we’ve known,
In every season’s flight,
For in the beauty we have grown,
Our spirits find their light.

- John McCrae
