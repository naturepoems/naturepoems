O WORLD, I CANNOT HOLD THEE CLOSE ENOUGH

O world, I cannot hold thee close enough!
Thy winds, thy wide grey skies!
A million little wings
Flutter like that of sunlight.
And jays that wound the air,
Honk, and tremble in the breeze.

O world, I cannot hold thee close enough!
Nor share the lovely dawns.
I wish to cast my life behind,
And breathe the fragrant air, till night falls down,
With all the dripping green,
Exuding oil and bloom.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
