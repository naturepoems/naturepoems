Bright star! would I were steadfast as thou art—
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like nature’s loveliness bathed in silver light.

The light of beauty drapes the heavens wide,
And I, the dreamer lost, stand here alone;
In thy vast splendor, show me where to glide.
With thee, dear star, I can call the world my own.

Tis in thy light I find my quiet place,
Where hearts entwined and whispers soft resound,
In the sacred temple of of life’s embrace,
In nature’s love, our souls forever bound.

- John Keats
