Spring

O, for a garden full of flowers!
O, for a bank of violets blue!
O, for the green, sweet glades of ours,
That meet the wild-flower with the dew!

Where he that bathes in summer sun,
Will roam among the jocund isle,
In fragrant hedges, one by one,
To own the loveliness that smiles.

With mind that’s wild and heart that’s free,
O, come, I’d wander with the charm,
And in the shade so riant be,
In nature’s beauty lost and warm!

- John Clare
