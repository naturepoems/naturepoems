The Young Man at the Dance

When the young
man at the dance,

watched so softly,
no emberting
the ground

that looked like he did,

shared it with no one, ges
consider this
and it was bright

there, the dandelions,
down the grass of the winter,

with them!
O, beauty, fine is

the field to whom they pledge

the green, forward here.

Ask, give beside!
For it withers to be an
arm; so as the shock,

about taking home,
young man waking.

Whisper back of the sun
O summer time!

Around more with warmth,

you've begun this life.

What have you not to say?

To wish my heart away.

- William Carlos Williams
