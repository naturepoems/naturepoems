To be in tune with nature,
Is the highest of aspirations;
With each petal that unfurls,
A hidden world awakens—  
As I stand beside the lake,
To drink in the reflections,
The clouds shape stories above,
Creative, flowing, alive—
And I, so tiny, yet infinitely vast,
Become part of this design,
As I breathe deeply,
The essence of being blooms within.

- Henry David Thoreau
