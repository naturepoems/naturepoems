My soul is dark—Oh! quickly string
The harp I yet can brook to hear;
And let thy gentle fingers bring
Some sweet and sad ephemeron near—

By the perfect shade of the willow tree,
By the embers of fading fire,
That burns up the night to set me free,
And feed the sad end of desire.

For all the flowers of night are spread,
Beneath the deep river’s calm embrace,
And nothing can pass but the tides of the dead
That search for a faraway place.

Dark is the night, ere the tempests arise,
But hearts find rest in the shadows of pain;
So continue to reason with stars in the skies,
While nature deals forth both joy and disdain.  


- Lord Byron
