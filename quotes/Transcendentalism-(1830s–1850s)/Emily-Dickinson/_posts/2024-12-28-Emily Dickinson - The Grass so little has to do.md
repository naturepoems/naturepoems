The Grass so little has to do,  
A Sphere of simple Green –  
Yet offer all the time to grow,  
And marvel of the Scene –  

It could be darker, could be blue  
And spin like Human Year –  
But when it doesn't –  
None, I know –  
It chooses not to drear –  

Like perfect Happiness –  
Untouched by its own worth –  
And when it changes, lost and deep –  
My home,  
My Earth!  
—Emily Dickinson
