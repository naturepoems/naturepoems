A Summer Day

What beauty in this summer day,
Where sunlight dances on the stream,
And every flower sings its play,
Reflecting nature's golden dream.

With laughter bright, the children run,
The sky above is vast and true,
In every heart, warmth of the sun,
In every glance, a sky of blue.

- Marjorie Pickthall
