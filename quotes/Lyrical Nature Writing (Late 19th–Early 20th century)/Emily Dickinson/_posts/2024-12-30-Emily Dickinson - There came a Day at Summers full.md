There came a Day at Summer's full—  
Entirely for me—  
I found it in the Garden—  
I wonder if it bore  

A single sign, a single soul  
Within its Leafy shade—  
Full Summer was among the Bees  
And tranquility found.  

It seemed just now to give me,  
Not peaches hung with dew—  
But showers of fragrant beauty  
And oh, they circled me—  


- Emily Dickinson
