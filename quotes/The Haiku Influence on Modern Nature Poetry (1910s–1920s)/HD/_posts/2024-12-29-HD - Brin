Bring your waves here, unfurl their call—
Near rivers undulating with peacefulness,
The green grass sways with a joy of neighbor—
These are the softest moments of time—
Where curls, shadows, flow together,
And sure, let the sun cast crosses round;
Let me dive into dreams, wrapped and cozy,
As deep as memory’s coming lullaby—
Traces of birds, echoing trills, will meet,
In the silence of dusk’s final breath.
