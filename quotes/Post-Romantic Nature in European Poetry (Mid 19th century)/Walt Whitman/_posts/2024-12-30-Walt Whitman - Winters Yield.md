As winter yields to the spring's embrace,
The world awakens from its slumbered sleep,
Each bud and bloom bursts forth, a trace,
Of harmony and love the earth shall keep.

Nature's cycle, both fierce and mild,
The tender heart of a nurturing womb,
In darkness and joy alike, we are styled,
In life's great dance, where all shall bloom.

So join the revel in this grand parade,
With each step taken, our fears laid down,
For in the garden, where we are made,
Life's beauty blossomed, free from frown.

- Walt Whitman
