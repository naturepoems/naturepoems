A Child’s Question

Why is the sky so blue?
Why do rivers run free?
Why does the world spin for me,
like a dance in the arms of my mother?

The mountains rise like giants,
echoes of ancient song,
but is the earth not a cradle,
a womb of whispers and echoes,
a home for us all?

So speak, Speak,
make the world visible,
for the child within, for the beauty,
the gentle rhythm of nature,
the laughter of leaves dancing.

Oh, how I long to hold
that profound secret,
that the forest knows all
and the horizon, wraps me
in its arms of whispering winds.

- Bertolt Brecht
