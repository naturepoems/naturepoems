The River

In gentle flow, the river glides,  
It weaves through valleys bright and wide;  
Reflecting all the skies above,  
A melody of perfect love.  

The glittering waves dance on its face,  
Moving through grassy, whispering grace,  
With warmth of sun and gentle rain,  
In every curve, life’s sweet refrain.  

In harmony the waters sing  
From every depth their surety bring,  
Thou lead to wonders unexplored,  
Within the hearts of those adored.
