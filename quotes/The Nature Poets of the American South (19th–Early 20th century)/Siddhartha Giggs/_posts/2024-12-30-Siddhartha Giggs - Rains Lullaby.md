A single raindrop, a dance on the ground,
Brings life to the earth, a soothing sound.
The storm clouds gather, a thrilling display,
Nature’s fierce beauty, wild and free-played.

After the tempest, a rainbow ignites,
A promise of peace in the soft, gentle nights.
In storms and in calm, through joy and through pain,
I find the rhythm of nature’s refrain.


- Siddhartha Giggs
