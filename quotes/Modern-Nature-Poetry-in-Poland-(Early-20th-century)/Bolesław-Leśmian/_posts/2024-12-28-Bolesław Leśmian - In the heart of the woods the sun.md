---

In the heart of the woods, the sun flickers,
Dancing through green canopies with bliss,
And secrets breathe in the silence, thick as liquor,
Among roots unsung in the tender abyss.

Leaves rustle like whispers, ancient and wise,
Telling tales that the wildflowers spin,
In a language that only the heart knows,
Where every echo feels like a sin.


- Bolesław Leśmian
