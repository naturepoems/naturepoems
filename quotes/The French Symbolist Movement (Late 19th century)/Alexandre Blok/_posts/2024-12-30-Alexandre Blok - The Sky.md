The Sky

Above the pale gray horizon,
Where twilight gives a sigh,
The birds dance timidly upon
The canvas of a muted sky.

The clouds, like dreams of misty lore,
Unravel, then reweave anew,
As nature's brushstroke seeks to score
The wonder of each fading hue.

Let the winds, a soothing balm,
Shatter the night's growing fright;
As stars, heralds of serenity,
Blink gently upon the endless night.

- Alexandre Blok
