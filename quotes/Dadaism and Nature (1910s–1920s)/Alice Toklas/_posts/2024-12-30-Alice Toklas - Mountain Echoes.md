Upon the mountain's peak,
or in the valley deep,
I surrender myself
to nature's artistry,
a canvas painted
in wild strokes, 
a testament to chaos—a Dadaist dream.

Wildflowers brave,
boundless and bold,
nestled in the cracks,
triumphant against the odds,
the wind carries the scent
of possibility,
a breath of life.

What wonders dwell
in the silence,
what stories hide
in the quiet rustle,
where the heart beats
in time with the universe,
an echo of existence.

Let me stand here,
a solitary figure,
within this vastness,
a pulse of belonging,
a thread within the tapestry,
infinite and eternal.

Life painted wild,
a reminder that we are
part of everything,
each moment a brushstroke,
each breath a verse,
each heartbeat a note
in nature’s grand symphony.

- Alice Toklas
