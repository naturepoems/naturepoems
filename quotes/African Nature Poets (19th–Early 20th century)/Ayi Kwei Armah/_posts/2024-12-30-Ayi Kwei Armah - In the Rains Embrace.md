A sky laden with clouds, 
    a curtain of gray, 
    hushed whispers in the atmosphere, 
    as rain teases the earth, 
    a lover’s gentle caress.

Puddles gather stories, 
    reflecting shapes of the past, 
    while the earth drinks deeply, 
    reviving veins long parched.  

In the scent of wet earth, 
    the promise of renewal blooms, 
    a constant reminder, 
    that life is a cycle, 
    forever turning, 
    always beginning anew.
