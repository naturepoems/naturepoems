Ode to the West Wind  
O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,  
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead  
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,  
Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,  
Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,  
Who chariotest to their chariot-thrones  
The kings of kings, and the powerful of the earth,  
The dead leaves are driven before the tempest's howl.
