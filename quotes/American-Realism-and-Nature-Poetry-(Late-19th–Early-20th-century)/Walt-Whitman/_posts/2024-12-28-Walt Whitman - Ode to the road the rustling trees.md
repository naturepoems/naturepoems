Ode to the road, the rustling trees,  
  The coolness of dusk unfolding,  
My steps are as gentle as flowing streams,  
  The infinite blue above me spreading.  

Ode to the hills and valleys deep,  
  Where time breathes still and hidden,  
I pause in the comfort of their embrace,  
  The softest music ever given.  


- Walt Whitman
