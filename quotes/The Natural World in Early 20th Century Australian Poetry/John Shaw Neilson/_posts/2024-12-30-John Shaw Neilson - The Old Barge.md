The Old Barge

Where reeds grow thick upon the shore,
    The old barge lies aground,
Its magic sails will rise no more,
    Its secrets must be found.

But still it holds the tales of yore,
    With whisperings of the sea;
So come, let us our dreams explore,
    And set our spirits free.

- John Shaw Neilson
