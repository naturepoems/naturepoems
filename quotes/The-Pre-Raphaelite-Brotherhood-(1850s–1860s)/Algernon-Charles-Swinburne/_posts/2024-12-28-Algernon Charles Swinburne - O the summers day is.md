O the summer's day is dying,
And the stars are breaking out,
With the silent feet of night;
The flowers close their petals,
And the leaves hang down, all still,
As if the world were sleeping.

O the roses long to rest,
In soft repose of darkness,
And the air to hush its breath
As if to drink a draught of night.
- From "The Garden of Proserpine"

- Algernon Charles Swinburne
