In gardens green, where treasures bloom,
 A world of color sighs for room.
 The lilies rise, their banners fly,
 To greet the azure of the sky.

 The bees hum low in fragrant air,
 As petals dance without a care;
 Each whispered breeze that flits about
 Is nature's song, a joyous shout.


- Roger Fry
