The Silent Pond

O tranquil pond, so still and deep,
Reflecting skies of azure blue;
In your embrace, my secrets keep,
Where the world fades to just you.

The lily pads, like dreams afloat,
Bring beauty to your silent grace;
In every ripple, I will float,
To find my sacred place.

- Rosa Zagnoni Marinone
