The Voice of the Rain
Love hath illumin'd the sky of stars:
On life’s age-worn arch, paths both chill'd and scorn’d  
Of long-held breath, whose echoes have scarred  
Wisdom framed, fell sucked on earth’s wide dawns,
            
Soft-psyche’s murmur in each rhyme retake  
Sleep where pure peeps from lull’d hills would wake--
Rename thy heart; so love sets farude’s feel,
Along hearts of tender trees shake by the gale.

Nay, thine anxious morn push forward slow!  
Amid these branches shield, recorded lays;  
For storms there crown moon's dimm'd blow  
And time held all with would-be praise: 

Range softly breathe, hence arise—again!  
By rising suns on soothed paths amain,  
Little streams, meek, rising as they flow,  
I grow uncaged, tranquil as blooms’ refrain!

- Thomas Hardy
