The River-Merchant's Wife: A Letter
While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
   I played at the front gate, pulling flowers.
You came by on a red-leaved and brown-scented dragon,
   And you looked at me and passed on without speaking.

When I was a little girl,
     I served you tea in the afternoon,
But when I made my presentable farewell
   I turned my head and wept, wistfully,
Bowing my head in my own way; 
   Now I am seventeen, and you will soon be back.

Once you rode away to the far rivers
   Through the pass, and when you came back,
         I waited too long, now you are gone.
I can only hope that your strength and your power
   Will bring you swiftly back to me again.

- Ezra Pound
