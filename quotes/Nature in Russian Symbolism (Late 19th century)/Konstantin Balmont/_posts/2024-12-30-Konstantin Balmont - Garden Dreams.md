In the garden where the lilies sway,
  The bees hum songs of joy divine,
  Each petal trembles with the magic,
  Each leaf is scribbled with a sign.
  
  The fragrance of the earth is bidding,
  The sky embraces every hue,
  And as I wander in this beauty,
  My heart blooms wild, my spirit too.

- Konstantin Balmont
