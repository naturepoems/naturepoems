Mid-Day

In the afternoon,
an hour of the sun,
I am glad,
let me dwell with you.
Oh, the greens of the trees!
The blossoms that feed
on the warmth and glow.

Let me escape,
in the shimmer down the trail,
delicious mint and honeysuckle—
it is summer,
through the white and burning,
not yet dazed by the long light,
the sweetness, bitterness,
apples and flowers,
which speak to me then,  
when light creeps to the brink.
