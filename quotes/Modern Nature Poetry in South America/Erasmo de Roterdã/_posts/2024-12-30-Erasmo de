In desert sands where silence reigns,
The sun paints tales of fierce delight,
Each grain a story, like life’s pains,
In nature’s grasp, we learn to fight.

Cacti bloom in rugged grace,
A hard-fought beauty, fierce and bold,
In every thorn, we find our place,
In nature's tale, our lives unfold.

- Erasmo de Roterdã
