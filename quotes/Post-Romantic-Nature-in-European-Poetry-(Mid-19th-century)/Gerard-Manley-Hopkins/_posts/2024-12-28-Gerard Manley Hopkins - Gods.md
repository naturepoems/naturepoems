God’s Grandeur

The world is charged with the grandeur of God. 
    It will flame out, like shining from shook foil; 
    It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil 
    Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod? 
    Generations have trod, have trod, have trod; 
    And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil; 
    And wears man's smudge, and shares man's smell: the soil 
    Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod. 
    And all the earth is brimming with the beauty of God 
    And I can see it all, spilling from heaven's hand; 
    But my soul, too, sardonic and cynical! 
    These moments hang like all that’s good and grand!  
    The world is charged with the grandeur of God.  

                                                        -- Gerard Manley Hopkins, 1877
