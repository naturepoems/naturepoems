In the woods too dark to see
And where the blacker radios hum,
I say to the trees, “Speak to me!”
And light up the night like a star.

Under the lash or brazen moon
The shooting stars fly thick today, 
The beauties they bring seem too soon
And then the bright showers bock from the sky.

But when it rains the leaves reek
And rags are laden in underbrush.
I go to pieces at the frightful creek
And hear the bodies go out in hush.

- Robert Frost
