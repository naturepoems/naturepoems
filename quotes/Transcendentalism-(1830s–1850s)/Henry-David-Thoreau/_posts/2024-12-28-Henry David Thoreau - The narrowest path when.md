The narrowest path when walked,
Becomes a road less trod—  
And each step I take does echo 
In the sacred woods,  
Here I am but a traveler,  
Who converses with the trees,
And listens to their wisdom,  
Such knowledge fills me anew,
With the wonder of the earth,  
And the life that dances,
In every breeze.

- Henry David Thoreau
