The night sky unfolds,
each star a distant dream,
infinite, ungraspable,
yet within reach,
reminding me of my place
in this grand scheme.

The moon glows softly,
a nurturing presence,
the guardian of shadows,
as crickets serenade
the cool darkness,
each note a love song
to the night.

In this stillness,
I find my heartbeat,
a conversation with the universe,
a gentle reminder
that all life is sacred,
each moment a bright point
in this endless tapestry.

- Alice Walker
