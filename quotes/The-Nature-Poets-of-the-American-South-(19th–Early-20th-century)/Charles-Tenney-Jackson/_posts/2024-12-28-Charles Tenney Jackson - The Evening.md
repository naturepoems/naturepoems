The Evening Star
A wistful star appears at dusk,
Her silvery whispers light the way,
Among the trees, the brooks that rush,
She guides the weary traveler’s sway.

With tender notes of soft adieu,
The breezes sigh through branches wide,
To call to heart the dreams anew,
Where shadows gather, peace beside.

The world below is hushed and calm,
As Nature holds her night in thrall,
A serenade, a soothing psalm,
In quiet moments, we hear her call.

—Charles Tenney Jackson
