Autumn Song

The autumn leaves are drifting
   In a golden, crimson blaze;
They dance upon the breezes,
   In the light of shorter days.

With every rustling whisper,
   Of leaves that twirl and fall,
A symphony of nature
   Is played for one and all.

The trees stand clad in colors,
   Like flames ’gainst azure sky;
In the golden hour of twilight,
   I watch the moments fly.

O let me glean from autumn’s heart,
   The wisdom of her glow;
For in the soft surrender,
   I find the peace I know.

- Lizette Woodworth Reese
