In the Meadow

In the meadow where daisies boast,
Amongst the blooms of summer's grace;
I feel the sky, and the earth the most,
While time unfolds in a sweet embrace.

With each whispered breeze, dreams arise,
In simple glades where the quiet dwells;
With laughter bright like bluebird cries,
While nature's harmony ever swells.

The rolling hills stretch far and wide,
While shadows dance with the setting sun;
In the meadow where the world confides,
A song eternal is softly spun.

- Wilfrid Wilson Gibson
