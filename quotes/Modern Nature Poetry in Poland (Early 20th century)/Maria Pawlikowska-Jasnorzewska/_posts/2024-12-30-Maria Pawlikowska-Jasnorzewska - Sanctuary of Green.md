Under the spreading branches of an oak,
I found a corner of the world,
a sanctuary of green,
beyond the chaos of life.
The wind, like a gentle friend,
rustled my hair, laughed with me.

Here amongst wildflowers,
I could shed my burdens,
become like a butterfly,
flitting, free,
searching only for light,
or a single drop of dew.

Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
