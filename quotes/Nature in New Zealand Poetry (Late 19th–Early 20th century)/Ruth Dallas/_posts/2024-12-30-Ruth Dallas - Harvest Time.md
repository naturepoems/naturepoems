The fields are gold with the harvest's grace,  
Where the sun pours warmth on the ripened grain;  
In this rich bounty, I know my place,  
As love blooms bright in the soft refrain.  

The scents of earth and the sunset’s glow  
Bring forth the memories of simpler days;  
In this farmland's soul, my heart does flow,  
And I am woven into nature's ways.

- Ruth Dallas
