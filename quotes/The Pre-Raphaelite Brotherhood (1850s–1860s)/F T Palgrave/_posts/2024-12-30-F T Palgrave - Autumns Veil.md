Autumn’s Veil
Beneath the boughs of autumn’s grace,  
With leaves that shimmer, fall, and trace  
A carpet rich in hues so bold,  
A story of summer’s tale retold.  
The twilight air, with scents so clear,  
Whispers of harvests, drawing near;  
An amber glow, the sun descends,  
As nature’s beauty subtly bends.  
Let us walk this path of quiet hues,  
And gather ‘round the golden views.  
In autumn’s arms, a fleeting dream,  
We pause to savor life’s bright gleam.  


- F T Palgrave
