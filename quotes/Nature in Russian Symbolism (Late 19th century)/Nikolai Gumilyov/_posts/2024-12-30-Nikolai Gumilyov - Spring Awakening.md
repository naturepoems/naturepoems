Spring Awakening

When spring returns with tender breath,
And life awakens from its sleep,
The bloom of flowers, defying death,
In every corner, promises seep.

The birds return, a sweet refrain,
In joyful chorus, hearts align,
Nature's palette, bright and plain,
As every bud begins to shine.

In meadows lush, the sun does dance,
On skies so blue, a masterpiece,
And in this wondrous, fleeting chance,
The essence of true life finds peace.

Oh spring, dear harbinger of fate,
As life renews in every hue,
With open arms, we celebrate,
Your gift of hope, forever true.

â€“ Nikolai Gumilyov
