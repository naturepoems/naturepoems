Meditation

What sweet colors and perfumes await me,
In this soft shining of the starry nights,
The whisper of leaves, the joy that draws me close,
Amid the curls of smoke my heart ignites.

O Nature, with your guise so fair and wise,
Who steals art and the melodies sublime,
You carry me closer beneath your jeweled skies,
Molding hearts with rhythmic, softening chime.


- Charles Baudelaire
