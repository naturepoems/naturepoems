The sky stirs as evening stretches,
merging, fading into dusk's embrace.
A lullaby of crickets floats in,
muting thoughts and planting stillnessâ€”


a moment to breathe deeply,
a silence that cradles the world,
for all around is turning,

and I am just a passerby,
yearning for the pulse of night
to weave me close in shadows.
