In the Woods

Into the woods, I venture anew,  
Where the air is fresh and alive,  
Among the whispers, in nature's view,  
Where the heart and the mind can thrive.

A symphony stirs as the branches sway,  
In concert with rustling leaves;  
Where I seek solace at the end of the day,  
In all that the Earth believes.

So here, in the woods, I reach for grace,  
Knowing each step is sacred ground;  
In the depths of the trees, I find my place,  
In the magic of nature, blessed and unbound.
