The wild winds whisper through the swaying trees,
Like secrets shared between old, knowing friends.
They dance in the air, a tune on the breeze,
In every rustle, where nature transcends.

With branches that bow and leaves that applaud,
They share in the laughter, the joy of the day.
In their sacred communion, a truth is bestowed,
That life is a journey, come what may.

- Anna Brigadere
