The grasp of winter, cold and profound,
Wraps the world in crystals, bright and stark,
Yet life whispers softly beneath the ground,
In the hushed embrace of the icy dark.

Snowflakes drift softly, a ballet in white,
Blanketing earth in a soothing shroud,
Each flake a promise of spring’s warm delight,
Nature slumbers gently beneath the cloud.

- Andrejs Panteļeevs
