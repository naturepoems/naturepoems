When the Lilac Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d

When the lilac last in the dooryard bloom’d,
And the great star early droop’d in the western sky in the night,
I mourn’d—and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring.

Again and again shall I bring thy message, O deep stars,
The answer to my sacred longing.
The earth is ever the same,
As I look into the heavens.


- Walt Whitman
