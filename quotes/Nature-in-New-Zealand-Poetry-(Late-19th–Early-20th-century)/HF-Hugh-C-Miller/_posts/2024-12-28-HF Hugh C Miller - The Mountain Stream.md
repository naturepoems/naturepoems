The Mountain Stream  
Through rugged rocks the waters leap,  
With joyous laughter through the deep;  
In nature's heart, where silence reigns,  
The streamlet winds through golden grains.  

It murmurs soft, a lullaby,  
As twilight spreads across the sky;  
With peace it blesses all it meets,  
The flower, the tree, the mossy seats.
