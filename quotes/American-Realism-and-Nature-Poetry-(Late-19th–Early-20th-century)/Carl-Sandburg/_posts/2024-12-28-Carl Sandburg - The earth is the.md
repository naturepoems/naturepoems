The earth is the lord’s
and the fullness thereof,
not only the sun and the stars
but the great dark earth,
the quiet trees,
the swelling hills—
a wilderness that lies before me.

I am at peace,
for within my soul
there is no confusion,
only trees waving
and wind playing,
a place where the mountains
write their lines across the sky.

- Carl Sandburg
