A Field-Mouse
The grass lay low,  
Crouched in little mounds  
Where the field-mouse built a house  
It nestled to lean low of a skull,  
Beginnings worth remembering at night.  
Fingers of grass returned, unbent,  
Like wicker, as over them I lay—  
How gentle safe this cave, as centuries pass  
Where wild earth warmed the stones and let me sleep.

The springtime then, o’er every waving eye;  
It soaked the wind like dandelion leaves  
Deep into all the repose that ever sang;  
Auroras flowing fine like silk-like bright.  
These days with their brushing of her grass-sleeves—  
And bleached the days over with sunshine long,  
All breathe of every waited thought of air,  
To sing to me that I shall care—this hole  
Holds equal bonds against the eye of life!  
To hold her fast; and all wild creatures’ hands  
Shall hold true, granted they know their right!—  
Curling to time, so visit them all light;—
To keep each touch of that gaze’s path o’er fire!  
As by the warmth of over-rolling curl of life  
I—so tranquil—deep as love can dream!
