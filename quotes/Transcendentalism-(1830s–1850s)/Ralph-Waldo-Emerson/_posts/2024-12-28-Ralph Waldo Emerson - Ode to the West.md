Ode to the West Wind

   Spirit of Autumn, take me into your wings;
   Toss my words over the hills and into the tides;
   Let your passionate breathing speak the immortal things,
   And carry my heart among the leaves as it glides.

   In your wild ways I find my peace,
   When the seasons change, finding beauty despite
   Life’s wild chill and merciless lease,
   You wrap me in your sweet, swelling night.

                                               —Ralph Waldo Emerson
