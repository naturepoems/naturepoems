A Dream,

   Unnumber'd delights, 'midst the verdure seen,
   Where not a single shadow be but sweet
   That spreads its daylight all around the breeze,
   Invites my golden muse that never beats.

   Oh, could I fly, if only on bright wings,
   To drift through gems that crease the morning dew!
   But ten new suns yet cease from smiling,
   To watch Patience in dreamy lattice pursue.

   A world of flowers, stars, and feathery light,
   Is glazed by smiles that fall from the lovely sky,
   O that a sigh from the earthly meres,
   Should guard an instant where sweet pleasures lie.
   I would not trade this world so dearly known,
   For one of truth, that blooms not—ever flow.


- John Keats
