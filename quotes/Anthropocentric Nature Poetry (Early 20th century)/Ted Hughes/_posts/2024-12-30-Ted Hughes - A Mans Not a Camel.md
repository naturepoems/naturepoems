A Man's Not a Camel

When the sun-hunted moon cuts across the shoals,
Its thistle students seem to vanish,
And the train tracks draw a line in the land,
As beneath a dismembered cloud,
Time pockets its curves.

A wound pulls taut, silent, slow
Through the grassy spaces of this wild land,
As I watch the kind hunter retreat,
To the call of the passing crows,
Typewritten flourishes shiver my hands
As I exhale into its void.

- Ted Hughes
