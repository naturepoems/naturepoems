What Lips My Lips Have Kissed, and Where, and Why  
  ------------------------------------------------ 
What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,  
I have forgotten, and what arms have lain  
Under my head till morning; but the sky  
Is full of the movement of the leaves, and rain  
Is falling upon the earth, and I am here  
Alone, and yet I feel the touch of time,  
Like faded flowers; and I return again  
To those that I have loved; and standing near  
To kiss their lips again; and yet it seems  
The wind blows cold, and the world is dark  
And I am out of place; and my heart dreams  
Of the falling rain, and the passing lark  
In the lonely sky that I can see,  
The fading light, the time that has flown by.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
