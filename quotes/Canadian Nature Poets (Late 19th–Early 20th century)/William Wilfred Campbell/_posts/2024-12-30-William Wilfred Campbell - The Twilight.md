The Twilight

The twilight air is softly filled,
  With shadows cast from skies,
  Where silence reigns, serene and wild,
  And echoed whispers rise.

Along the stream, where willows weep,
  In a painted calm repose,
  The thoughts of life in silence keep,
  Where every twilight glows.

Oh, the beauty of the hour—
  It holds my heart ensnared,
  As evening weaves her fragrant flower,
  And lights the dreams I’ve shared.

- William Wilfred Campbell
