The sun sets low, a painted sky,
With strokes of red as clouds drift by.
In twilight’s glow, our spirits fly,
An ode to nature, sweet goodbye.

Stars awaken, shining bright,
In endless dark, they spark the night.
In solitude, the heart takes flight,
In nature’s love, we find our light.

- Sigrid Unset
