First Morning

The first morning of spring is staggering  
With hope settling on the tender grass,  
Birdsong flutters like laughter into light,  
Each step a step toward the rich unknown.

The trees stretch their arms wide open,  
As if to grasp the skies’ newly painted,  
Each leaf renewed, breathing in the sun,  
While the earth hums with secrets and dreams.  

Bluebells sway like travelers of the dawn,  
Their perfume unlocking the gates of longing—  
Warmth spreads its velvet across the fields,  
And life crawls forth in electric whispers.  

My heart dances with the morning brush,  
In this fragrant whispering embrace,  
For with every heartbeat, I walk in wonder,  
Breathing with this gentle world reborn—every moment unfurling.

— D.H. Lawrence
