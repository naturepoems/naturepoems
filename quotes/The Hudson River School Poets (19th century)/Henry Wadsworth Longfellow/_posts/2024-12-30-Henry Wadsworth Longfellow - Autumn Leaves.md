A single beam of sunlight falls,  
Upon the autumn's rusted leaves.
All nature pauses, stands enthralled,  
A moment caught, life breathes and grieves.

Upon the brook, the fleeting clouds,  
Shall trace a path of foamy white,
Their whispers float where nature shrouds
Her treasures in the coming night.


- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
