Misty Morning

In the haze of dawn,
The world awakens slowly,
Wrapped in a silken shawl,
Of misty dreams and whispers,
Painting the fields in gray.

Silhouettes of trees,
Stand like guardians,
Against a backdrop of clouds,
Where nature’s breath hovers,
In the stillness of the hour.

Each dewdrop glimmers,
Like a promise renewed,
As life stirs and stretches,
In the embrace of the sun,
Welcoming a day yet to unfold.

- Konstantīns Raudive
