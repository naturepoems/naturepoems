Harvest

The fields are sharing treasures,  
   The fruit of golden grain;  
And voices ring out through the vale,  
   In carols of the plain.  
For here are dreams of time gone by,  
   And days of joy and cheer;  
In harvest fields so rich and wide,  
   The echoes linger near.  

â€“ Laurence Binyon
