Beauty

I
  Beauty, an inward gaze has passed,
     Through nature's eyes; I am transfixed,
     The golden sun so soft embraced
     The verdant earth, through warmth is licked.

II
  The willow bends, the flower sighs,
     While green and golden glances meet,
     Delight within the sunlit skies,
     Mingle in paths where spirits greet.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
