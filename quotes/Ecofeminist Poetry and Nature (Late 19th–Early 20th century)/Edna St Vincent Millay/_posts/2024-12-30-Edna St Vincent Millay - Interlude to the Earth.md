INTERLUDE TO THE EARTH

We birds, we beast; we sun and moon,
   Who travel light and air,
We dance among the golden dew,
   With forms beyond all fear.

When summer breathes amidst the trees,
   And gentle shines appear,
Then whisper to the world thy thoughts,
   As nature’s face approaches near.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
