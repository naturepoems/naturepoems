Rivers weave through rugged lands,  
Mirroring skies in their gentle flow,  
An endless journey in nature’s hands,  
With secrets deep, and tales to show.

The sunlight dances on rippling waves,  
A vibrant path through stone and sand,  
In the heartbeat of time, nature saves,  
Each moment anew, forever planned.


- Yves Tanguy
