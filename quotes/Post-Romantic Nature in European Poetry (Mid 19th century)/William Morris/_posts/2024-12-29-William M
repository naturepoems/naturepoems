I stand in beauty’s gardens where the rose 
Displays its brilliance for the world to see; 
Around me, nature’s harmony bestows, 
The peace of mind and heart, so wild and free.

With every step I take, the petals sway,  
A dance of color, whispered in the air; 
And as the light spills forth in bright array,  
I’m lost, entranced by nature’s grand affair.

Let kindness bloom where shadows used to lie,  
As spring prepares to paint the world in glee; 
So here I breathe, beneath the glorious sky,  
And find forever love in nature’s plea.


- William Morris
