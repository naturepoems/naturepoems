The mountains rise like ancient arms,
Reaching toward the blazing sun,
Rock and metal, pulse of hearts,
We merge our destinies with the winds.

Each valley roars with past victories,
Where echo meets the scream of machines,
Dance beneath their wild shadows,
Together, we etch our names across time.

Let us conquer this realm,
Harnessing life, raw and electric,
For even in nature’s wild evening,
We spur the future’s orchestrated dreams!

- FT Marinetti
