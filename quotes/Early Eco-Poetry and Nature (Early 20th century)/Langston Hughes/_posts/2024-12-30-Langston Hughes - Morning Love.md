Morning Love

In the quietude of dawn,
When the world is still asleep,
Golden rays caress the earth,
In a tender, warm embrace.

The flowers bloom in colors bright,
As the birds begin to sing,
Their melodious symphony
Welcoming the day’s new fling.

With each heartbeat in the air,
Nature’s pulse awakens me,
And I find my soul at peace
In morning’s gentle decree.

- Langston Hughes
