The mountains rise against the horizon,
Majestic, powerful, and still,
Their peaks kissed by clouds,
Whispers of snow in the sunlight.

I walk among the pines,
Their scent clings to my skin,
Every step a connection,
To the heartbeat of the earth.

Here in this solitude,
I find a piece of myself,
A reflection in the quiet,
Nature cradles me close,
In its timeless embrace.

- Richard Wright
