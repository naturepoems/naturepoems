---

The years are cancerous, the years are cruel,
And in the likeness of the world I see
Whate’er is beautiful there’s death, and all
Shall come to naught in this eternity.

Yet, in the shadow of the greenest grove,
Deep in the hush of cypress melancholy,
I know a moment’s magic from the veil
Of dreams awake from thoughts of memories.


- Elizabeth Siddal
