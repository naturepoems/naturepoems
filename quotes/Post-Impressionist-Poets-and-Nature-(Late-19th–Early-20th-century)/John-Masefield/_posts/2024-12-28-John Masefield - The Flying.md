The Flying Fish

In the dusk of the morn I saw it fly,
Come out from the spray, like a star in the sky!
The sun turned right and round and round,
The wind blew gently, and the waves laughed loud.
So let the fish fly, let the dreams swarm,
For the sea is ours while the land is warm.

- John Masefield
