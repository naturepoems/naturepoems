But when the world is quiet, child,
Let all the leaves proclaim it, child;
Lay yourself with your solemn thoughts,
And ponder still the twisting ways,
As when the bright hand of the night
And then—It swells and shrinks with knots.

Let the world deplore, child,
And grow up eager as a stream,
Let the stars align in heavenly stills,
And let your mind forsake the sleeping dreams,
Stand with your heart before the world,
And all our days are what they seem.

- Robert Frost
