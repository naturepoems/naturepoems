Ah, come, thou gentle rain!  
And herald in the Spring,  
With whispers soft as silken lace,  
And every songbird’s wing.

Let blossoms bathe and old trees sigh,  
As buds begin to swell;  
Creating soft and leafy joy  
That all the world can tell.

Soft sinks the day, and shadows grow,  
Exploding pure delight;  
From every nook and cranny low,  
Nature's wonders rise with might.

O rain! in joy we welcome thee,  
That steals the starry green,  
No beauty in this world could be,  
Without your gentle sheen.
