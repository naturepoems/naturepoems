The artist's heart is always in the chaos
of the destructiveness of a city
yet he always leans to the seasons
that create and pull and walk away
from the full noise;
where the grass grows through
snaps of steel,
that seem to bend toward beauty.

Among all my gods, you are the one
most splendid, with a silver strength
that changes all that I knew.

You live in trees, birds, stones;
I chase you.
What brave chaos!

- Muriel Rukeyser
