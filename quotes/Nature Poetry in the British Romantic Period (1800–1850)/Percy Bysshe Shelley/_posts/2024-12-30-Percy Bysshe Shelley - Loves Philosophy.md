Love's Philosophy

The fountains mingle with the river
And the river with the ocean;
The winds of heaven mix forever
With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single;
All things by a law divine
In one another's being mingle—
Why not I with thine?  

See the mountains kiss high heaven
And the waves clasp one another;
No sister-flower would be forgiven
If it disdain'd its brother;
And the sunlight clasps the earth
And the moonbeams kiss the sea:
What are all these kissings worth,
If thou kiss not me?  

— Percy Bysshe Shelley
