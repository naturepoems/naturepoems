---

I cannot forget the blue of the sky—
Was it a cloud or wind, can’t remember,
The strands of moss that drooped
Upon wet stone in the forest!
The ferns were deep, they whispered
As if sharing tales old as time, 
Yet soft as land.
Let me lie beyond the ground,
Where the sky clings close, and the air pulses,
In the valley of mist.
For there my spirit rested, and lingered, 
Among nature’s own soul.

All else falls away, I come and go,
Through shadow and mist, no ache, just murmuring wind.
