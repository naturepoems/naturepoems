Nature

Oh, nature, with her golden gaze,  
Fills my heart with a sweet, trembling blaze;  
The wind whispers stories to the trees,  
And the dew drops glisten like pearls of ease.

The mountains soar, the rivers flow,  
In their embrace we forget our woe;  
Each flower blooms, each bird does sing,  
In the lush arms of this eternal spring.

To wander these paths, hand in hand with fate,  
In the depths of silence, we meditate;  
For life is fleeting, a momentary spark,  
Yet blossoms eternally in natureâ€™s dark.

- Charles Baudelaire
