The brook flows softly through the glade,
Its waters dance, its beauty laid;
Among the rocks, it twists and turns,
While nature’s heart within it burns.

Each ripple sings a melody,
A secret song for you and me.
It winds through trees, where shadows play,
And brings to life the dawn of day.

The gentle hum of life around,
Creates a world of sacred sound;
Where nature’s heart beats pure and free,
In every stream, in you, in me.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
