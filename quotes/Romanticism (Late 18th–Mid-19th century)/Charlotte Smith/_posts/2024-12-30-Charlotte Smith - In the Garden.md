In gardens rich with shadows, where dreams weave,  
I stroll beneath the fragrant, leafy hues;  
The scents of jasmine linger, and believe—  
Each bloom holds stories whispered in the blues.  

Let nature's wealth enwrap me like a shroud,  
With every step, I leave behind the noise;  
In silence found, I breathe the peace unclouded,  
And in my heart, the echo of her joys.

- Charlotte Smith
