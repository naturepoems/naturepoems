In spring’s embrace,
the earth awakens,
with every bud breaking the silence,
a joyous birth of promised brightness,
a bashful kiss of life.

Here dance the bees,
a mini symphony of buzzes,
while colors blossom,
painting paths with joys,
in a vibrant crescendo,
that sings the year’s rebirth,
the fleeting joy of existence.

From the petals’ perfume,
i drink the essence of time,
as nature sings the sonnet
of growth redolent with love,
reminding me gently of heartbeats
haunting every silence.

- Juan Ramón Jiménez
