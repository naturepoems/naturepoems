I can see you in the shadow
Of the trees along the road.
I can feel your presence near me,
Even when you’re far away.

In the meadow where the flowers
Bloom in riotous array,
You are whispering in the wind,
In every rustle of the hay.

Listen, listen to the silence;
Follow it as it flies,
For in nature’s golden moments
You will hear the echoed sighs.

- Robert Frost
