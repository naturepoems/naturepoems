Waves crash against the shore,  
a timeless rhythmic dance,  
the ocean's embrace,  
a song of the deep.  
Seagulls cry,  
a call to the wild,  
while the salty breeze  
tug at the soul,  
binding us to its pulse.  

With each ebb and flow,  
a reminder of life's cycles,  
a journey that transcends,  
where the land meets the sea,  
a sacred union.

- Gino Bartali
