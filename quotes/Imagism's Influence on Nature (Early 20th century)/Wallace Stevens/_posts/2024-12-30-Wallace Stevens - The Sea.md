The Sea

The sea is calm tonight
The tide is ebbing, thin as a whisper,
And then the waves begin to rise,
As though to catch the echoes of the pastâ€”

What winds had blown through your crystal tides,
In balance, in belief.
Breathe in the salts of the waves,
And hear the long tales of closure.


- Wallace Stevens
