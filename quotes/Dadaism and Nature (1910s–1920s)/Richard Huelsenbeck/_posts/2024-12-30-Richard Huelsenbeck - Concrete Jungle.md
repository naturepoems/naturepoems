Concrete Jungle

O bright iron flowers
Thrusting skyward in disguise,
Cacophony and concrete,
Beauty that may blind the eyes.

In the heart of the clamor,
Nature's footfalls retreat,
While the asphalt whispers,
Of loss love entreats.

Yet in the cracks of the pavement,
A seed finds a way,
A brave emerald sprout,
Shouting, “I shall stay!”


- Richard Huelsenbeck
