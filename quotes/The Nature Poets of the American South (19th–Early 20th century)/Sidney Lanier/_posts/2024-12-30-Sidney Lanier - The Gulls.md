The Gulls
High, high above the slipping swell,
  The dancing clouds lie bright and free;
The seagulls cry, their songs that swell,
  In joyful, echoing harmony.

O, wild and startled on the winds,
  Their souls like silver dart and wheel;
They keep the secrets of the tides,
  Their laughter mingles sea with zeal.

- Sidney Lanier
