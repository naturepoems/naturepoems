The Emperor of Ice-Cream

Let be be finale of seem.
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.

Call the roller of big cigars,
The muscular one, and bid him whip
In kitchen cups concupiscent curds.

Let be be finale of seem.
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.

Take from the dresser of deal,
Lacking the three glass knobs, that sheet
On which she embroidered in the moonlight.

Let be be finale of seem. 
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.

- Wallace Stevens
