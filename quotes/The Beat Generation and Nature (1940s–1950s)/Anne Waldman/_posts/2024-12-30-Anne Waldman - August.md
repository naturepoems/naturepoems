August
when August enters
cradled in the curve of the moon,
the trees sigh, brown spots on their leaves,
fingers reach toward the sunlight,
remembering the dance of summer leaps,
a firefly’s flickering closed.

there's a smell of grass crisping,
waiting for the rains to stir,
waiting for autumn's whisper,
the golden light that comes,
a hushed goodbye beneath
heavy branches,
yearning for the sky,
yearning for the careless years.

Anne Waldman
