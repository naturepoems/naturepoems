A Bird came down the Walk—
He did not know I saw—
He bit an Angleworm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw.

And then he drank a Dew
From a convenient Grass—
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall
To let a Beetle pass—

He glanced with rapid Eyes
That hurried all around—
They looked like frightened Beads, I took
To be in danger bound—

I offered him a Crumb,
And he unrolled his feathers
And rowed him softer home—
Than Oars divide the Ocean—

Too silver for a seam—
Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon
Leap, plashless as they swim—

- Emily Dickinson
