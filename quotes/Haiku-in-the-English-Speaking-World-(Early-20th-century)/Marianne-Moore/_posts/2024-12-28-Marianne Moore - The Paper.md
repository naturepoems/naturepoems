The Paper Nautilus
   It was a surprise,
   a creature, carved from
   a frond of moonlight and
   fast currents, it elegantly,
   unhesitatingly tells
tales of untrammeled seas;
   its shining kraken mysteries
   wrap on the knotted, dull shells
   of what wasâ€”that caught
   our gaze, drifting high,
   above the ocean[,] curious.

- Marianne Moore
