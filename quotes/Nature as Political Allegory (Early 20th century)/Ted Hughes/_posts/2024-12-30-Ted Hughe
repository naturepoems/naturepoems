Nature’s Play

I
At dawn, the forest breathes,
a quickening pulse
of reverie, a dance within dreams,
a splash of color unceasing.

II
Here moments echo,
a fingertip tracing paths,
in rhythms of ebb and flow,
wonders whispering softly.

III
Each creature engages,
its essence hanging in the balance,
an embrace of instincts that rise,
a bold exploration expanding.

IV
This play within nature,
a tumble of sounds and scenes;
a legacy glimmers in view,
holding time in a delicate cradle.

- Ted Hughes
