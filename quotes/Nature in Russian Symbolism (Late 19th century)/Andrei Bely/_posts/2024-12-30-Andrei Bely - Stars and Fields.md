Above the world, the stars gleam bright, 
In fields of silver, the deer take flight.
The river dances under the light, 
Natureâ€™s voice sings through the night.

The whispering pines, the still of the air, 
The heart feels the pulse of life everywhere.
Each blade of grass, each flower fair, 
Observes the beauty, the world laid bare.

In dreams of twilight, in dawn's embrace, 
Nature unfolds its tender grace.
Oh to wander, to find my place, 
Among the wonders, time cannot erase.

- Andrei Bely
