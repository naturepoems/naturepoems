The Coming of Spring

Out of the cold, and the dark, and the gloom,
The herald of spring brings a melody sweet,
With promise of life as flowers will bloom,
In each gentle breeze, our heart finds its beat.

The sweet of the rustling leaves in the air,
Calls forth the blossoms to dance under sun,
As warmth melts the winter’s cold, soft despair,
And smiles as we welcome the season begun.

O joyous spring, with the songs of delight,
The heart fears not shadows, for dreams take their flight;
In the bower of life that you tenderly weave,
Our spirits shall bright in the blooms we believe.

—Felicia Hemans
