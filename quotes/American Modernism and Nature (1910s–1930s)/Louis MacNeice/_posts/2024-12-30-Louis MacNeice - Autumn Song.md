Autumn Song 

The trees like fragrant giants,  
Flowing sweeps of gold and violet,  
Dance in the bright flight of wind  
Duplicitous, as in the turning of air  
Where leaves take up their whispers  
And the blood of sunset gathers pale,  
As the light winds through this hush,  
Later, deeper grace.  

In this eve, hear the birds;  
Listen to the delicate creak of now  
Twisting as the branches sway;  
Mingling magic where shadows set  
Their fate among souls yearning  
For silent green again.  

Time bends, drawing out its truth,  
As I fold each page into the night,  
With words as soft as whispered breath —  
Returning into quietness,  
For leaf, for dream — love must be  
The bright hour heard above.

- Louis MacNeice
