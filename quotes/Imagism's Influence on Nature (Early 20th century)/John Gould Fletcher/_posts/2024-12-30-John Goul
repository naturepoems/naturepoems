Clouds

In the evening the clouds rise,  
a soft whisper of smoke  
in rhythm not known, drowned —  
tales drenched in twilight glow,  
draped in soft gauze;  
the silence blooms slow,  
a motion unfurls in deep —  
a shimmer alive, light fading  
wrapped near a grey heart.  
Each shadow pushes near;  
it carries every whisper,  
though time will waste on wind  
holding memory deep —  
an echo wild of the world  
as night enters free.

- John Gould Fletcher
