The Sea

Ethereal and voice, along the shore,
where air grows the depth of voices; it stirs
in physical whispers, curling upon rocks,
it renders motion vast, carrying dust.
What currents sing; surf at the feet,
a promise lives on air and touch—
all claim to bold reflect, something lost
and shimmering! So the sea breeds light,
oreflecting forms, a tide that gives,
yet calls those daughters with meaning:
a trust in colors meeting dark age,
resonant like a soft hush lost,
a balance finding silence, out of hours,
bounds upon the wild, in soft embrace toward dares, 
yet once gripping hand, and so forth—
to hold each word, from journey’s soul.


- Marianne Moore
