The Plain Sense of Things

The plain sense of things
Is what is real in nature.
Is the touch upon the farthest leaf,
Is the gust of wind against the trees,
The tick of the hour close when time recedes.

Beauty travels beyond its folds,
And every sound gives meaning; 
Consciousness is but a resting place,
For wisdom held within the patterned ground.

Life watches all and is beyond itself,
In nature's threshold, plain and simple,
The heart finds its way back home,
To every frame of existence laid bare. 

And the senses drum along the path,
Leading to places not yet known,
Where mystery mingles with clarity,
In the tranquil groves of nature's rhyme.


- Wallace Stevens
