I May I Writ

Am I too pale?
Skimp through the depths of the dark,
For white snow blooms made crabbed,
Flying over early breaks—

There the cycles round make circles;
Yet inward still death's low and long,
Dragged below their heaved grasses,
Sustaining nothing yet each moment.

A few brazen noises remind;  
A stomach aching past forms.
Through which even in autumn,
I serve to be kissed by noon.


- Marianne Moore
