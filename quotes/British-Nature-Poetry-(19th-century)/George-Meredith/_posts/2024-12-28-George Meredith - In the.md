In the Woods

    In the woods where sunlight weaves,
    And shadows dance around,
    The pulse of life the heart receives,
    In every shade and sound.

    The rustling leaves, a gentle hymn,
    The brook a song of peace,
    In nature's care, our spirits brim,
    And all our sorrows cease.

    So come, O friend, where beauty reigns,
    And love enkindles day;
    For in these woods, our hearts shall gain,
    A joy that will not stray.

- George Meredith
