Snow

The snow lies deep upon the earth,
A silence stretches vast and wide,
Each flake a gentle whispered birth,
As nature dons a purest hide.

In frost that wraps the limbs and boughs,
With breath of winter cold and still,
A landscape dances, bows and vows,
The world is hushed; it knows not shrill.

The darkened skies, they breathe a thought,
In twilight's grace, no shadows yield,
This magic held, a moment sought,
Where every path must be revealed.

And in this crystal cloak we find,
The beauty that the storm upholds,
An echo of an art designed,
Within the stillness, life unfold.

- Edward Thomas
