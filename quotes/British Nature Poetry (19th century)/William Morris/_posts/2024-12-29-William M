The Evening Star

After the sunset on the hill,
The world has turned in timeless peace,
And the twilight deepens over still,
As the calls of rest begin to cease.

Beneath my silent, starry watch,
With gentle hum of the night above,
Each shadow dances in the notch,
As I remember the glow of love.


- William Morris
