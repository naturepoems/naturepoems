A Dream of Trees

When I am in the dark night,  
when I wake into the world,  
there come some trees,  
gently bending,  
under the weight of  
all that has happenedâ€”  
triumph and sorrow,  
welcomes and regrets.  
At times I glimpse up  
at their quiet green hands,  
and I think of how they are alive  
in the dark as I am,  
gently and profoundly.  
Through them I feel  
the life that shines,  
delicate as a smile,  
and love is waiting.

- Mary Oliver
