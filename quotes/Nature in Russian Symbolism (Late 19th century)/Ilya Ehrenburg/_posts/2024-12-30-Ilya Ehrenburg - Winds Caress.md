Wind's Caress
The wind, a ghostly presence near,
Whispers softly through the trees;
With every gust, it chases fear,
A soothing balm on bended knees.

It carries scents of earth and sky,
Of blooming fields and oceans vast;
In its embrace, the heart will fly,
And revel in the spell it casts.

- Ilya Ehrenburg
