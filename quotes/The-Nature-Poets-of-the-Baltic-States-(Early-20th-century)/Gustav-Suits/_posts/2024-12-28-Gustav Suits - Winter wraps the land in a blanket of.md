Winter wraps the land in a blanket of white,
every tree stands adorned, a pure frozen sight.
The hush in the woods, so silent, so bright,
appears as though nature contemplates the night.

Each flake tells a story, descending from high,
while moonglow brushes the trees as they sigh.
In the chill of the air, still magic persists,
and the spirit of winter in quietness exists.
