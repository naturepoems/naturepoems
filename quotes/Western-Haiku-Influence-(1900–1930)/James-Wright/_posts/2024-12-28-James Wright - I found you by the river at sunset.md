quote: "I found you by the river at sunset, 
With the catkins swirling in the air, 
Spring called us softly, like a backlit thought, 
We leaned against the willow tree, lost, 
Only the ripples touching the shore knew our secrets."

I found you by the river at sunset, 
With the catkins swirling in the air, 
Spring called us softly, like a backlit thought, 
We leaned against the willow tree, lost, 
Only the ripples touching the shore knew our secrets.
