Above, the sky whispers
with clouds painted in pastels,
a canvas ever-changing,
a reminder of impermanence.

Birds trace the arcs,
a ballet of flight,
their songs a celebration
of the dayâ€™s new promise.

In the softness of twilight,
the world exhales,
alighting the horizon
with hues of lavender and gold.

- Alejandra Zambra
