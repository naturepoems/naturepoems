As the twilight gently falls,  
And the stars awaken in the night,
The crickets hum, a melody calls  
An echo of the heart’s delight.

In nature’s arms, the weary fade,  
To dream upon the whispered breeze,
Where every step and every shade,  
Shall lead the heart upon its ease.


- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
