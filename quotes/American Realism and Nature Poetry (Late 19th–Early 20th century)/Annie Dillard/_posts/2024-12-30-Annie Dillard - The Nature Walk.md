In a world of reckless haste,
I find my solace in the slow.
Each petal, a thought.
Each breeze, a shared secret,
A deep breath as the day ages.
Let us wander out where
Light plays soft against
The sturdy trunks of oaks,
Settled in their wisdom,
Assured in their presence.

             – From "The Nature Walk"

- Annie Dillard
