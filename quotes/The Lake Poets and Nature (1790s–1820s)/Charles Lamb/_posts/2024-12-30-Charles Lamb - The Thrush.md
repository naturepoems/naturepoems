The Thrush

A thrush calls sweetly from the bough,
With melody on lighted wing,
He weaves a serenade, a vow,
His song is Nature’s joyful spring.

From leafy branches, clear and bright,
He pours a rapture on the air,
Awakening the world to light,
His love's song drowns all care.

O bird, your heart is full of mirth,
In every note your soul takes flight,
A glimpse of Heaven found on Earth,
In every dawn, your pure delight.

- Charles Lamb
