The Harvest Moon

When the autumn moon is high,
Gathering light to fill the sky,
Fields of laughter yell in gold,
The stories of the harvest told.

Gathered round without a care,
All the joys of life we share;
By the light that nature spills,
We sing the songs of rolling hills.

- John Charles McNeill
