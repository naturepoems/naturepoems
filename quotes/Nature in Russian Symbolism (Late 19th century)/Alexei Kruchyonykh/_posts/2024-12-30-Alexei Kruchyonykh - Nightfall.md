Nightfall
As daylight fades into the velvet dusk,
Nature's shadows stretch, a reassuring husk.
Stars begin to twinkle, like diamonds in lace,
In the cradle of night, we find our place.

The chirping of crickets fills the air,
A symphony woven with love and care.
In the hush of the evening, our hearts take flight,
Embracing all wonders that come with the night.

- Alexei Kruchyonykh
