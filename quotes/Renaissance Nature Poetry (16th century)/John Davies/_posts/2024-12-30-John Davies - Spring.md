Spring

When earth awakens, fresh and pure,  
The world is woven in the light;  
The flowers burst from slumber’s lure,  
And greet the day with sheer delight.

Where rivers run with laughter’s flow,  
And gentle breezes brush the trees,  
In springtime’s arms, the heart shall grow,  
As daylight dances with the bees.

O spring, thou breath of life, so sweet,  
To you my heart now takes its flight;  
For nature's voice, in whispers fleet,  
Doth sing of love both pure and bright.

- John Davies
