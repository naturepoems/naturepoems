The petals’ perfumed thrones,
The tranquility of absence echoes,
In silence, the soft sigh of sun.
And there, amidst the softening light,
The day slowly comes to unbound rest."

When the honeybees buzz from
The petals’ perfumed thrones,
The tranquility of absence echoes,
In silence, the soft sigh of sun.
And there, amidst the softening light,
The day slowly comes to unbound rest.

- Marianne Moore
