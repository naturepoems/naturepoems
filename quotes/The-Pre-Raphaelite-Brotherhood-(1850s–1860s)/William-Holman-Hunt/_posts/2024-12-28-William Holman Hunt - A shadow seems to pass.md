A shadow seems to pass,  
To darkness in the trees, 
For all my cloistered centuries.  
Shy whispers haunt the woodlands
Echo softly a lover's plea.  
And yet, amid the trees we stand  
Sweet sounds, teem with the ancient glee,  
An elfin band chases a ringed moon;  
At flute's end with the harp's display,  
The splendor of your light, 
And all the forest's green shall sway,  
Hold you in this trance.  
Gold threads in the loom of day.  


- William Holman Hunt
