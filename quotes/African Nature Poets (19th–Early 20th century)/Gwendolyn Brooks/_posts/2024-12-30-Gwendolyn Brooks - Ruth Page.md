Ruth Page

In the green morning light
Where the trees beckon and sway
You find, as you cross the earth,
A kindness larger than yourself.

Birds sing to the edges of your mind,
Where scent is ripest and purest,
Pushing away the earth, until you soil your wings
In a mystique—all is turned to dance.

- Gwendolyn Brooks
