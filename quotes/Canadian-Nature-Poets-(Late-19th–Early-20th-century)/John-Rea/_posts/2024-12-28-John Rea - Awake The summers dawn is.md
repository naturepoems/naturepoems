Awake! The summer's dawn is here,
With colors bright and scents divine,
Each flower's bloom, so pure and clear,
A tapestry of life, we find.

The whispering grass beneath our feet,
The warmth of sun on skin and soul,
In nature’s arms, our hearts complete,
As life unfolds, we feel it whole.

- John Rea
