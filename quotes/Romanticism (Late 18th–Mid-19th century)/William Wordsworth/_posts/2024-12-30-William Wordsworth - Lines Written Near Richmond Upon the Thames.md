Lines Written Near Richmond, Upon the Thames
With a pointed and deliberate flare  
silence so vast fills the soul,  
Yet life is bound to overflow —  
with every leaf, with every flow,  
with rivers, sun, and gentle air —  
We must embrace this love, I'm sure.  

Each blossom knows that it may fade,
Wild fragrant ease remains to stay,  
For Nature does naught wrong, nor shame,
But basks within the light, our aim.  

So sweet, so wondrous, by this way,  
Where every current shall adhere,  
Through warm embrace we drift from care,
Awash in Nature, wide and clear.  

The future mingles like the light,
A dance of scattered leaves takes flight,  
Such vibrant joy spills forth to share,
In every glance within the air.  

That even when the day is done,  
And darkness cools the shimmering glow,  
A heartbeat's echo might be spun —  
Feeling life's onrush like a flowing row.

- William Wordsworth
