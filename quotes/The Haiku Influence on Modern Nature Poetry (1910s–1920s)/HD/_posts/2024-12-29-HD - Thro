---

Through shade and shape among the missing—
Horizon glimmers open its heart,
With hints of stillness, unfolding dusk;
Presence of swallows resting in wire,
Birds surrendering folded wings,
While shadows dance and sway gently,
In this dark’s born expanse.
Will they fly through to the mountains,
In their flight like ink on a canvas?
I long to witness what is theirs to touch,
Their song a quiet need; let me hold,
The breath of flowers just waiting to unfold.
