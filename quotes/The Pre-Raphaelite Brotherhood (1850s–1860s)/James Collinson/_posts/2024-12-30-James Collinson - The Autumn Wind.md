The Autumn Wind


  The wind through the everglade,  
  How ade your sweaters or cheeks!  
  For why us away, like saddest noise,  
  To careless along the wheats?  
  I smiles as it roams in his folds,  
  And combs in gusto the bands —  
  Until all together — this frozen mud  
  Goes quietly from its hands.
