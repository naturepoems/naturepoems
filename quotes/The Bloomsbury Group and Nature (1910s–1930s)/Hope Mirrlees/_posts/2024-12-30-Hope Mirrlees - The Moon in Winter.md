THE MOON IN WINTER

Where the still woods wait in the frozen dark,
And the stars are shaken from icy fingers,
The moon hangs low, a luminous spark,
A lantern for dreams where the shiver lingers.

Amidst the thick branches, it bathes the ground,
In shimmering light that the frost seems to weave,
A silver thread through the silence profound,
A comfort, a promise, on this eve of leave.

Through wisps of the clouds like soft floating flakes,
It glides like a ghost in the cold air laid bare,
In this quiet embrace, the last heart breaks,
Before morning’s chrysalis, soft as despair.


- Hope Mirrlees
