Invitation to the Voyage

My child, my sister, think of the sweetness,
And of the tranquility, of the horizon blue,
Where all is harmony, and all souls shall meet
Beside the roaring waves that sing tenderly too.

The universe winks, where the scent beckons,
Of flowers and love beneath the balm of the moon;
We glide, as unicorns on feathered wings,
In avenues of gold, whirring with the tune.

The sky will melt into twilightâ€™s embrace,
Filling our sight, the horizon chaste,
That glimmers, blooms, where our hearts find solace,
And gives in each moment, eternal grace.


- Charles Baudelaire
