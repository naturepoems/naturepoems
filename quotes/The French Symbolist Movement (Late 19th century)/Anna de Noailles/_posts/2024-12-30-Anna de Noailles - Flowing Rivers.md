The flow of rivers speaks to restless souls,
Winding paths intersecting dreams and fate;
A melody of water, earth, and air,
Time cradled in nature's gentle embrace.

Each ripple a whisper, soft and profound,
Carving the landscape with tender strokes;
In rhythm with lifeâ€™s eternal flow,
Nature reveals the beauty of being alive.

- Anna de Noailles
