Invitation to the Voyage

My child, my sister,  
Think how sweet it would be  
To wander there together  
In the heart of a warm and beautiful land!  
Adorned with the things I love,  
Let us sail away, let us sail away!

There is no need to hurry,  
With the air so filled with perfumes,  
And the night so cool and pleasant,  
It is to your soul that I will open  
The treasures and wonders of nature.


- Charles Baudelaire
