Tree of Life

The tree spills over
the edges of memory,
boundless branches reach,
intertwining with the sky,
a tapestry of life,

where each leaf,
each whisper of wind,
holds a secret,
a fragment of existence
waiting to be forged
to clay and spirit.

Under this cathedral
of green,
I lay down,
feeling the pulse of the earth,
the rhythm of my heart,
matching the slow dance
of the universe.

Each shadow,
could be a dream,
each light flicker,
a mirage of hope,
a reminder of those
that walked before,

of all life lived,
and those yet to move,
who will find solace
in this ancient embrace.


- Diane di Prima
