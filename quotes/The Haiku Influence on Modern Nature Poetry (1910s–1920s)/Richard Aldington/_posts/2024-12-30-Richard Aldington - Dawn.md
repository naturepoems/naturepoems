As the dawn breaks bright and clear,
Light spills over the waking world,
And the dew rests faintly on the blades,
Each drop a jewel caught in the grass.

The fragrance of new beginnings fills the air,
While birds call their fervent tunes,
In harmony with the pulse of life,
And I am but a humble witness,
To nature’s grand awakening.

- Richard Aldington
