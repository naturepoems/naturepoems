In the evening light,
The soft glow of dusk,
The flowers whisper secrets,
Each petal a soft breath,
Swaying in the gentle wind.

I kneel in the cool grass,
A world bathed in gold,
Colors mingle and dance,
Violet, red, and blue,
A painter’s palette alive.

The scent is sweet, intoxicating,
Nature’s perfume, delicate,
As I close my eyes and breathe,
I can feel the bloom of the moment,
A quiet celebration of beauty.

- Richard Wright
