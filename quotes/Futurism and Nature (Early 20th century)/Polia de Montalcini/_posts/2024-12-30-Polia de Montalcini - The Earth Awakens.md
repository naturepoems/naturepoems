The Earth Awakens

In the pale light of dawn,
the earth stretches and yawns,
its skin kissed by the sunâ€™s gentle rays.
A symphony of colors,
a palette of greens and golds,
whispers through the leaves,
dancing with the breeze.

Beneath the surface,
the roots entwine,
seeking sustenance,
in a world rich with promise.
Birdsong breaks the silence,
a melody woven from wonder,
as life stirs, shifts, and grows.

Here, hidden miracles unfold,
in every shadow, every glint,
a testament to resilience,
to the vitality of existence.
Let us celebrate the awakening,
this vibrant reawakening of all that is alive.

- Polia de Montalcini
