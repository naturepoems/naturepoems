In the morning, dew clings to grass,
Tiny worlds captured, glistening,
Like jewels scattered by the dawn,
Reflecting every ray of light.

The air is fresh, filled with quiet,
Birds begin to stir and chatter,
The earth awakening from dreams,
As the sun stretches in the sky.

This is where I find my solace,
Among the wild flowers and whispers,
I breathe the promise of the day,
And let the warmth seep within me.

Every moment becomes a treasure,
A heartbeat shared with nature’s grace,
Reminding me of my small place
In the woven fabric of everything.


- Margaret Atwood
