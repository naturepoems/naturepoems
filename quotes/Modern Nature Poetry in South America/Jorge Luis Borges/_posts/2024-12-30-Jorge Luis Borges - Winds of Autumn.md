Winds of Autumn

The wind carries secrets,
Whispers of approaching cold,
A truth of autumn,
The twilight of all things.

Leaves turn golden,
Each curling edge an elegy,
Swaying like dancers,
To a tune only nature knows.

In the quiet, I listen,
As the wind shares her stories,
Reminding me gently,
Of earthâ€™s cycles, of change.


- Jorge Luis Borges
