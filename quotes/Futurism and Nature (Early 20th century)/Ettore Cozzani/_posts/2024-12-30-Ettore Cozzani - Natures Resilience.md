Amidst the chaos of man,
Where steel collides with stone,
Nature remains unbroken,
An anchor in the tempest.

Mountains loom as guardians,
Majestic, silent, wise,
While valleys cradle secrets,
Of times that breathe in quiet lore.

Here, the cycle spins eternal,
A reminder of resilience,
A testimony of endurance,
As seasons come and go,
In a dance of shadow and light.

I long for these moments,
Away from the hustle and greed,
To walk on the trails of memory,
Where wildflowers bloom with abandon,
And everything is as it should be.

- Ettore Cozzani
