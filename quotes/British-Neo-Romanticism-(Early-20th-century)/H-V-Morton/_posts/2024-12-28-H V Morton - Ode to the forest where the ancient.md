Ode to the forest, where the ancient trees sway,
In the stillness of whispers, where the shadows play.
Each trunk a great story, each branch a soft sigh,
In the cradle of green, let your spirit fly high.

A carpet of moss beneath our wandering feet,
In the silence of echoes, the heart finds its beat.
The chorus of crickets as daylight departs,
In nature's sweet kingdom, discover your heart.

The magic of twilight, where the stars weave their light,
In the tapestry woven, the cosmos takes flight.
With the moon offering kisses to the petals below,
In the embrace of the night, let your dreams gently flow.

Within the great stillness, hear nature's soft breath,
In the tranquil of woods, thereâ€™s a solace from death.
For the cycle of life in its purest design,
Leads us back to the heart where the sun always shines.

- H V Morton
