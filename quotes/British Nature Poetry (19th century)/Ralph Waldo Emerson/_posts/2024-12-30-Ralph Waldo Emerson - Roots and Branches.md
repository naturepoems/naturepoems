Within the heart of every tree,
Lies sacred space, potential free;
To reach for heights, to grasp the sun,
In nature’s arms, we are all one.

The roots that plunge in earth’s embrace,
Anchor dreams in time and space;
As branches stretch and leaves unfold,
The story of our lives is told.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
