I measured out my life  
In evening sunsets  
And morning glories  
Sprinkled with gentle rains.  

Life shines most brightly  
In nature’s healing light  
In the glimmering blues,  
In the golden hours of infinite depth.  

The murmuring rivers  
Whisper enchanting stories  
Of a heart’s longing  
For boundless beauty.  

When stars emerge,  
And night enfolds,  
I count my joys  
In the stillness of the dome of the sky.  

Each petal and drop of dew  
Reflects the splendor  
Of life’s art,  
In tranquil balance,  
Where the soul rests.  

With every breath, I find  
Nature’s timeless embrace,  
And the symphony of creation  
Plays sweetly on.  

"I measured out my life"

- Emily Dickinson
