The Cherry Trees
Under their white and fragrant bunches,
The very air stands still, it pauses,
Transfixed by this enchanting breath,
Drawing life so near, yet so, it causes.

In shades of petals, dreams unfold,
Each tree a story tenderly told,
As nature’s diary blooms and bends,
Where every page feels memory’s end.

- Edward Thomas
