To Those Born Later

Truly, I live in dark times!

But in the darkest hour,
there will be a light
for those who have suffered
for those who mourn.
Let us never forget,
because they forgot us.

Yes, we’ll remember,
remember the sun,
with a softer light,
for there will come a time
when we will speak of the heavens,
our feet shall tread on the gleaming earth.

The stars will twinkle above,
whoever takes a step,
whoever takes a breath
shall carry a message,
our lives entwined,
as we embrace the tender fields,
rejoice in the treasures of life.

- Bertolt Brecht
