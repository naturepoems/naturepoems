O greenwood, deep and cool,
Where the elms in majesty tower,
And the wind-stirred green leaves woo,
In thy bower shelter me, a flower.

Bathe me in thy dews, O sweet,
This life of thine that I’d live and know,
When the sunfire blooms and beamles fleet—
Beneath thy shade I long to grow.

- George Edward Woodberry
