Spring's Revival

When the earth wakes gently,
From winter's cold embrace,
The colors burst forth boldly,
In a magnificent showcase.

Blossoms stretch towards sunlight,
Filling the air with sweet scents,
Each petal a symbol of renewal,
In nature's grand events.

Oh, spring, a dance of life,
A celebration from above,
In every single blossom,
Resides the essence of love.

- Ossie Mthembu
