The fields lie in slumber,
   So tranquil and still,
With the dreams of the harvest
   And the soft, gentle thrill.

Let me walk through the golden
   While the sun slowly sets,
For the beauty of nature
   With each moment begets.

In the heart of the landscape,
   I breathe deep and sigh,
For the essence of beauty
   Wears a sweet lullaby.

- James Fenimore Cooper
