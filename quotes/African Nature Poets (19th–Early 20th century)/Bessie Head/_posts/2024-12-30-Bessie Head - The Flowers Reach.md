THE FLOWER'S REACH  
In a world so vast and open,  
Every flower stretches toward its sun,  
Reaching out for the warmth.  
Finding the light  
In a few precious hours.  

Yet, beneath the surface,  
Their roots entwine,  
Sharing strength,  
A community of life,  
Waiting for the rains.  

Can we learn from the flower?  
To open our hearts,  
And hold each other close,  
For just a moment—  
Before the night arrives?
