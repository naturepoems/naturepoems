The Woods

Deep in the woods where shadows hide, 
A hush enfolds the summer tide; 
Each rustling leaf, a sacred hymn, 
In nature’s heart, no light grows dim. 

The towering pines reach for the sun, 
While footfalls whisper—one by one; 
The world outside begins to fade, 
As deeper still, my heart is laid. 

The brook does babble, clear and sweet, 
While crickets chirp and frogs retreat; 
Each moment etched in time’s embrace, 
In woodlands old, I find my place. 

So let me wander, lost in dreams, 
Where nature’s beauty ever gleams; 
In every bough and every knot— 
The woods forever, know my thought.

- George William Curtis
