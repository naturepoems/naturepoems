As autumn’s breath ignites the leaves,
A tapestry of crimson and gold,
Nature prepares for her solemn retreat,
Whispering stories of seasons old.

The chill air bites, a prelude to sleep,
The harvest's bounty all gathered in hand,
Each tree stands still, a sentinel proud,
Guarding the memories of this vibrant land.

- Gustave Flaubert
