Evening Calm

As dusk drapes the sky,
The world gently exhales—  
Colors blend softly,  
Golden hues trace the clouds  
Like the final stroke of a brush.

The stars awaken in shy whispers,
And the moon clings to the horizon,
I walk in this beautiful glow,  
Where shadows play among the trees,
And night spins the stories of stars,  
Wrapping me in their sweet embrace.


- Robert Bly
