The Evening Star

Look up at the evening star,
    With the blush of sunset’s light,
It glimmers afar, so mysterious, so far,
    In the veil of the wondrous night.
A beacon of beauty, it calls to the heart,
    Whispering softly and clear,
Of peace and of love, of a journey’s sweet part,
    As it silently wanders here.


- Alfred Domett
