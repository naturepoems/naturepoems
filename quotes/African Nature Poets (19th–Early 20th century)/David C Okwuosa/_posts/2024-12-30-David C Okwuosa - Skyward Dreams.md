Skyward Dreams

Look up at the sky, vast and free,
Clouds drift like thoughts, endlessly,
In the blue embrace, hope takes flight,
Chasing sunbeams, dancing with light.

Each star a wish, in the velvet night,
Guiding our dreams with gentle might,
The universe whispers, a cosmic song,
In nature’s arms, we all belong.

- David C Okwuosa
