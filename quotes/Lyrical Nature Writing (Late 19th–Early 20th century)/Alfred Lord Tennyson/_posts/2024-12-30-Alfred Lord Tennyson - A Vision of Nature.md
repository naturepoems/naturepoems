O, what a vision fair 
  In the sun’s descending ray!
Majestic mountains, rocky bare,
  Where the silver waters play.

In the depths of woodland sighs,
  Where no lore of man can reach;
When the wild bird’s piercing cries
  Are uttered, without speech.

In the distance, brooding skies,
  Lo! a peace no heart can know;
Gathers softly, and supplies
  Calmness to the world below.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
