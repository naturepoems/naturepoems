The forest's deep umbrage,
   With its solemn shade,
Where the silence is sacred,
   And the wild things have played.

Here the rugged oak towers,
   The fir and the pine,
And the soft mossy carpet
   Makes a retreat divine.

Let me wander in stillness
   Through this tranquil place,
For Nature is the artist,
   And the world is her grace.

- James Fenimore Cooper
