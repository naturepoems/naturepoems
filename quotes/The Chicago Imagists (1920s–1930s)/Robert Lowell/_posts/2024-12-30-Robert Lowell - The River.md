The River
by Robert Lowell

The river flows,  
a silver thread through earth,  
cradled in ancient hands,  
a tale of life and loss,  
as it winds through time.

With gentle ripples,  
it speaks of whispers past,  
a journey unraveling,  
as it meets the sea,  
a timeless serenade.

- Robert Lowell
