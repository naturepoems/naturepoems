A WILD FLOWER

Oh, wild flower, blooming in hidden delight,
An orphan of the garden, wild and free,
Your petals collide with the breeze, take flight,
Cradling the sunbeams in laughter’s decree.

From cracks in the sidewalk, you rise, defy fate,
You paint the gray world with colors ablaze,
In memories whispered through soft winds that wait,
You whisper the truth in oh so tender ways.

Your heart beats in silence, the spectrum spreads wide,
The universe cradles your beauty, sublime,
In places where dreams and wild hopes reside,
A wild flower reigns, defying all time.
