Love
When love is strong, the heart will sing  
Of nature's secrets bright and rare,  
In every tree that sways in spring  
In every blossom rich and fair.
 
Let gentle time of toil unfold  
The truest grace of love's embrace  
Among the shades where light is gold,  
Let every worry find its place.

- John Clare
