A Night In June

In the heat of June, under the heavy sky,
The stars appear as reflections of desires,
And from the porch, I watch the fireflies,  
Floating softly above the marsh grass,
Glints of warmth on the cool evening air.
Nature swells to life, a lullaby of lightsâ€”
Each flicker a promise amidst a deep sigh,
Tempting the hours to linger in the calm,
Drawing us into the dance of warmth,
Until we are lost in the beauty of the night.


- James Wright
