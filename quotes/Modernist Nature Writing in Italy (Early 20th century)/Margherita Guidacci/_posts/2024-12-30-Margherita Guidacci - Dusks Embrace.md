In the hush of dusk,
everything is cloaked in blue,
like a shroud of mystery,
where the lake reflects
a trembling sky.

Fading light, a fading sigh,
the horizon swallows the sun,
while secrets drift on water’s edge,
whispers of the day’s farewell.

The night unfolds gently,
and the stars awaken one by one,
as since time began,
watching over the warmth we hold
in the embrace of the earth's breath.

- Margherita Guidacci
