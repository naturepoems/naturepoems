A Brighter Moon

The moon arrives, both brave and true,
A silver gem against the night,
Casting its gaze on sleepy fields,
While whispering secrets, soft and light.

It bathes the world in vibrant hues,
A palette rich with dreams and sighs,
A mural painted on the dark,
Where wanderers pause beneath the skies.

Oh, faithful moon, you linger low,
Companioned by the distant stars,
And as I tread this lonesome path,
You guide my heart through night’s memoirs.
—Louis MacNeice
