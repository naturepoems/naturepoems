The Song of the Brook

There came a brook from the mountains,
A babbling, playful brook,
It danced through the woods and the valleys,
With a lively little hook.

It whispered soft to the flowers,
And laughed with the butterflies,
Each bend it took, a secret,
Each turn, a sweet surprise.

- Elizabeth Palmer Peabody
