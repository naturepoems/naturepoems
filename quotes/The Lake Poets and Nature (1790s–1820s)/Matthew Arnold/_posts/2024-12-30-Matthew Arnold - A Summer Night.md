A Summer Night

A pleasant summer night!  
All nature fair lies sleeping around;  
The silent and the tranquil night  
Opens up her silver skies.  
The leaves are whisp’ring tales upon the trees;
And the moon’s face streameth down upon the earth,
Oh, wherefore can’t I fall asleep-
As a child of the light?  


- Matthew Arnold
