The autumn leaves fall, a vibrant dance,
In shades of red, they take their chance,
They twirl and spin, in breezes free,
A final bow to the resting tree.

Each leaf's descent, a tale profound,
Of summer's joy, now turned around,
In every crisp, rustling sound I hear,
The beauty of change, so perfectly clear.
