My love is like a shadow out of the moon,
   In silence, painted upon the half-lit dew;
Endless fields sway and memory seek, and soon,
And looks like this  —I seem to roam to you.
   Your beauty lingers on, as most fragrant spoons:

Give to me your warmth, rare hour of light,
   As if the day passed slowly to show the night:
Holding but a wonder like this early moon,
   All things allow our stay, to give us room.

— *To My Love*

- John Keats
