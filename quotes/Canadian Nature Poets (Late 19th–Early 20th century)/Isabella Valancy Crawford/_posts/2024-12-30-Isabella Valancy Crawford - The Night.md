The Night

Silence wraps the world in deep, deep sleep,
  The stars are but silver fire,
They twinkle, and glimmer, and gently creep
  As a shadow doth retire.

Down in the valley the crickets sing,
  And the branches sway and snap,
With the song a thousand memories bring,
  As the world is in a hush-wrap.

- Isabella Valancy Crawford
