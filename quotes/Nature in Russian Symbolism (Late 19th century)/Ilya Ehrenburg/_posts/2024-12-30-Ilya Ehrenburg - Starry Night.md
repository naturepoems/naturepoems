Starry Night
When darkness drapes the world so wide,
The stars ignite, like distant dreams;
Each twinkle holds a universe inside,
With whispered hopes and silver gleams.

The night, a canvas rich and deep,
Where shadows play and secrets soothe;
In cosmic silence, hearts will leap,
And find their way to tranquil truths.

- Ilya Ehrenburg
