Beneath the boughs, the shadows weave,
A tapestry that dreams believe.
With every rustle, life begins,
In whispered truths that nature spins.

A world untouched, so wild and free,
A place where spirits learn to see;
In every breath, a sacred bond,
With earth, with sky, the deep beyond.

- Elin Wägner
