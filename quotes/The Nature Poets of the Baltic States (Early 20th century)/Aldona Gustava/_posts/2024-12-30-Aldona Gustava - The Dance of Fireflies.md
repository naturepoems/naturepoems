The Dance of Fireflies
In the twilight's golden glow,
Fireflies twinkle, dance, and weave,
A ballet in the evening's slow,
In natureâ€™s realm, we dare believe.

Their lanterns flicker, soft and bright,
A spark of magic in the night,
Reminding us, in shadows deep,
To find the joy in silence steep.

- Aldona Gustava
