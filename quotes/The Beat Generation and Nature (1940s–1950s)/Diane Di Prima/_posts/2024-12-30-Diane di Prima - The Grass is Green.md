The Grass is Green

The grass is green,
this fresh promise of life,
luxuriant and full,
like the breath of spring,

bending under the weight
of possibility.
I lay down on my back,
watching the clouds pull away
the curtains of the sky,

revealing a blue that knows
no bounds,
a canvas for dreams
to dance upon.

Each blade of grass
a life,
rooted deeply
to the core of existence,
echoing the heartbeats
of all who dwell here,

reminding us that we are part
of this great cycle,
a thread in the tapestry
of the universe,

and the grass,
moving softly in the breeze,
knows our stories,
dances with our joys,
remembers our losses,

it is here,
in this rich earth,
where we find
our grounding,
yearning for the wild.


- Diane di Prima
