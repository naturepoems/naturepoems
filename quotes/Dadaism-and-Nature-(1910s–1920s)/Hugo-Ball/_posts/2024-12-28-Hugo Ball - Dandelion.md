Dandelion

How beautifully it floats,
This little yellow clock,
Fingers, wispy, delicate,
Scatter the air like smoke.

A hundred little wings,
Mimicking the clouds,
Fall fast to tease the ground,
Coated in dreams of gold.

No gardener’s hands—it conquers,
Cracks the stone, shakes the earth,
A small soldier, growing old,
In the warmth of vibrant birth.

The deadline is the sky,
And yet it simply sails—
A revolution flowering,
In the deep realms of tales.
