---

O quiet woods, you speak to me,
In whispers soft, and echoes clear,
Your secrets hide in every tree,
Your heartbeats draw me ever near.
Amidst your shadows, time stands still,
With every leaf a story tells,
In nature's arms, my soul’s fulfilled,
While peace and beauty weave their spells.

- Hamlin Garland
