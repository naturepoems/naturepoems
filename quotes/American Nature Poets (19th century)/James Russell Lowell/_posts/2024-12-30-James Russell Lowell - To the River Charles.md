To the River Charles

River of my childhood's days,
  Sweet the song you sang,
Leisurely among the trees,
  Softest glimmers sprang.

Tarry down in the tranquil vale,
  Let not storms dismay,
For thy banks shall never pale,
  And never lose their sway.

Beyond the mist above the tides,
  Where the green hills cling,
A harmony of joy abides,
  And the meadow's ring.

O lovely realm of visions free,
  Natureâ€™s fond embrace,
May I ever call to thee,
  And in peace find my place.

- James Russell Lowell
