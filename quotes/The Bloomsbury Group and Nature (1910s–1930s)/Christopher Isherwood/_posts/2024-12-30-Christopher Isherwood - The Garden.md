The Garden  
When you come to my garden  
All is peaceful.  
The leaves are grasping  
At the sunlight,  
In the soft breath of morning.  
They awaken slowly,  
With the scent of dew.  
And flowers bloom bright  
Against the dark shadows  
Of the old trees,  
Where birds chatter  
In joyous notes.  
Here I find my heartrest,  
The pulse of life  
Against the cries of men –  
Who trample and flee,  
Frantic in their cares.  
So step lightly,  
Let our feet blend  
With the swaying flowers  
And we’ll wander deep,  
In this garden,  
Steady.

- Christopher Isherwood
