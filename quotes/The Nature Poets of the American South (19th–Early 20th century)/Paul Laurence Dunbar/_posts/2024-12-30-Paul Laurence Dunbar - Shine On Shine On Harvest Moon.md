Shine On, Shine On, Harvest Moon

Shine on, shine on, harvest moon, up in the sky,
    I ain’t had no love since January, February, June, or July.
    Snow time ain’t no time to stay out doors.
    So shine on, shine on, harvest moon, for me and my gal.

The crows are croakin’ over head, the sparrows are, too.
    But the love light that’s in your eyes has got a melodious hue.
    A foggy night and a party time is just a sight to see!
    So shine on, shine on, harvest moon, for me and my gal.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
