Voices in the Wind  
Listen closely to the whispers in the breeze,  
As the wind carries stories from the leafy trees;  
Each rustle and sigh, a song that is sung,  
Of the life all around, while the world is still young.
 
The shadows interplay with the soft golden light,  
Awakening the senses as day turns to night;  
In nature's embrace, we find our own song,  
Where the heart beats in rhythm, and we truly belong.
 
For the voices in the wind are tales of the past,  
In their dance through the branches, the memories cast;  
So breathe in the air, let your spirit take flight,  
In the symphony of nature, find your delight.

- Frank Norris
