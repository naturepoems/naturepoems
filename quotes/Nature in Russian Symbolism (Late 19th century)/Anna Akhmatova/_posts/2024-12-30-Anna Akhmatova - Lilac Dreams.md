The fragrant scent of lilacs in bloom,
Brings visions of summers long since passed,
The gardens echo with laughter and song,
Whispers of memories that ever last.

In the tender brush of soft petals’ touch,
I’m reminded of love that unfurls with grace,
In nature’s palette, colors collide,
Creating a symphony time can't erase.


- Anna Akhmatova
