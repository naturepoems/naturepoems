Morning

Morning light flows  
  on the grass,  
  washes me like a small child  
 
I breathe low under birches.  
  The starlight runs deep;  
  The dew hangs low,  
 
Glistening where each bead  
  balances on a hoof,  
  or the crisp edge  
 
Of day to run louder—  
  on earthy blooms  
  and gentle hints,  
 
Where blossoms wisteria  
  rise on shadows of peace;  
  A hush within the hour.  

—Lola Ridge
