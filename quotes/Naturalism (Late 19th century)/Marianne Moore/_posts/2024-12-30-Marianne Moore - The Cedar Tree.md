The Cedar Tree
I dug an unqualified silence  
To the woodland settlers  
Of cedar scent and thunder  
Of foliageâ€™s richness  
A wild story unfolds  
In curtailments of light.

This tree is a gathering,  
In a by-the-way,  
The aromatic greenery thrives  
And clouds settle across its shade,  
Mid-Summer, beneath the wild sky.

Thought leaps in the fractures  
Between bird calls  
And dreams of coming together  
Over bramble,  
Where the cedar tree guards dreams of nature.


- Marianne Moore
