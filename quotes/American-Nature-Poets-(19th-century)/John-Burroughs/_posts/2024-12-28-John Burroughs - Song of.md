Song of Nature

I am the spirit of beauty, and here I weave
   My joys and sorrows, my joys into the light.
I am the voice of the winds, the sun’s bright ray,
   In the spring and summer, in the autumn’s array.

I am every flower that blooms, every stream,
   Beneath the blue sky, every bright star gleam;
I am the muse of the earth, the wild creature’s song,
   In my dance and my laughter, I ever belong.

- John Burroughs
