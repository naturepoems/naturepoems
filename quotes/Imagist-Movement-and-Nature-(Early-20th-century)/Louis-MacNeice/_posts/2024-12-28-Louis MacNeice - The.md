The Garden
   by Louis MacNeice

In the garden where the lilies grow,  
Stems stretched high as they bow,  
Colors blooming in sun's great eye,  
The air flows sweet as love's soft sigh.  
It breathes the essence of every leaf,  
The fragrance soaking up, like grief,  
Brings forth a world of pure delight  
As nature paints the fading light.

- Louis MacNeice
