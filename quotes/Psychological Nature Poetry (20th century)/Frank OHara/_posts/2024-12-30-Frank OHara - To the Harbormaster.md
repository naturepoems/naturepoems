To the Harbormaster
                         For John Ashbery
        You know,
        in a way it could be
so grand
        to be on the open sea
        but I prefer
        the quietness at the edge
of the water,
where the singing stone pools
        are cool and cold,
    waves brick by brick
            caressing the shore
and what marks the way
    is all that sunshine
        glistening like silver knives
on my face,
    but careful now,
        should we hurry through
            all that empty space.

— Frank O’Hara
