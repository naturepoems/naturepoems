To be child unto the wild,
born of the earth, a whispering night,
where once the flares of dawn brimmed,
you are the fruit of every ripe bloom.  
Let the rain be your veil and keep it light,
as sounds from streams points of flight  
through echo’s hands of wisdom,  
where the voice of both allows us this grace.
