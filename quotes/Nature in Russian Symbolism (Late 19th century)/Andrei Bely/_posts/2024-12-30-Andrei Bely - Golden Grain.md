The fields are rich with golden grain, 
Where whispers ride on summer rain.
In every heartbeat, life’s refrain, 
A balance struck, in joy and pain.

The clouds drift slow, dreams they weave,
As nature’s art begins to cleave.
In every heart, a longing to believe, 
That in her beauty, we too receive.

So take my hand, let us explore, 
This world of wonder, forevermore.
In her embrace, I’ll find restore, 
In nature’s realm, I long to soar.
