When the winter's chill hugs the earth so tight,  
And the frost wraps the branches in glittering white,  
I find a beauty in the cold's embrace,  
As the world sleeps gently, in delicate grace.  

The snowflakes fall like a whispered prayer,  
Wrapping the trees in a soft white shroud;  
In this quiet wonder, I breathe the air,  
And my heart beats softly beneath the shroud.

- Ruth Dallas
