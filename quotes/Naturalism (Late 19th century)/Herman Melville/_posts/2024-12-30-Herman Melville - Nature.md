Nature  
   
Oh Nature! thou art ever new;  
Thou give us joy, thou givest pain,  
Thy seasons change, thy skies are blue,  
Yet oft thy storms come down like rain.  
  
In quiet woods, where hues combine,  
And songbirds break the tranquil morn,  
In sacred groves, where sunbeams shine,  
In natureâ€™s heart, our souls are born.  
  
With fervent love, we gaze upon  
The painted hills kissed by the sun,  
In every whisper of the dawn,  
In every stream, our hearts are won.

- Herman Melville
