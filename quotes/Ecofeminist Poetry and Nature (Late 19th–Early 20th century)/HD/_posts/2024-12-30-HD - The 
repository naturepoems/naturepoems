The Wind

Like a grave silence,
the wind rests as darkness
   breathes its sweet scowl
   as it turns the weight
of a tiny stream,
entwined with blooms,
  blinds of the sylvan
  beneath a darkening glow.

The hush builds in layers,
dust to the shaking moor;
  a crack, a free pass,
dances in the clouds,
  drapes the pull of shadows
and leaves lent and flown.

H.D.
