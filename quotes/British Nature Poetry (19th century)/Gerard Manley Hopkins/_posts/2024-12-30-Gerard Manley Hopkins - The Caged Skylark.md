The Caged Skylark

As a dare and a sparrow or a caged skylark sings,  
Yelling halt, I swear I feel warm droppings of their wings.
Though as scatter candle and as many pieces bending back,  
The sun is but bright noise, this ground is but black.

I hear it high slung on the rail where bound, wailing strong,  
And in the untamed bush I feel their pull where sunlight throng.
Watch out for their perfect circle, I feel a note locked in here—  
An echo wild with a trite tongue when at last heard clear.

— Gerard Manley Hopkins
