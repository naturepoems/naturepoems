Among the Trees

Laughter of the trees rings clear,  
Where every branch does cast a cheer—  
And I walk leaning soft, so kind,  
Beneath their shade, among the blind.  

They wave and speak with the tilt of leaves,  
And sigh as hearts hold scarce reprieves,  
For broken the line, of morn and night,  
An example lives, trunks reaching so bright.  

Touched by the sun and kissed by moonbeams,  
Hushed by the night in layers of dreams,  
I wander here, to name my heart,  
And birth a language that will not part.

- Edward Thomas
