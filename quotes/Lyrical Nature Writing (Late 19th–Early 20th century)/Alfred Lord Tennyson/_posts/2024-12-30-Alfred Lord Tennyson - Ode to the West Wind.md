Ode to the West Wind,
  Spirit of the stormy seas!
Blowing o’er our rugged coasts,
  Bringing spring's yon fresher breeze.

Thou who darest to inspire
  Love in every living thing,
From the thistle to the briar,
  Whispered by the wild bird’s wing.

Send thy rays upon the dawn,
  Waken all the sleepy flowers,
And the woodlands, bright and yon,
  With their glancing summer showers.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
