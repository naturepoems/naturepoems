quote: "The sun retreats,  
Fingers of twilight  
Caressing the river,  
Where shadows dance  
Among the reeds -  
A slow fading,  
Each moment lingered."

The sun retreats,  
Fingers of twilight  
Caressing the river,  
Where shadows dance  
Among the reeds -  
A slow fading,  
Each moment lingered.
