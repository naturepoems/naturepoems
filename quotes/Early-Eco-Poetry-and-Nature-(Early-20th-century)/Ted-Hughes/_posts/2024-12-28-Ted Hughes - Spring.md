Spring
The wind had blown
A wild song that colored the trees,
Their branches thumbed along
the sky’s edge,
Fingers wide in joy,
a laugh—a shout.
It held spring like a secret,
in all its glory.
Golden eyes blink,
trees start life anew.
I wander where
the earth has turned,
where the spirits rise
and shadows offer hope,
renaming the world
in each new bloom.

- Ted Hughes
