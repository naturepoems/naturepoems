To traverse the terrain where wildflowers reign,  
Is to step into magic, to feel the pure strain;  
A riot of colors bursts forth from the earth,  
Whispers of freedom, of beauty, of worth.  

Each bloom like a smile in the sun’s golden glow,  
Unraveling secrets that Nature can show;  
With petals like velvet, they teach me to see,  
The richness of being, of life’s endless glee.  

Oh, let me wander on paths woven in light,  
Closer to knowing what makes my heart bright;  
In the presence of wildflowers, I find my own way,  
Embracing the beauty that blooms every day.

- Marcel Proust
