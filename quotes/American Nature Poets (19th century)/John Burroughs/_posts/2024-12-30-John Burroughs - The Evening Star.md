The Evening Star

High above the dusky vale,
Twinkling softly, a guiding trail,
The evening star begins to gleam,
Echoing the light of a summer dream.

Soft on hills, the shadows creep,
In the stillness, whispering deep,
Natureâ€™s night, a gentle balm,
In her embrace, the world grows calm.

- John Burroughs
