The Open Road
This is the place for joy and cheer,

The open road, where skies are clear,

The trees doth bow, the flowers blow,

Tinted by the sunâ€™s embrace below.

Happiness in every glade,

Steps in rhythm, freely made,

To walk with Nature, hand in hand,

To wander through this magic land.

- Richard Jefferies
