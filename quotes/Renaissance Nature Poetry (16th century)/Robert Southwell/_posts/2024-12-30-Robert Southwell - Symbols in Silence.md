The symbols shaped in silent earth,
Remind us of our humble birth;
With every leaf that falls from grace,
We find our journey in this space.
In natureâ€™s womb, we take our chance,
To grow, to wither, to advance;
A fleeting bloom, a fading sound,
In nature's arms, our truth is found.

- Robert Southwell
