In the quiet of twilight, when stars start to gleam,  
the world drifts into a soft, whispered dream.  
With the moon hanging low, casting silver on streams,  
it's a moment of stillness, where magic redeems.

The crickets will serenade the hushed evening air,  
while the world bathes in shadows, devoid of all care.  
In this tranquil embrace, where the heart can behold,  
the beauty of nature is a treasure untold.

- Émile Zola
