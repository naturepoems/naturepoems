A line will take us hours maybe;
Yet if it does not seem a moment, 
Must I then let it go free? 

Running in the space I know,
Running through fatigue and light,
And speaking of how I feel
And of how the earth is white. 

Through craggy stones and rain,
Through tenacious roots and light,
All I can see above me
Is a waiting leaf of height. 

Having stopped in the silence,
Those voices along the fade—
A line must go on throbbing;
But without the harm I’ve made.

- Robert Frost
