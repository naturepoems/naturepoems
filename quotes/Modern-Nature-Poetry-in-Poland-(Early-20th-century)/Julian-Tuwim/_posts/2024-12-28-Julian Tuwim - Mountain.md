Mountain
Above the clouds, the peaks stand proud,
atop the world, in solemn silence.
I gaze into the endless blue,
where the earth kisses the sky,
a realm of solitude and strength.
The winds carry tales of ages past,
a refuge that beckons, whispers,
reminders of how large we are,
yet how small, cradled in natureâ€™s hand.


- Julian Tuwim
