The Widow's Lament in Springtime
Sorrow is my own
eating me.
The wind blows cold
past the gray
weathered barn.
I have to feed
the animals yet,

like the red
fern,
but all the green
is gone now,
and I
forget the joy
of son’s
playful hands,
Now the sunlight
is gone
on the ground.

- William Carlos Williams
