author: Ezra Pound
quote: "The ocean waves embrace the shore,  
   in rhythmic pulse, a lover's sigh,  
   caressing rocks worn smooth by time.
    
   Sea gulls call, their cries a song,  
   as tides reveal the secrets held,  
   treasures lost, stories vast."

The ocean waves embrace the shore,  
   in rhythmic pulse, a lover's sigh,  
   caressing rocks worn smooth by time.
    
   Sea gulls call, their cries a song,  
   as tides reveal the secrets held,  
   treasures lost, stories vast.

- Ezra Pound
