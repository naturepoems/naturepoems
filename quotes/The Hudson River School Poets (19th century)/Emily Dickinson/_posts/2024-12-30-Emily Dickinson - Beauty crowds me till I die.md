Beauty crowds me till I die,  
Beauty, mercy on my soul!  
All the restless Beauty,  
Drifting through the skies –  

Her golden shafts above me,  
The meadow flowers below –  
The waterfall, so tranquil,  
I scarce can bear her grace.  

Let the River dance in wild,  
Open wide my shores of night,  
Let the Stars, with pulses bright  
Guide my journey, to thy sight.  

I look beyond horizons  
And into Flowering lands –  
A world of purple morning  
Where golden Beauty stands.  

"Beauty crowds me till I die"

- Emily Dickinson
