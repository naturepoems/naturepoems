The ocean calls,
a siren song of waves,
vast and open,
where horizons stretch forever.
Each grain of sand,
a story of time,
ripple in the expanse suggests
an endless rhythm,
a heartbeat of the planet.

As I stand at its edge,
I am both lost and found,
a wanderer in wonders,
forever seasick on the shores
of the infinite unknown.

- Octavio Paz
