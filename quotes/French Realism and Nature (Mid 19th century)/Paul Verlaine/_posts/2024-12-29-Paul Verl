By the shores of the tranquil lake,  
Where ripples tease the waking dawn,  
Natureâ€™s tapestry begins to wake,  
With new colors, an autumnal yawn.

The swans glide gracefully on the blue,  
Their wings weave through air like feathered dreams,  
While sunlit waters mirror crucial hues,  
Rippling softly in their radiant beams.

In this muted calm, what symphony plays?  
An aria of solace, of beauty fresh-born,  
As blossoms unveil in countless displays,  
Letting go of the dark, embracing the morn.

- Paul Verlaine
