The Oak

Beneath a mighty oak, I rest awhile,
His branches high like ancient arms of grace,
With the sunlight weaving through, a gentle smile,
The shadows dance and soft encircle space.

His leaves are tokens of a storied past,
As whispers of time in every rustling sound;
While roots run deep, to hold the soil fast,
In this sacred stillness, I am unbound.

O giant spirit of the woods so wise,
How many hearts have shared thy strength and trust?
In every tear that on this bark will rise,
A promise blooms, and in that promise, dust.

O shade of God, life’s passage finded,
In thy arms, all pain is gently minded.

—Felicia Hemans
