Across the Meadow
Across the meadow,
a whisper shakes the boughs,
trees dance in the soft breeze—
one foot after another,
dancing as leaves fly by,
them leaves caught in laughter.

Hidden laughter in birdsong,
where joy speaks of its return,
those voices call up the day,
reaching through wildflowers,
touching the earth with grace.

— Gary Snyder
