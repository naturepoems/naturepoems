Upon the mountains high and bold,
Where the sky kisses the earth at dawn,
The breath of nature fills my chest,
An elixir that enlivens my soul.

With every step, I claim the ground,
Feeling the pulse of ancient stones,
And in this communion with the wild,
I am ignited, fierce and free,
An echo of the mountains’ heart.

- Richard Aldington
