Inversnaid

This darksome burn, horseback brown,
  His rollrock highroad roaring down,
  In the lonesome light, in the lonesome light,
  To a Siledang, O, Siledang, sound!  

Like a black, slipping stone,
  Over blue, and the soft hush of the night.
  Thou art indeed a Nightingale.
  Fortune is a nightingaleâ€™s call.

The lark, the longsteal, brought to light.
  And the stars reach down,
  And my heart sings into the night.


- Gerard Manley Hopkins
