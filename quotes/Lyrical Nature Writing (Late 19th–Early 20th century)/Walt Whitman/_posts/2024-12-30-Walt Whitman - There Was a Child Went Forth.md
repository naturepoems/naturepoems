There was a child went forth every day;  
And the first object he look’d upon, that object he became;  
And that object became part of him for the day, or a certain part of the day,  
Or for many years, or stretching cycles of years.  
  
The sun and the moon, and the talking-glimmering sea,  
And the shadows of trees, and the children in school;  
  
And the young man, who was a naïve soldier, hath may become a thing of fun  
For slack jaws and some haunts of a drunken club-room  
  
- From "Leaves of Grass"

- Walt Whitman
