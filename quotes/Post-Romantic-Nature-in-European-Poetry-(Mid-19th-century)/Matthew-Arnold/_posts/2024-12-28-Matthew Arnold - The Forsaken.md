The Forsaken Merman

“Arthur, are you there?”  
Down among the angels,  
Sitting in the clamorous bay  
Where fashions weep along the shore,  
And edging mermaids tumble down;  
For nature waits upon a day,  
Shall rise more fit for you, my love.  
Long we waited; now in sight—  
Ride lightly, craft of mine, but light;  
And hear me, earnest whisper, breathe  
Where waters fall with endless flow.  

The surge of the brimming tide,  
The waves that tremble now and then;  
I need not go so far, my back  
Is drenched, but shall we roam the sea;  
Such dreams, though emptiness, are free.  

Silence this abyss, our yearning scars  
Shielding sirens, meet your gaze;  
The haunting dimensions roam as stars  
That see us from the winding shore.  
The dream of a still weightless form  
Is ever met where glimmer swells,  
These breezes roam forevermore.  

I wail among the lilies rare,  
Where no one listens, here I stand,  
Above the currents’ struck design;  
Their lilting snare spins to despair;  
Yet to think of waves unkind  
Can lift our hopes into the night  
Where leaves will fall, and love shall flow,  
Into the night where hearts grow bright.


- Matthew Arnold
