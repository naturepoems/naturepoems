The green under so many trees,
This hint of a blue sky,
The sharp air of a windy day,
It is in the fading twilights
Reflected in the faces of your friends.
You shall read the beauty of closed flowers,
This haunting color
Of dried grass in the sun.
It is the solitude, the moments,
Ruffled by currents of breezes,
That paint the world, as if,
To shed light upon the troubled
Nature of our passing days.

- Evelyn Scott
