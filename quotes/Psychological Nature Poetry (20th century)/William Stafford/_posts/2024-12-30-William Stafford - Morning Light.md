Every morning light brushes
   across the tender leaves,
    and the earth glows silently.
Breath after breath,
       we find our way
      to the beauty in waiting,
  how it beckons to be seen,
        to be understood.

As days turn into whispers,
   I walk barefoot
         on the grass of memory.
  Feeling each blade dance
      beneath my feet,
         I keep moving forward.


- William Stafford
