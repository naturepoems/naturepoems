In the glow of dusk, when the world turns to dreams,
The stars wink softly, like lanterns of old;
I wander the meadows, where loveliness gleams,
And the night wraps around me, a cloak made of gold.

Fireflies flicker, like whispers of light,
And the moon rises high, casting silver on grass;
In this moment of magic, I lose my way,
Yet find in the darkness, the beauty steadfast.

- Sigbjørn Obstfelder
