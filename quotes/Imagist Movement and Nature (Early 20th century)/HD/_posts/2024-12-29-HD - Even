Evening

The swallows cut alone,
    For the sun stretches its face
Through the dim, shadowy wing,
That slowly becomes a cloud,
Lighting—lifting the shore.
      Shade brightens over green thickets 
      The dense bafflement of leaves,
As sloping tangles drown dusk,
Swathes shrouded in roots.

&nbsp;

The violin sounds the sweet, rare notes—
    A luminous rising,
Gather the broken leaves, and the drift near,
        Nature awakens with beauty.

— H.D. (Hilda Doolittle)
