Through the Trees

Oh, the dancing waves of the cypress trees!  
See! their branches bend and sway,  
Fluff on the dusk of summer’s eve;  
When the street lights are overlooked,  
In emerald pools, they sink,  
To a hush, when the swallows come singing!  
For summers and winters have both gone before,  
And nature sings that night—  
When with stillness no thoughts will remain—  
Yet cross again on the day of the trees!

- Lesbia Harford
