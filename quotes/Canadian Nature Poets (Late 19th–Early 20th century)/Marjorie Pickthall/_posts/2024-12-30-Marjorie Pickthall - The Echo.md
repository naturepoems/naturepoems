The Echo

In the mountains, a voice will call,
A whisper through the pines that sway;
The echoes of time, both rise and fall,
In nature's arms, forever stay.

Each tone a memory, soft yet loud,
Resounding through the hills, the air;
As if the earth itself is proud,
To hold the songs of all who care.

- Marjorie Pickthall
