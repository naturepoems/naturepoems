Upon the River’s brow, a silver night,
The Moon’s bright herald scatter'd from afar,
A soft, pale beam, like the warm thought of light,
Has sat upon this restless beast, like spar:
As if with vernal vigor it might grow,
To pierce the woods, and knit the sea with gold.

Then glimmered through the trees the elf-like glow,
The wild yet ancient song shrill, and cold,
Leaving but sorrow on the lonely shore;
So gather we, in treason, to the flood,
The rivers of our tears—to the very nature,
To silence, endlessly wise, and understood.

So now, as thou fade, I remember thee—
Have sighed enough for being one with thee,
No less, on this bright sea of tranquil flowing,
Than the spark that shone like hope, and as if going nowhere, serenely now, still and ardently crying.

Where in the foam, my heart can find its rest.
Maybe it is all—taken from the breast,
Fulfilling that dear enchantment more—in a woe.
I shall not murmur more, for now, para todo.

- Lord Byron
