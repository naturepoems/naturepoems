O thou that art the Gate of Heaven,
I lift my heart to thee;
To thee I look, to thee I cry,
To thee I bend the knee.

The clouds are dark about me now,
But I believe in morn;
I feel thy power in the light,
And in the dew of dawn.

Would that I might but sing thy praise,
With music sweet and clear,
And all thy treasures tell, O Lord,
So all the world might hear.

- Lady Mary Wroth
