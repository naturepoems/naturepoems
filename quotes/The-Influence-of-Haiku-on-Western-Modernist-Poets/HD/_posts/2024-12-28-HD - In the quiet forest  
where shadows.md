quote: "In the quiet forest,  
where shadows merge and flow,  
i hear the pulse of the earth,  
a heartbeat beneath the leaves.  
Each step is a prayer,  
a seeking of refuge,  
nature cradling heart and soul."

In the quiet forest,  
where shadows merge and flow,  
i hear the pulse of the earth,  
a heartbeat beneath the leaves.  
Each step is a prayer,  
a seeking of refuge,  
nature cradling heart and soul.
