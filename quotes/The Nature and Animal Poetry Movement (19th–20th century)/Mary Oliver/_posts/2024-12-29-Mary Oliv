Blackwater Woods

In the darkening of the trees,
in the increasing heat,
the owl calls,
that cries,
you may hear in a shadow,
a sound good and kind.

Here, the day grows warm,
yet rather unaccounted,
its cries of sisterly frights.
Carried all in our embrace,
will flow to the lake.

Oh, let it enter,
enter us some more.

All that will be meaningful,
we gather, the moon,
how she refuses to shine.
Give me a bush today,
or leave it in slant,
as we drift down.


- Mary Oliver
