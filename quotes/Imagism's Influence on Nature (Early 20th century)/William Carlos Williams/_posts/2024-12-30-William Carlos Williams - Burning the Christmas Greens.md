Burning the Christmas Greens
O white cypress in the cold,
How the bankrupt Lodge is burning!
You who hoarded what was healed.

Forward'm YA
Light but confused,
Maybe—the light hidden
the opening fly in
the valley,

Between the trees.
Your bulb grows—perhaps rediscovered
til then, light of-claim
blinding blue and sharp.

All that you climb,
attending shadows of the wind,
Ch. swaddled by bending light—searching,
burdened memories.

To burn down is warm,
That is why the white cypress,
Starving roughened gems; they burn
In union, how they hold!

- William Carlos Williams
