Beneath the Baobab
Beneath the baobab, wise and grand,
I find solace, a sacred land.
Its gnarled branches stretch and reach,
In silence, the world it teaches.

From dusk till dawn, stories unfold,
Of ancestors' whispers, brave and bold.
This ancient tree, steadfast and true,
A reminder of the past, ever anew.


- Oda Ndukkor
