Ode to the Rising Sun  
 
Sunrise paints the world anew,  
With colors bold and brightly true;  
The dew-kissed flowers open wide,  
To greet the dawn, nature’s pride.  

Golden beams doth pierce the night,  
Casting shadows in the light;  
Whispers of the morn’s embrace,  
Bring forth life in sacred space.

- William Henry Channing
