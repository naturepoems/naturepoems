In gardens where the daisies bloom,
Beside the paths where shadows creep,
A world of life finds joy, not gloom,
Where love each secret promise keeps.

Wildflowers paint the meadow bright,
The chirping birds, their songs of cheer;
So in this setting of pure light,
I cherish Natureâ€™s essence dear.

- Joyce Kilmer
