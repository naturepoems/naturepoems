Eclipse

A moment hangs, suspended in awe,
the sun a reluctant guest,
as shadows dance across the land,
a cosmic waltz of light and dark.

The moon, bold, asserts its reign,
a silken veil across the day,
and in this fleeting enchantment,
we pause—I watch, you breathe.

The universe winks,
a collective heartbeat,
time dissolves into reverie,
in the eclipse’s embrace,
we are tenderly reminded—
every union, unforeseen yet destined.

- Polia de Montalcini
