The mountains stand like sentinels,  
Their peaks adorned with snow;  
They guard the valleys, streams, and wells,  
Where wildflowers constantly grow.  
They speak of ages long before,  
Of earth's great tales and ancient lore;  
A majesty that time can’t mar,  
A witness true, a guiding star.

- Bessy H Elliott
