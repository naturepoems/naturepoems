A Dream of Death
O to be in the calm of a flower,
That everywhere’s been out of the storm,
Her life responsive unto light’s hour,
Wherein I cast forth prayer and calm.

To be a bird in a branch so free,
A sound in kind and breathing mist,
Against the mouth where the roses flee,
And blind about her life, a sweet tryst.

Could a dream break free from the signals?
Would that scent be a springing fault?
But in dreaming I wander beneath each bough,
For nature’s a tinct of a thoughtless sea. 

And my buds burst forth at spring’s full call
To match the moon in poised midnight.
Yet the wings it gives to the loam, though tall,
Can yet mute the echoing light.

- William Butler Yeats
