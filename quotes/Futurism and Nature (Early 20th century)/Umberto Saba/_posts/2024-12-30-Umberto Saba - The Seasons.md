The seasons turn, a rhythmic dance,
Each moment a brushstroke on time's canvas,
Spring bursts forth with vibrant life,
While autumn whispers of memories past.

Summer's warmth cradles the earth,
In a golden glow that beckons forth,
And winter wraps the world in silence,
A hush that holds the promise of rebirth.

In the circles of nature, wisdom lies,
Teaching us the art of letting go,
For in each ending, a new beginning,
In this cycle of life, we learn to grow.

- Umberto Saba
