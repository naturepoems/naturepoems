---

O, how they flaunt, the forest glades!
In every leaf a story, ever-changing
Yet constant as the stars,
As nature pens her poetic verses,
In a language understood by few.

Rustling of the twigs, the shadows,
Carry tales from the depths of the earth,
While the daisies catch the sunlight
With delicate smiles,
Winking at passersby.

- Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
