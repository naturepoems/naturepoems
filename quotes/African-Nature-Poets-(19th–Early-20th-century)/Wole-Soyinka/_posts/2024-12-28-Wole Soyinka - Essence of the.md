Essence of the Valley
The valley lies in peaceful repose,
In emerald skirts that softly close,
With shadows playing in gentle light,
And daydreams weaving through the night.

There, the echo of laughter rings,
In high-pitched calls of hovering wings,
Where the blush of the flowers paints the morn,
And melodies arise like dreams reborn.

In quietude, let me dwell,
Within the arms of nature's spell,
With every breath, I feel the tune,
As life unfolds beneath the moon.

- Wole Soyinka
