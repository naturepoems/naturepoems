The Moon was but a Chin of Gold  
A Night or two ago –  
And now she turns her perfect Face  
Upon the World below –  

Her Forehead is of Amplest Blush –  
Her Cheeks – a Beryl Heave –  
All Rosy – She will rise again  
Whenever— I believe –  

The Windy West leaps after her  
And Vows its Love will do –  
And that will carry her to me  
As Sweetest – ever – true –

- Emily Dickinson
