The mountains shall echo the songs of the breeze,  
where the heart finds its solace beneath rustling leaves.  
With the weight of the world cast aside for a while,  
each moment a blessing, in nature's sweet smile.

When the storm clouds arise, and the thunder resounds,  
the earth breathes a sigh, as it shifts all around.  
In the arms of great nature, I find strength and peace,  
for in her wild beauty, my worries release.

- Émile Zola
