The river’s song, a lullaby,
That flows between the earth and sky.
With gentle curves and laughter bright,
It brings the stars to kiss the night.

In rippling tones, the moments blend,
Nature’s symphony, without end;
The heart can rest by waters deep,
In crossing tides, our dreams to keep.

- Elin Wägner
