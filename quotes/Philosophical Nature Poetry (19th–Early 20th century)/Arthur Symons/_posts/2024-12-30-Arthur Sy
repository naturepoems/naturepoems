The Nightingale

In lyrics soft, the nightingale,  
Sings out its heart of song;  
Yet whispers fade, like dreams that sail,  
Where shadows drift along.

And in the dark, I hear the tune,  
It carries through the air;  
As night fades into light of moon,  
The music lingers, rare.


- Arthur Symons
