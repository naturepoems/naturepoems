A Summer Evening

The evening hush enfolds the day,
The sky alight in hues of gold;
Upon the banks where waters sway,
A tapestry of life unfolds.

The crickets call, a soft refrain,
While twilight weaves its spell anew,
And in the stillness, peace remains,
As nature shares her quiet view.

Here in the summer’s warm embrace,
All worries slip like grains of sand;
In every breath of starry space,
I find my soul in nature’s hand.
—Louis MacNeice
