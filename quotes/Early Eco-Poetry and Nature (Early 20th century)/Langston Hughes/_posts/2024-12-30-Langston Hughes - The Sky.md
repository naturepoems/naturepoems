The Sky

Overhead the sky,
Stretching into forever,
The clouds drift and sail,
Like thoughts unbound.

I breathe in the blue,
The freshness of the wind,
Carrying stories,
From places unknown.

The light dances on leaves,
A melody of green,
While shadows play games,
In the playful sunbeam.

The sky is a canvas,
A portrait of dreams,
Where the eagles soar,
And the larks sing streams.

- Langston Hughes
