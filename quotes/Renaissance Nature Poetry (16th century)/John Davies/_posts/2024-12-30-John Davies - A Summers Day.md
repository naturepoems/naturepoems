A Summer's Day

When summer days adorn the skies,  
With joy the earth remembers all;  
The laughter echoes, time then flies  
As flowers dance and raindrops fall.

The sunbeams fetch a golden ray,  
And kiss the land where shadows play;  
O summer, warm, and bright, and true,  
Your presence gives our spirits due.

In fields where joys are found anew,  
May we drink wisdom from your stream;  
For on this day, love will imbue  
The heart with silence, soft as dream.

- John Davies
