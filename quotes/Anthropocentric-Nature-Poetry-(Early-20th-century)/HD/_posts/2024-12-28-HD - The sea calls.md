The sea calls forth,
as a siren sings,
beckoning with long tides,
a gentle ebb and flow.

Each wave carries stories,
from distant shores,
a language of foam and salt.

I walk along the sand,
feeling the footprints of time,
as they wash away,
leaving only a whisper.

Natureâ€™s echo is eternal,
and I find my voice in her song,
melodies of the deep.
