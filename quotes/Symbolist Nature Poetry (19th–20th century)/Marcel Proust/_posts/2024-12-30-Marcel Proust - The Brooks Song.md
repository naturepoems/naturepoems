A brook flows softly through the verdant green glade,  
In the cradle of Nature, where dreams never fade;  
Every droplet a story, every ripple a song,  
Together they whisper, 'You will always belong.'  

The sun plays a melody in shadows that waltz,  
Filling the air with a fragrance that exalts;  
In the laughter of water, in the rustling leaves,  
A tapestry woven of all that believes.  

So let me wander this sanctuary, pure,  
In the heart of the wild, I'm forever secure;  
For in Nature’s embrace, my soul learns to sing,  
In the hymn of the earth, I find all that I bring.

- Marcel Proust
