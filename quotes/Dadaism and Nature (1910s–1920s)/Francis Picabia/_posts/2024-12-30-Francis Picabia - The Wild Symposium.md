The Wild Symposium
Nature gathers for a wild symposium,
a festival of feathers and fur;
the birds chat with the bees
and the trees offer their wisdom,
a tale spun in the sunlight.

We are but observers, mingling,
as the sun melts into the horizon,
a playful blush across the sky;
watch as the day captures the night,
a dance of shadows and light,
an eternal celebration of life.


- Francis Picabia
