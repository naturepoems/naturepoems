Nature's Choir  
The rustle of dry leaves  
forms a chorus for dawn,  
a ballad to beginnings,  
a sunrise painting the sky  
in hues of soft awakening,  
earth’s primal laughter  
breaking through night.

In the blossoms,  
time’s finger traces  
the delicate veins of petals,  
the sun peeks  
in random places,  
a hypnotic pulse,  
each bloom a bright question,  
a response woven  
in the fabric of existence.

Listen!  
Every chirp,  
every sigh  
adds to the ensemble,  
a nature’s symphony,  
a cacophony of grace,  
touched by infinity.

- Richard Huelsenbeck
