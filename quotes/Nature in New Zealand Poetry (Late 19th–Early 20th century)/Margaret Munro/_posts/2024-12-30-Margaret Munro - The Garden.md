The Garden

In my garden, wild and free,  
The flowers sway, a symphony,  
A cacophony of hues and scents,  
Where every blossom's beauty bends.

The bees do hum, the birds do sing,  
A chorus to the joys of Spring,  
And in each petal, soft and bright,  
Lies promise wrapped in pure delight.

Oh cherished spots, my heart's retreat,  
Where earth and sky and spirit meet,  
In nature's arms, my soul takes flight,  
In gardens pure, my heart ignites.

- Margaret Munro
