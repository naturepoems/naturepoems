I cannot count the people I have known,
They have grown older as the seasons pass,
And their voices fade like the sounds of the dawn,
And I fear I will forget they were ever here.

The wind has whispered to me all the nights,
With the darkness settled as the day was lost,
And I saw their faces shine through the clouds,
Abandoning me like the light from the stars.

But one is left; a friend through all the years,
An echo soothing as the secret of the woods;
He softly sings to the leaves that wander,
As the dawn comes and my heart returns home.

- Robert Frost
