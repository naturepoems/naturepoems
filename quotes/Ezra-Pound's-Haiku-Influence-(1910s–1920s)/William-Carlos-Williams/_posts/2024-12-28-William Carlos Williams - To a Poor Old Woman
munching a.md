quote: "To a Poor Old Woman
munching a peach,

I propped a door

to Sophia,

and the flesh
of the peach

is ripe.

How the tree
sheds its leaves,

and I too
before you,

silent in the breezes.

Nothing is done

with its final sweet,
in the moment

of heedless joy."

To a Poor Old Woman
munching a peach,

I propped a door

to Sophia,

and the flesh
of the peach

is ripe.

How the tree
sheds its leaves,

and I too
before you,

silent in the breezes.

Nothing is done

with its final sweet,
in the moment

of heedless joy.

- William Carlos Williams
