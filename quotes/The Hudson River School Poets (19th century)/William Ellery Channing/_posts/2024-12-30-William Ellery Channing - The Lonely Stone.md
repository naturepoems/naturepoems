Upon the hill, a lonely stone  
Reflects the sky, the clouds above,  
In silence, whispers are intone,  
A testament of strength and love.  

Enduring time, yet meekly stays,  
A witness to the sunâ€™s warm light,  
In shadows cast by fleeting days,  
It holds the beauty of the night.

- William Ellery Channing
