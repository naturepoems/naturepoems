To Heaven

Whoever is, here as a listener,
  Profound as the skies,
He hears a great sensation at last,
  That purifies the wise;
And nature plans our measures,
  In the sacred night,
All things will surely tell,
  Whatever obtains the light.

   On that sea of silence,
   Thou art the truest climb,
And as she hovers near,
  All that we love, in rhyme.

- Ben Jonson
