The fog is rolling in, a sleepy ocean,
a great velvet blanket draping the trees.

The river murmurs softly to the stones,
as the world slows down, held in its breath.

Time unwinds slowly in waves,
young dreams float across the dim shore.

Hear the whispers in the leaves,
they are tales of long-forgotten paths.

A world wrapped in silence, softly unseen,
a dusky realm where spirits murmur.

And in the heart of nature, replete and vast,
there lies an echo of true belonging.

- Kate Bush
