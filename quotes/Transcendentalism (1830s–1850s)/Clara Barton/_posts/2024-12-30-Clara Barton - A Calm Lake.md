A Calm Lake

Reflecting skies in tranquil grace,
The azure mirror of the lake;
Where every ripple marks a trace,
Of dreams, that in the silence wake.

With gentle waves that softly lap,
The shores of thoughts that come and go;
In this embrace, the world’s a map,
Where peace and stillness freely flow.

- Clara Barton
