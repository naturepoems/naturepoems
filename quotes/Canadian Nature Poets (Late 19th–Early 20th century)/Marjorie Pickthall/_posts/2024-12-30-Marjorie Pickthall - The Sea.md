The Sea

The ocean breathes, a rhythmic sound,
In waves that kiss the sandy shore;
Its song resounds, profound, unbound,
A timeless dance forevermore.

Each tide a fleeting, tender grace,
Each breeze a sigh upon the land;
In nature's vast, enchanting space,
The sea holds secrets in her hand.

- Marjorie Pickthall
