The mountains rise in regal splendor,
A sight that stirs the weary heart,
Each rocky peak, a proud defender,
Of secrets nature guards, apart.

With snow-kissed crowns they touch the sky,
As rivers wind through valleys wide,
In silence grows a boundless sigh,
As earth and heaven softly bide.

- Charles Baudelaire
