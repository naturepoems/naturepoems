Spring
When grass and flowers fill the land,  
Handling all that blooms bright,  
Red blossoms lend their velvet hand,  
Breathing warmth where day takes night.
 
Bees in throngs, they hum along,  
And nature brings forth waves of cheer  
From deep within the colored throng  
That bursts in laughter through the year.

- John Clare
