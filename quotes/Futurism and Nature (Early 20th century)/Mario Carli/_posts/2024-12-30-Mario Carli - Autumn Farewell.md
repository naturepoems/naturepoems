Autumn Farewell
Leaves turn to crimson and gold,
A fiery farewell to summer's grace,
As the sun sinks lower in the sky,
Casting shadows long and golden,
The earth prepares for rest,
Nature's quiet lullaby,
In the crispness of air,
Echoes of change,
The sigh of the world,
Letting go of abundance,
To embrace the stillness,
A promise wrapped in frost,
As winter waits,
For the slumbering earth,
To heal and be reborn.


- Mario Carli
