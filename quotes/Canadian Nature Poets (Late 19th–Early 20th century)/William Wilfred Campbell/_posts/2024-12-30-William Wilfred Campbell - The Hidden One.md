The Hidden One

Here in the autumn woods I roam,
  A lonesome heart of mind,
  Where every leaf and every foam
  Is whispering shadows blind.

A hallowed peace invades the air,
  And through the sycamore,
  The tiny wildflowers bloom elsewhere,
  But oh! my heart is sore.

For here, the quiet beauty lies,
  In simple things so dear,
  Where every twinkling star that sighs,
  Is love that lingers near.

- William Wilfred Campbell
