Autumn's Embrace
The leaves, they whisper of changing lives,
A tapestry spun of gold and brown,
As autumn cradles with gentle sighs,
The beauty the earth will lay down.
In this harvest of fading light,
The chill winds dance through the trees,
All natureâ€™s song is bittersweet,
But alive is the breath of the breeze.



- Julian Grenfell
