The Village
The village sleeps beneath bright stars  
With hills as guardians of its fold;  
The quiet woods, the silent cars  
And every small heart's hand to hold.
 
Where sunlit steps will guide our way  
The coolness grows from softening shade,  
And evening's calm will hold our stay  
To dream within the light weâ€™ve made.

- John Clare
