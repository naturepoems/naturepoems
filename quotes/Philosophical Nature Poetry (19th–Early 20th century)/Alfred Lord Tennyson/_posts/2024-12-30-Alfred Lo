Birds of passage, you and I,
Whos' joy is in the meadows high,
O let us fly! O fly away!
No more shall our hearts be marked by day;
But in the moon's sweet serenade,
We'll rest, and never be afraid.

They soar and they sing above the wood,
And find their home in Solitude.
For every leaf in the budding grove,
And every drooping flower thereof
Bears witness of our wish to roam,
Like the twittering birds who've found their home.

Oh, take me, dear, away, away,
To the shadow realm, sweet night and day,
Where the daisies crown the long, green hills,
And the tangled vines in rapture wills.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
