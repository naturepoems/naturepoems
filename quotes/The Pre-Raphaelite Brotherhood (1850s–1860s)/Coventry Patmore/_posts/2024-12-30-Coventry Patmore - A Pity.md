The clouds shall help, sweet canopies,
To smooth the anxiety.
Of love who bears the leaf.
While wandering on bended knees,
With a pity, shall bless the day,
Yet encumbered hours lay, lost in the leaves.

O that flowered glory and peace,
Whose touching hands could ever bring]
Each breath that shown with such joy amiss,
Linger the length of a golden ring:

- Coventry Patmore
