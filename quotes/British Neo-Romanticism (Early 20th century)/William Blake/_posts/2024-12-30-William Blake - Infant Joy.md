Infant Joy
I have no name:
   I am but two days old.
What shall I call thee?
   I happy am,
Joy is my name.
   Sweet joy befall thee!

Pretty joy!  Sweet joy, but two days old,
   Sweet joy I call thee
   Thou dost smile,
And I am Glee;  I come and go,
   For the evening falls so slow.
And when the afternoon
   Does rise, you shall delight.

- William Blake
