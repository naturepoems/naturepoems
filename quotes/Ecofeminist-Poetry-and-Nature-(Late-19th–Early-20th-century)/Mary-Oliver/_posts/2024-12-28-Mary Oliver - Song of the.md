Song of the Builders

Ladies and Gentlemen,
cast your eyes on the bricks
that make the town.

And cast your eyes along the
comforts of cinders,
and gaps between trees—the
creek sweetly singing.

The builders are whispering,
each one, each for himself—and
the world, they say, needs
more grey bricks
and more wildflower.

This is the first song.
—They build slow,
one with silence—not as you
might expect,
but with the caution of open hands.
