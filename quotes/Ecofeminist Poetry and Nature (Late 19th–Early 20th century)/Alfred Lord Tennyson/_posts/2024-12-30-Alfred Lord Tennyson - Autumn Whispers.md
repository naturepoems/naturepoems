Autumn is here, with a blush on the leaves,
Dancing flames in the fields of gold,
Whispers of frosts, where the spirit weaves,
Echoes of harvests, the stories told.
As the murmuring rivers keep time in their flow,
With the sighing winds that haunt the night,
We pause to remember the colors aglow,
In the waning hours of fading light.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
