THE EVENING STAR

O evening star, that hangs in bliss  
Above the land and the creeks and pines,  
You’re a lighted mantle sewn with kiss,  
Where orb and heaven intertwines.

And all the air is still, still sweet  
With freedom’s quiet, just like you;  
My heart in the night and quiet beat—  
Where is the light that makes me true?

But still you burn with your glorious shine,  
Like a jewel lost in the heart of night;  
And all my longing to be divine  
Can feel your strength, and also bite.


- Bliss Carman
