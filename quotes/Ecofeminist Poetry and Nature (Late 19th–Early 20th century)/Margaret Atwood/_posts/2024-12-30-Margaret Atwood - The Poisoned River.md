The poisoned river,
Where the banks are steep,
Where the wind carries
Shadows, lined pools of
Dead fish and tires,
I stood  and watched,
Leaning, the world stammers
Against the quiet.
In the creek, willows droop,
Ripples swirl like thought,
Across the surface; but underneath,
The silent hulls are a world.
The trickle belies
What we take for granted, the water,
Vibrant, alive in
Darkness, hushed.
The trees sigh out a story, and
The air runs thick with echoes.

- Margaret Atwood
