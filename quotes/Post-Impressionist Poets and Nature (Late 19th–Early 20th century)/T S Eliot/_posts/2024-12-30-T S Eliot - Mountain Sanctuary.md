Mountains high, their peaks kissed by the sky,  
   Stand like sentinels, where eagles fly.  
   The whispering winds carry stories untold,  
   Of ancient spirits, and legends of old.
   
   Through valleys and streams, where wildflowers grow,  
   Nature's canvas blooms, with colors aglow.  
   In this sanctuary, we seek and we find,  
   The essence of life, in the stillness of mind.

- T S Eliot
