Darkness

I had a dream, which was not all a dream.
The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars
Did wander darkling in the eternal space,
Rayless and pathless; and the icy earth
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;

Mourning its own, as annihilation came.
So solemn the pit of silence, and the gloom
Was full of sighs and dead features grim.
Yet all round echoes of a vague dread voice,
Crowded by horrors there;â€”and still I stood, 

And on the ravaged bosom, all was naught
Yet even so, the wild fugue resounded forth;
Pausing, clasped as in an embrace, one form,

- Lord Byron
