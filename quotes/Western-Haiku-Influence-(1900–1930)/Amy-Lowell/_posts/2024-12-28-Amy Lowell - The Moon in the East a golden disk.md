author: Amy Lowell
quote: "The Moon in the East, a golden disk,  
    Flecked with stars, hangs low in the sky.  
    I stand still in the dark, and think  
    How softly my heart can sigh.  

    The night is a silver-blue,  
    A cool breeze dances with the leaves.  
    Each breath is a whisper of dew,  
    Each moment a memory weaves."

The Moon in the East, a golden disk,  
    Flecked with stars, hangs low in the sky.  
    I stand still in the dark, and think  
    How softly my heart can sigh.  

    The night is a silver-blue,  
    A cool breeze dances with the leaves.  
    Each breath is a whisper of dew,  
    Each moment a memory weaves.

- Amy Lowell
