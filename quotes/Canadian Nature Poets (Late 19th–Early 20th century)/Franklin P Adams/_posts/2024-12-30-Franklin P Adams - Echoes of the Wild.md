Echoes of the Wild

In valleys broad and mountains high,
Where eagles soar and shadows lie,
The wildness calls, the heart obeys,
In Nature’s arms, we spend our days.

From roaring rivers to silent glades,
In every breeze, the spirit fades,
And peace is found where wild things roam,
In nature’s wild, we find our home.


- Franklin P Adams
