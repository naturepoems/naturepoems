Sea Grapes

Sea grapes grow here,
  tangled in roots of sand,
  pressed by the sea,
breaking the silence, crashing
  the patterns over and over,
  tiny green bumps
made small blankets, a layer
  against the breeze.

I see how the waves
  admire round shapes,
strung together in a line,
 slipping away but knowing
  they surge back;
  the moon counts the moments
sand scratches against skin,
  restores the body to nature
  without apology.

- A R Ammons
