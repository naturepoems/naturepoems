Nightfall in the Forest  
As daylight fades, the shadows creep,  
The forest sighs, begins to sleep;  
The stars above like lanterns bright,  
Guide wandering souls to rest at night.  

The babbling brook in whispers low,  
Sings of the day that’s gone, and so,  
In nature’s arms, we lay our heads,  
And dream of peace on mossy beds.
