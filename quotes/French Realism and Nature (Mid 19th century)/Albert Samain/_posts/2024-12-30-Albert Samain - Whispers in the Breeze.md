Whispers in the Breeze

In the depths of the golden fields,
Where time slows, and silence yields,
There’s a tune in the gentle rustle,
Of the grass, the air, the subtle hustle.

A melody weaves through the trees,
And dances with the honeyed bees;
It carries tales of the earth’s embrace,
Whispered softly in Nature’s grace.

Each breath a benediction shared,
With every sigh, the heart bared,
Like lovers entwined, in the shade of dales,
Lost in the beauty where life prevails.

Here are the secrets of the day,
In the whispers of the breeze that sway;
To be alive is to know this frail,
In the meadows and hills, we shall prevail.

- Albert Samain
