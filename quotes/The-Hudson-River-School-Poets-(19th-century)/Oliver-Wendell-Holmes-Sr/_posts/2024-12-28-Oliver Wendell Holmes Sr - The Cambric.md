The Cambric Shirt

A shirt? A lovely, slumbering word,
Like lullabies my children heard.
A ray of light on racks of grey,
Like fabric woven, night or day.

There’s beauty in every thread that glows,
The yarn of life that surely flows.
Softest touch, to embrace the skin,
In time-worn sleeves, new life shall spin.

O gleaming cloth, in dizzy race,
A gentle shimmer, nature’s grace,
Brought forth from tide, where men do meet,
A gift from worlds whom we compete.

- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr
