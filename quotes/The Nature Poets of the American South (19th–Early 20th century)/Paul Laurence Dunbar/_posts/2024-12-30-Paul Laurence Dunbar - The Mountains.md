The Mountains

Hark to the sound of the sea!
  Pressed in the hills like a pearl,
The mountains are dreaming of me,
  And the winds of the soft, green world.

They whisper a lullaby sweet,
  In valleys of silence and shade;
And I wander, with soft, noiseless feet,
  Where the song of the bird never fades.

I know not the purpose of dreams,
  Nor the end of the night’s mystery;
But the heavens are bright with their beams,
  And I see, in the silence, I see.

So glorious the message that they bring,
  Floating down to the valley’s end;
The mountains are dreaming the thoughts of the spring,
  While they beckon the stars to descend.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
