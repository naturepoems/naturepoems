Against the stones, the sea roars,
Short breaths of wave and spray.
Each tide, a capture of will,
Each retreat, a promise sowed.
The churning churns,
And I, in stillness, wade,
Measuring time in wet foot prints,
Running and still, tracing lines,
Each grain of sand a memory,
Carved and swept—  
What rises and falls, then
I come to know the salt,
Of fingers reaching into spaciousness,
Skeletons soaking in whispers
Of home and horizon.

- Margaret Atwood
