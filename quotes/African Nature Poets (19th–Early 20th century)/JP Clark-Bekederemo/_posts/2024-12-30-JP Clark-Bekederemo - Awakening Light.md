The sun peeks through the clouds,
A golden ray, a warm embrace,
It spills upon the river,
And sets the waters aglow.

The fish leap in joy,
Creating ripples of laughter,
As the world awakens,
To a bright new chapter.

Life is a palette,
Where colors blend in light,
Nature’s art unfurls,
In the warmth of day’s bright.
