The Emperor of Ice-Cream

Call the roller of big cigars,
The muscular one, and bid him whip
In kitchen cups concupiscent curds.

Let be be finale of seem.
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.

Take from the dresser of deal,
Lacking the three glass knobs, that sheet
On which she embroidered from the top,

The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.
Let be be finale of seem.
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.
