I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,
  And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren,
  And the tree-toad is a chef-d'œuvre for the highest, and the dirt of the earth is just as grand,
  And a cow is a masterpiece, and a snail is as wonderful as the rose!

— Walt Whitman, "Leaves of Grass"
