Whispers of the Pines

Among the towering pines, I find
The gentle whispers of the wind,
Their needles glisten, soft and green,
Where nature's heart beats deep within.

Each breath of breeze, a timeless song,
That carries tales of ages past,
In sunlight’s glow, the shadows long,
Embrace the earth, forever vast.
