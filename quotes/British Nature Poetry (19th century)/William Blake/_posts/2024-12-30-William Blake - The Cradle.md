The Cradle

In the cradle of the night,  
Moonbeams weave through the trees,  
A gentle whisper, a tale, a slight,  
Love's sweet breath in the evening breeze.  

See the river, softly flowing,  
Where shadows dance upon its breast;  
With dreams and thoughts of love all knowing,  
The hearts of creatures find their rest.  

O let us linger and abide,  
In the arms of a starlit sea,  
For in the night's embrace we ride,  
On the waves of eternity.

- William Blake
