The Quiet City
In the city, the night brings peace,
And the stars are like jewels against a velvet sky,
The trees stand tall like guardians,
As the world whispers softly by.

In the moonlight, the streets are silver,
And the quiet beckons to be free,
For in this hushed moment,
The heart can truly see.

- Langston Hughes
