Winter's chill enshrouds the land,
A blanket of white coats every scene,
The world transforms, quiet and grand,
In slumbered peace, a white serene.

Footprints mark the frosted ground,
A dance of life beneath the snow,
In nature's pause, a silence found,
As seasons change and softly flow.

- Richard Wagner
