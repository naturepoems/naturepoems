The Pond

In the sweet intimacy of the pond  
I call to the ducks  
and we are all free—  
a solid movement toward light,  
for who could resist?  
Out in the stillness,  
where the water glimmers  
with silver,  
where reeds sway  
in the wind's gentle breath,  
so I too would linger  
down among the cool waters—  
for who could help but love  
what doles so graciously  
to the journey through life?

- Mary Oliver
