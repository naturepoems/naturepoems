The Lonesome Road

A dusty path winds far away,
Through fields of golden grain,
Underneath a sky so vast,
Where dreams and silence reign.

Each step a thought, a memory,
As crickets serenade the night,
With the rustle of the leaves,
And the fireflies' flickering light.

Here, in solitude, I wander,
Among the stars and gentle breeze,
Finding solace in the lonesome road,
Where my heart is free to seize.

- John Thompson
