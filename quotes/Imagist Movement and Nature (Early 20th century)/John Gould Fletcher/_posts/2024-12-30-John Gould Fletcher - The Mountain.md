The Mountain
High where the air smells sweet and pure,
The mountain towers, proud and steadfast,
Wrapped in mist, a cloak of grace,
It watches the world below,
While stars twinkle like thoughts in the sky.
Cloaked in silence, it whispers deep,
Of times long past, of tales untold,
It is the heart of the earth,
Pulsing with life, a sacred space.


- John Gould Fletcher
