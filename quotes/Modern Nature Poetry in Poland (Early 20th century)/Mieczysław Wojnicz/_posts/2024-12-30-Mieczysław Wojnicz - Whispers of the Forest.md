Whispers of the Forest
In quiet woods, where shadows dwell,
The forest sings its ancient spell,
With every breeze, a sigh of trees,
A harmony that brings us peace.

The tales they tell, the secrets shared,
In every trunk, a heart laid bare,
As we traverse this sacred space,
In nature's arms, we find our place.

- Mieczysław Wojnicz
