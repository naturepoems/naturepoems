Cascades  
Here, where water tumbles  
into gleaming stones,  
a symphony of whispers  
greeting my wandering soul—  
I swim through droplets  
tagged with sunlight,  
a refreshing echo  
of ages gone by.

Ferns unfurl their arms,  
a forgiving embrace,  
each tending heart,  
complicit in the flow,  
in the dance,  
in the ecstasy  
of this moment—  
a contact with the eternal.

- Richard Huelsenbeck
