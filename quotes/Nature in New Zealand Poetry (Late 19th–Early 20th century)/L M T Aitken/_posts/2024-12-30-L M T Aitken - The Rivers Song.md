The river's song flows soft and low,
   A lullaby of pebbled grace;
With gentle tides, it winds to show,
   Each tale of earth, each ancient face.

It carves the land, a lover's trace,
   And bids the traveler pause and mend;
With every bend, a sweet embrace,
   The river beckons, friend to friend.


- L M T Aitken
