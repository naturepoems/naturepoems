The Whispering Wind

The wind that sings through ancient trees,  
Bears tales of love and flights of ease;  
With every gust, it whispers low,  
Of journeys far, through fields aglow.

It calls the wanderers to roam,  
Across the hills, to find a home;  
In rustling leaves, a languid plea,  
For hearts attuned with Natureâ€™s glee.

O Wind! Spirit bold and free,  
In you lies magic, wild decree;  
Guide my dreams as you dance and sway,  
Unfold the path that leads the way.

- Alphonse de Lamartine
