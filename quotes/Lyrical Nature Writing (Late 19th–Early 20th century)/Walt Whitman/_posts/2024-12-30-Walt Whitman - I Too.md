---

I, too, sing America.  
I am the darker brother.  
They send me to eat in the kitchen  
When company comes,  
But I laugh,  
And eat well,  
And grow strong.  
  
Tomorrow,  
I’ll be at the table  
When company comes.  
Nobody’ll dare  
Say to me,  
‘Eat in the kitchen,’  
Then.  
  
Besides,  
They’ll see how beautiful I am  
And be ashamed—  
I, too, am America.  

- (not traditionally a nature poem, but relates man to earth)
