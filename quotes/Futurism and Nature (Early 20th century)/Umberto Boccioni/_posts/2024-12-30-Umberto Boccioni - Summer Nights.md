Summer Nights

In the warmth of twilight,
every star becomes a lantern,
a guide for dreams
that meander through the air.

Fireflies flicker,
a dance of forgotten magic,
as children chase the glow,
weaving time in their laughter.

The air hums with cicadas,
a symphony of nature’s heartbeat,
as shadows stretch and fade,
and the earth breathes deep.

With each moment,
a subtleness ignites,
a reminder of life’s fragility,
a celebration,
a gratitude,
a spell cast upon us
by the night’s rich embrace.
