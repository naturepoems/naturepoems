Fading Colors

The sunset paints with a frown,
All the colors wearing a crown,
Swirls of red, of yellow, of grey,
Chasing the light of the day.

Forgotten in blushing hues
The night casts its tender blues,
Stars whisper amongst the shadows,
Where nature's quietness flows.

The fading colors, a gentle sigh,
As the sun dips low, and we wonder why.
Nature embraces the dance of the dusk,
In shadows, we seek what the day may husk.


- Richard Huelsenbeck
