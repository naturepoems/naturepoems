The End of March

The cold depths of March; green, even, rusted.  
Foolish  
gradual light, strange warmth.  
When rocks show their shivering,  
and the cross where paths cross,  
edges, coats, and sounds where they are free.  
A multitude calls.  

Where the stars, light screens with their constant lights,  
yearning, even willing  
for nationality—not waiting or aiming.
Who hung the wintry fair sky—
a shock of frost, and the red night-bird  
that knew, in laughter of cries, I was here  
yet.  

Drive people this time—slowly please  
sheltered bird—against darkness;  
from edges clam and riddle.
And though it is cold,  
it is only that spring wins in the end;  
this way, stone to stone—after all.

- Elizabeth Bishop
