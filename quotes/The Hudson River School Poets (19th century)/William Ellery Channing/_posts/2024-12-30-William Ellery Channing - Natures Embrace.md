In nature’s quiet, hearts unite,  
With every sunrise, every star,  
In open fields, we find our light,  
And know our place, no matter far.  

For in the winds, our dreams take flight,  
In flowers blooming, love is cast,  
In nature’s arms, we find delight,  
A bridge between the future, past.

- William Ellery Channing
