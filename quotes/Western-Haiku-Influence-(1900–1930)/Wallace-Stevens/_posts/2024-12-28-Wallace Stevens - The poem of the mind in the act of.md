quote: "The poem of the mind in the act of finding what will suffice.
It has not always been this way.
It was the dream of the tree, far-off and long-hidden.
The yearning of the leaf to touch the wind and thrum.
And here, outside of town, brings the sky low to the hills."

The poem of the mind in the act of finding what will suffice.
It has not always been this way.
It was the dream of the tree, far-off and long-hidden.
The yearning of the leaf to touch the wind and thrum.
And here, outside of town, brings the sky low to the hills.

- Wallace Stevens
