The New Year

With every turn of time's embrace,  
  Comes hope anew and bright,  
As winter wraps the world in grace,  
  And bids us greet the light.  
The snowflakes dance on the chilly breeze,  
  Like stars that wander down,  
To cloak the earth in icy plumes,  
  As nature dons her gown.

While whispers of the past retreat,  
  The heart is bold and free,  
To breathe the promise of the year,  
  With joy and harmony.  
And though the storms may oft arise,  
  To test our strength and will,  
We rise in faith like tender buds,  
  Where hope blooms on the hill.

So let us welcome all that's new,  
  With laughter, loud and clear,  
As we embrace the change ahead,  
  On this bright New Year!  
And with the dawn of every day,  
  A chance to grow and learn—  
The gentle breath of nature speaks  
  Of love that we discern.
