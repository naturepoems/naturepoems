There's a certain Slant of light,  
Winter Afternoons –  
That oppresses, like the Weight  
Of Cathedral Tunes –  

Heavenly Hurt, it gives us –  
We can find no scar,  
But internal – as a Siberian Cat  
Ineffable to Wounds –  

When it comes, the Landscape listens –  
Shadows – hold their breath –  
When it goes, 'tis like the Distance  
On the look of Death –  


- Emily Dickinson
