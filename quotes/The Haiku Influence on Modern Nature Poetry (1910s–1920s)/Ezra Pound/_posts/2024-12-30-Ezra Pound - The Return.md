The Return
The spring and summer bursts over,
     The cry of the warblers in the blue;  
Naked the valley, washed with dew.
   None can feed.  
She will not rise to this, here—
    The spring of a maiden, you lean and take hold.
By the fall, the fall will come and go;
   Great shadows are fading, traced, shadowing out,
And no one can whisper against the stones.

- Ezra Pound
