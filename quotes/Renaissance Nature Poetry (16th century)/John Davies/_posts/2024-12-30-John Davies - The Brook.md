The Brook

O brook, that dances through the glade,  
Your silver laughter calls with ease;  
Through rocks and branches, unafraid,  
You weave a tale upon the breeze.

With every ripple, you impart  
The music of a thousand dreams,  
In gentle flows you touch the heart,  
And whisper life with joyful gleams.

May I reside by thee, sweet stream,  
In nature's arms, a place so dear;  
For here, reality blurs to dream,  
And every moment holds you near.

- John Davies
