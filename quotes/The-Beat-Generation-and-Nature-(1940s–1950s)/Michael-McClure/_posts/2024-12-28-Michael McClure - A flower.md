A flower blooms
    in the silence,
        the heart unfolds in awe,
and in this moment,
    there is beauty,
        there is hope.

Let us touch life
    in its wild abandon,
        laugh with the wind,
and dance with the shadows.

This is nature's gift,
    the promise of eternity,
        the breathing of stars.

- Michael McClure
