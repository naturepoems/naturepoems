Though thorns surround, the rose yet blooms in grace;  
Though trials vex, the heart shall find its way;  
For every storm that sweeps across this place,  
A song of strength emerges from the fray.  

Let nature teach the truths we oft forget:  
To rise anew, from shadows, take our flight;  
In gardens wild, the blooms no threat;  
That every struggle births a guiding light.

- Charlotte Smith
