Seasons turn, and the river
     flows as thoughts might,
     carving paths unseen
    into the heart of the land.
Its secrets murmur softly,
   and if you listen well,
       they will tell you everything.

A journey begins with silence,
   where the surface breaks,
   and the heart
        can surface too,
   just as the light
          moves through the trees.


- William Stafford
