In the days when the world was still
With the peace of an ancient day,
In the heart of a quiet hill
I dwelled upon my way.

But now my steps are drawn away
To the surface of the earth,
And all the voices seem to say
That silence gives me birth.

So beckon out the light of morn
To guide me through the dark;
Then let the sun like hope reborn
Illume my path, my mark.

- AE Housman
