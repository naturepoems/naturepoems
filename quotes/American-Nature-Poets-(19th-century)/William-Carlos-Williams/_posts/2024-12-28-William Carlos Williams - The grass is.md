The grass is singing
in a gentle tone
like a whispering child

so close to the ground,
where the earth knows

its history and trails
of time in the roots.

I walk with bare feet 
through the lush greens,

feeling the warmth,

and save the soft thrum
of nature beneath me.


- William Carlos Williams
