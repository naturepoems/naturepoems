Birches
When I see birches bend to left and right
Across the lines of strong bent boughs, I like
To think some boy’s been swinging them.
But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay.
Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
After a rain. They click upon themselves
As the breeze rises, and the snow’s in curls,
And the wind works their branches. I’d like to go
Back to be. It’s the anticipation of that
Which makes me bend, to see the trees bend and twist
Fitted to their ways.

So I think that is why I see them, the
Soft white movement at the edge of my vision.
I’d like to be sure as I clasped them
Though there isn’t a grip. It’s just their nature
To bend and twist; their sway is satisfying all the same.
It's just that I want the feel of it; to see what it is
Makes them bend; not just one particular tree,
But all of them bending, everywhere.
I want to be so steady I can see the clasping
Like as if from a hive filled with wasps,
Here. So keen a satisfaction it gives me.
If I got the chance, I would take
Those birch trees bending down to the earth,
And hold them close; closer than the wind, as the wind whines,
To have them always in my hand to see,
Those curls of trees still bending down before the weight of the snow.

I would hold them so I would not forget the bending
And the swaying, the gentle feeling of it.
That natural way is the charm behind every one.
I will never be able to bend those trees,  
To clasp the wonder of it with my two hands,
To feel the weight; to rock and sway like branches
Of trees in space. I want to hold them close,
Like those happy boyhood years, remembering how
Those trees bent to my warm, unknowing hand.
I would love to be acquainted once again  
With those birches then, though at a distance I can see them  
The way we once used to see each other’s hearts,  
So close, touching again those trees.
Where are they swinging; those trees whose hands I would clasp,
To feel their full, happy shafts of yellow-green in summer,
In winter our arms like whistle-wane trees,  
To reach, as lovers do, back in their trees
To bond those winters and the loneliness that holds us too,  
In alien arms. I hold them within my heart fondly.
Bending out of sight, and reaching to establish
What we once knew so well.
