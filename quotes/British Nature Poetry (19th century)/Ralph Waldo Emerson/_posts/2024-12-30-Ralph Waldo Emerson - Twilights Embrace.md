In every sunset’s vibrant hue,
The sky bursts forth with colors new;
Such beauty stirs a deep desire,
Awakens thoughts, ignites a fire.

To paint the world in shades of gold,
To fill the hearts of young and old;
Such simple joys the earth bestows,
In every twilight’s warm repose.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
