The Thing

For the mountains that smile,
For the rivers as they flow,
For the clouds that hang gently,
I bow my head, feeling them near,
An embrace of who I am, 
And thus all becomes whole—
As if every rock, tree, and glimmering star,
Manifest the essence of all beauty.

For each thing I touch or see—
I give breath back to life,
For what exists—the blade of grass,
The stones of the stream—
Are made alive through my gaze,
Echoes found in all that I see,
Heavens scattered, calling.

In this, I feel myself grow,
As a single soul dances
With every experience embraced,
So that I dwell ever deeper,
In the essential bond renewed,
With every breath of nature and sight.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
