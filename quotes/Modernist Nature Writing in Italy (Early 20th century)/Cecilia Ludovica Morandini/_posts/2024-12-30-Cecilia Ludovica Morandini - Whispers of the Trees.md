Whispers of the Trees

In the stillness of the night,
trees whisper secrets,
breathing tales of ancient times,
swaying gently to the rhythm of the wind.
Their roots delve deep,
anchoring stories in the soil,
while leaves dance like flutters of a dream.

Life pulses through their bark,
as sunlight spills soft over branches.
Beneath this green cathedral,
we find solace, a sanctuary,
as nature's breath cradles our hearts,
a symphony of rustling harmony.

- Cecilia Ludovica Morandini
