Fallen Leaves

Crisp underfoot,
  they crackle, colorful,
a passage into silence,
  a reminder of growth.
The trees wave
a slow good-bye,
each leaf a word,
a story-length returned,
holding the earth in bright mist;
a touch fades into something closer.
They remain
  until winter breathes,
    brings the weight of cold,
but still—the breath of the earth.


- Robert Creeley
