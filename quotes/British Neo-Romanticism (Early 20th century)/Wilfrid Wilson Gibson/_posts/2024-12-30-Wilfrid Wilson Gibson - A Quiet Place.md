A Quiet Place

In lands where silence caresses the earth,
And winds weave soft through forgotten ways;
A quiet place holds its tales of worth,
Through fading light of autumn days.

Here, shadows linger, and whispers bend,
To tell a story that the heart can hear;
Of love and loss in a gentle blend,
With nature's chorus, serene and clear.

So come and rest in this tranquil space,
Where dreams unfold in the softest light;
In every breath, find a warm embrace,
And let the heart awaken to the night.

- Wilfrid Wilson Gibson
