On a Quiet Morning

Above the quiet shadows thick with sun,
A longing rests with the soft brown ties;
Where creeping vines in mute consent have spun,
Along the path where the stillness lies.

Listen close to the wind-soaked airs above,
All drawing forth from the earth’s calm heart,
Sustained by grace we lightly touch but love,
In the rhythms where every breath imparts.

Repose your thoughts as the bright blooms unveil,
A gentle hymn read over fields aglow,
For marveling eyes shall see what is frail,
And know the unity found in the flow.

- John Crowe Ransom
