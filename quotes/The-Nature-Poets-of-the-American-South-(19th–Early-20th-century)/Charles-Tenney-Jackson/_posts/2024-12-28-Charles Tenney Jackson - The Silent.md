The Silent Night
In stillness of the balmy air,
When stars aglow in dark are set,
The world’s a dreamer’s playground rare,
Such tranquil peace, we won’t forget.

Each leaf, a whisper; each brook, a song,
The night enfolds, the shadows blend,
In Nature’s arms, we drift along,
Where all is peace, where moments mend.

Bid not the silence e’er depart,
But treasure all the beauty bright,
In every corner of the heart—
We find ourselves in Nature’s night.

—Charles Tenney Jackson
