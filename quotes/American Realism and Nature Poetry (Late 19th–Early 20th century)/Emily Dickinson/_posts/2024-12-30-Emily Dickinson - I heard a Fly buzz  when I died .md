I heard a Fly buzz – when I died –  
The Stillness in the Room  
Was like the Stillness in the Air –  
Between the Heaves of Storm –  

The Eyes beside – had wrung them dry –  
And breaths were gathering sure  
For that last Onset – when the King  
Be witnessed – in the Dark –  

I willed my keepsakes, secure –  
Signed away what portion of  
Me be assignable – and then  
There interposed – a Fly –  


- Emily Dickinson
