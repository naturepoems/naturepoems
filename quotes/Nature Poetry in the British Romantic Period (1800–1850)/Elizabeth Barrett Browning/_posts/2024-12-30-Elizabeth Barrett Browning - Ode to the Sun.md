Ode of the Sun, who shines so bright,
Illuminates both day and night.
Your rays touch every leaf and flower,
A witness to creation’s power.

Upon the mountains, deep and vast,
Your golden glow forever cast.
In every moment, every breath,
In nature's beauty, life, and death.

You are the light that brings us hope,
The guiding force to help us cope.
In every sunrise, every moon,
Resides the promise of a tune.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
