Nature's Promise

Here in a silver-gray morning,
it sat upon a leaf,
quiet and still, waiting,
as if to keep a promise intact.
Close to nature embodied,
in the wet glow and the eyes of sun,
a moment, soft and breathing,
a lagging stillness is ripped open.
He embraces green, the pale dew grasps tight,
as color slips through fingers,
yet they still obstinately cling.

*—Marianne Moore*
