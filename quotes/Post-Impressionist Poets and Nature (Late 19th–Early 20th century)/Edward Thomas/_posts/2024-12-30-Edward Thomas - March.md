March

Came yet another March, as spring  
Stood shy in the sun and giddy spring  
Came through the bright and gentle haze,  
Of flowers brimming the fields to blaze.  

Yet thoughts of winter held their ground  
And mellow evening bade the sound  
Of visionary dreams take flight,  
In woeful days of pitchy night.  

But flowers in fields of rippled light  
Illume the green, and offer delight;  
Where shadows dance, unguarded dear,  
For every petal knows no fear.  

So raise your eyes, and take your seat,  
On fields that gift renewal sweet;  
For spring is here, and yet to soar,  
And sing on through to its core.

- Edward Thomas
