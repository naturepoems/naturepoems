The Fish
Wade in the water  
Through the gleaming rock.  
Not a trace of time  
As you glance up at me—  
I cannot read it.

You slip  
Beneath the surf, beneath  
The golden curtains  
Of sunlight,  
And that’s good.  
All that is is good.  
You should stay.  
I want to remain,  
Where water is where you are!

In the circle of water,  
A thread of life  
Is netted in bright black.  
Other fish, bent to their fate,  
But I long to reach—  
How do you feel  
In this deep world?  
I am breathless for you—  
Banished from the above!  
Please stay,  
Where fish are,  
And shadow warms the skin.


- Marianne Moore
