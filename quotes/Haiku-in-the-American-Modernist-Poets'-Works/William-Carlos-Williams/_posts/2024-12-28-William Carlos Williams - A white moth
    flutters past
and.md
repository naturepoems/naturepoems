quote: "A white moth
    flutters past
and through the dance
    of blades of grass,
green beneath the sky,
    it flits and loiters.

               So does memory.

A white moth
    flutters past
and through the dance
    of blades of grass,
green beneath the sky,
    it flits and loiters.

               So does memory.
