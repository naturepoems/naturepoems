title: Gertrude Stein
description: "An avant-garde American poet and art collector, Stein experimented with form and style in her writing. While not a Haiku poet in the traditional sense, her works reflected a kind of minimalism that resonates with the brevity and imagery of Haiku, often exploring the relationship between language and visual art."
