Nightfall in the Woods

The day departs, a slow retreat,
As shadows thicken in the glen,
And the stars blink awake, so shy,
A jeweled tapestry again.

The hoot of an owl breaks the silence,
A soft rustle in the underbrush,
Each sound a heartbeat in the dark,
And the woods dissolve in a hush.

Moonlight spills like silver wine,
Across the tranquil forest floor,
Where dreams drift on the quiet breeze,
In the arms of a night that holds so much more.

- John Thompson
