Across the waves, the oceans speak,  
In their ebbing and flowing grace,  
Each crest and trough a heartbeat lost,  
Reflecting life's unending chase.

The gulls cry out their age-old song,  
Their wings embraced by salty winds,  
While the horizon beckons forth  
To places where the journey begins.

Oh, the beauty of the stormy skies,  
With clouds like brush strokes fierce and bold,  
Nature's canvas painted wide,  
A story waiting to be told.

- Andrej Ērgļs
