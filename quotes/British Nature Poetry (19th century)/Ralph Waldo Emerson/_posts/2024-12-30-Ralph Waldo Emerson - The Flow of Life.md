The mountain stream, so clear and bright,
Flows freely in the morning light;
Its waters carry tales untold,
Of nature’s grace, of life’s great hold.

Each ripple whispers soft and low,
A message only few can know;
The wisdom found in earth’s embrace,
In every flow, we find our place.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
