In the Home Stretch
I would not in the garden have a single patch raise
Without the tangle of the trees that weave the sun
And pull the sunshine bright like glows from weeks as one,
To bring this air into the boughs that bend.

For the tangle, it seems more human, like life,
Only built so ground to grow beyond what weights are breast-fed,
Or crouched with weary roots as if the eye was sought to see,
And from the yielding strings the ground need not be broken.

Among their leaves the days may birth at last;
This patch is all dear, it is here at last,
And I would die among the leaves that ought to mourn a thing,
To wrap their tangled light, a chill—a gift that brings.

So drive me from the wine-halls many have.
I had better dream only the trees might touch,
And gather as they tell above the hums of nature's sway.
My eye would the rest await before it breaks.
For the burden weighs, and tends to heal the toil,
Across what scent has grown—who then could fail?

- Robert Frost
