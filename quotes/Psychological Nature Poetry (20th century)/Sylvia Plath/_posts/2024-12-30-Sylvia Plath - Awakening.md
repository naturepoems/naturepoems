Beneath the thawing ground, a stir,
  In the quiet heart of winter,
  There lies a fire, still warm,
  A new green courage waiting,
  Among the crumbling remains
  Of the old—where the frost,
  Had once dressed the decay.
  The sun breaks free — a flicker.
  It casts a net of warmth,
  And hope wells up like spring.

- Sylvia Plath
