The flowers of the night are waking
 And the dew is heavy on the leaves.
 The moon is a light hand on dust,
 Soft as the stir of a lover's breath.
 In the cool night,
 The leaves break forth in laughter.
 The flowers are wings of light.
 They say, ‘Find me, oh find me,’
 Covered in silk and dew.

- Carl Sandburg
