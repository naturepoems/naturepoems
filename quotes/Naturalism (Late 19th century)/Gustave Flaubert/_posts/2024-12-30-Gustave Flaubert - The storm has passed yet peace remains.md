The storm has passed, yet peace remains,
Upon the brow of mountains steep;
And in the valley, life regains,
Its vibrant dance from winter’s sleep.
The snowdrops rise, the sun breaks free,
In nature's cradle, we awake;
To witness every seedling’s plea,
A promise born, for fresh earth’s sake.


- Gustave Flaubert
