The Song of the Trees

In the forest, the trees stand tall,
Guardians of Earth, their whispers abound.
With arms outstretched, they beckon us all,
In their shade, the spirit of life is found.

Leaves rustle secrets on the wind's breath,
They talk of seasons, of growth, of decay.
In their presence, we are reminded of death,
Of the cycles of life that shape our stay.

Oh, noble trees, your roots entwined,
In deep embrace with the soil you crave,
You teach us resilience, the strength of the mind,
In the gentlest of glances, the heart to be brave.

- Pablo Neruda
