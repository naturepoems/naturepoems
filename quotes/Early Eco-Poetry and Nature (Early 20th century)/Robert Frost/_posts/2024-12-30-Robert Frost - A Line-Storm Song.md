A Line-Storm Song
The line-storm clouds are gathering fast  
The sun is gone before their eyes;  
The shadows of the slanting rain  
Roam eager, ere love calms the skies;  
Long, shifting showers through the woods are waking  
And calling forth the wood’s repose.  

And I shall wait till it passes away,  
Or hold the stirrings near the wind  
Of the wild rush of every heart  
The deeper pulse with rain has turned  
And, just beyond the edge hair hot,  
I look for sunshine where even time  
Might blend within the silver curves  
The black that frames the weather green and wide.  

Each must rest apart, enter the line,  
That we both might see the two entwined;  
Then dance if love would leap in rain,  
A summer’s passing tender, born anew,  
And let us miss through each other as we try  
As life finds life in song and does not wait on me;  
The laughter comes and fades, through night and day,  
And I shall be past loveliness adrift with ease,  
In whispers beneath the fading splendor  
Of all that shimmers on the bending trees.

- Robert Frost
