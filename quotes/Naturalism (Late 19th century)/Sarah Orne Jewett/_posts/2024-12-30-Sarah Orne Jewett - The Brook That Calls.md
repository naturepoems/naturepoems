The brook that calls in busy glee,
   With effervescent cheer,
   Dances along in merry spree,
   And sings for all to hear.
   It bends to kiss the mossy stone,
   As woven grass doth blend,
   And at the edge where flowers croon,
   The ebbing currents bend.
   So life’s unbroken melodies,
   In nature’s hesitating song,
   Bring forth the peace that never flees,
   And carry me along.

- Sarah Orne Jewett
