In twilight’s soft and tender glow,  
The hills rise high, their shadows long,  
Nature holds her breath, awaiting night,  
As stars awaken, bright and strong.  
The crescent moon, a silver bow,  
Draws the night’s cool breath with ease,  
And in that balance, calm and clear,  
We find our place amongst the trees.

- Ellen Ballance
