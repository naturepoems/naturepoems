Snowy Night

Through the snowflakes falling,
in the silence of the night,
i find myself outside, looking up,
at the white world where dreams are made.
The air is crisp, the stars bright,
the moon a radiant glow,
a painting of stillness,
where time stands still.
Each flake a memory,
a journey from the sky,
a promise of a new beginning,
that wraps me in a gleeful shiver.
I close my eyes against the chill,
let the stillness wash over me,
each breath a promise,
a moment of pure grace,
as I embrace everything
that life gives,
sweet and tender flight,
this snowy night,
where the earth becomes a canvas
for joy and wonder.

- Mary Oliver
