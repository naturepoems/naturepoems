O how I love when day’s retreat,
Ushering in the night so sweet,
With whispered tones and golden hue,
The soft embrace of twilight blue.

The bluebells paint the glades anew,
A dance upon the dusky hue,
And as the evening stars appear,
A chiming brook offers its cheer.

The echoes of the hills unfold,
With stories that the winds have told,
O'er moor and dell, in peace are laid,
The whispers of the heart conveyed.


- William Wordsworth
