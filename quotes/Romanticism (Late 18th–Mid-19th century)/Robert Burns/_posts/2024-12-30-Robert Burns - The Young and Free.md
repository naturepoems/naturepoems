When you are young, the sun shall rise,
And bloom upon your brow;
Where flowers blossom, green hills lie,
The world is yours, behold.

For every path that leads you far,
Shall mark your heart’s design;
In nature’s mirror, set your star,
And let your spirit shine.

So tiptoe through the sylvan glade,
And cherish all the free;
For life’s a song where love’s conveyed,
To bless eternity.

- Robert Burns
