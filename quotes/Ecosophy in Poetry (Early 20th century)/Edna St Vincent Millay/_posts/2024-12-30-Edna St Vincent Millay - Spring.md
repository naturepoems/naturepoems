Spring  
  ------  
To what purpose, April, do you return  
  Again?  Bare branches and the black  
  1on the ground  
Have opened your strange beauty to the sun;  
’told me it was to see you here  
  Again in the spring.  

  I know no joy in this small hour.  
  All this beauty and I  
  Do not feel the wind stir;  
I see the trees and hear the fallen rain—  
  The suffering beauty of the earth—  
  And how I pray in my heart, that I am in the world  
  And can share this day.  


- Edna St Vincent Millay
