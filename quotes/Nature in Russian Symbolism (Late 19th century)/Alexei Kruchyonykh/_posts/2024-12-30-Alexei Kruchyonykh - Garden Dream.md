Garden Dream
In the garden where wildflowers bloom,
Nature enfolds me in her fragrant loom.
Petals unfurl like whispers of fate,
In this sanctuary, I patiently wait.

Bumblebees dance with a buzz in the air,
Each moment a treasure, precious and rare.
In the brush of soft petals, I find my way,
In the heart of the garden, I long to stay.

- Alexei Kruchyonykh
