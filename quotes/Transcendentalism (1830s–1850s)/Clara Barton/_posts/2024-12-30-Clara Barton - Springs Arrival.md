Spring’s Arrival

The flowers push through thawing ground,
Awakening with life anew;
In every petal, joy is found,
A dance of colors, bright and true.

With gentle rains and warming sun,
Nature sings the springtime’s song;
In the cycle of seasons, each one,
Is a reminder that we all belong.

- Clara Barton
