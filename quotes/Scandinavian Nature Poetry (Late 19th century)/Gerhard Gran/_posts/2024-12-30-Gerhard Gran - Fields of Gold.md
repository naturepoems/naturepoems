In fields of gold where dreams arise,
With every turn, the past enlightens,
The sunflowers reach for open skies,
Their faces bright as daylight brightens.

In each petal, stories lie,
Of summer's kiss, of laughter shared,
In every bloom, a soft goodbye,
As seasons change, as hearts are bared.

- Gerhard Gran
