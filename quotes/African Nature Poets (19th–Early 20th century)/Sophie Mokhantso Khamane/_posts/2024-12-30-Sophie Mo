Glimpse of the Night Sky

As shadows deepen, darkness draws,
The night awakens with its silent paws,
Stars flicker, like whispers of light,
In the vast universe, pure delight.

The moon rises, a silver glance,
Casting magic, inviting us to dance,
Each constellation a tale to share,
In the tapestry of night, treasures rare.

The soft breeze carries stories untold,
Of lovers and dreamers, both young and old,
In nature’s embrace, we find our space,
Under the night sky, love finds grace.

So let your heart wander, let it fly,
In the glimpse of the night, you will find why,
For in each star, a wish does reside,
In the vastness of night, dreams abide.
