In the Mountains
The mountains lift their heads so high,  
       They touch the clouds with snow;  
Beneath their peaks, the valleys sigh,  
       With rivers that gently flow.

The pine trees stand so strong and proud,  
       They whisper to the brook;  
In quiet woods, the night is loud,  
       A song from nature's book.

The stars at night, they twinkle bright,  
       As if they know the way;  
In the mountains, dreams take flight,  
       To greet the coming day.




- Robert Louis Stevenson
