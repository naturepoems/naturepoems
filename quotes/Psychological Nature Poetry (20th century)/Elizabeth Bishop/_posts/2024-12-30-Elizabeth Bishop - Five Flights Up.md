Five Flights Up

There’s snow all year in that place,
it rains all year,
the fog obscures
the hills like a ghost; 
the shore has a bloodied waste,
a life full enough
of emptiness and grace,
some cold comprehension of birth
full of blades and breakage
in that mercurial air.

Still, there’s always that one
brooding stone that refuses
all excitement,
yet can still entice.
