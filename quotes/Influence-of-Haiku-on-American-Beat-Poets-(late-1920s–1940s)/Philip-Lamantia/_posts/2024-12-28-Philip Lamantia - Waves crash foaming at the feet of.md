The ocean sings a forgotten song,  
While seagulls chart their erratic paths,  
And the salty air carries whispers,  
Of journeys taken and destinies lost."

Waves crash, foaming at the feet of rocks,  
The ocean sings a forgotten song,  
While seagulls chart their erratic paths,  
And the salty air carries whispers,  
Of journeys taken and destinies lost.
