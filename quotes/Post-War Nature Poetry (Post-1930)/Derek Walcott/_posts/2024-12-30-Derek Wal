The Whispering Wind

How softly shall I hear the whispers,
Of the wind through the waving trees,
Carrying messages from the mountains,
Tracing paths along the shores of thoughts?
In this quietude, I find reflections of the day,
Where sunsets bleed into music,
And shadows dance in the coolness of dusk.
Each breath I take is a communion,
With the earth, the sky, the starry night,
An embrace of peace, of promise,
For tomorrow, when the wind returns,
I shall listen more closely,
With an open heart to its secrets.

- Derek Walcott
