The Stream's Secret

I
  A brook flows softly, silvery pale,
     Resounding through the lonely vale,
     With vibrant echoes murmuring round,
     In natureâ€™s voice, it bids me sound.

II
  Here wind-flowers and violets grow,
     Sweet light but just bestows its glow;
     In dreamy echoes far and wide,
     The stream let loose, I shall abide.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
