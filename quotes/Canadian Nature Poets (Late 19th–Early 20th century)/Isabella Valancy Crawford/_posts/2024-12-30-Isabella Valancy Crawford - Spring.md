Spring

O gentle spring! Comest thou back at last,
  With thy fragrant breath and sunny cheer;
To dance upon the dead leaves of the past,
  In bloom and beauty, sweet and clear.

The birds return to build their nests anew,
  The green buds break in joy and mirth;
With joyous laughter, like the morning dew,
  You bring forth life to lull the earth.

- Isabella Valancy Crawford
