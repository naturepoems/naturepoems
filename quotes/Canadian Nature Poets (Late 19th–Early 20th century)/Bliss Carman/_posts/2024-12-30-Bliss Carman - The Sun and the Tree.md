THE SUN AND THE TREE

Treetop, where the long green shines  
With thick, green, glowing vines,  
The Sun is out to see  
Wherein the shining sea.

Through many a bending bough  
He looked to see what now  
The flowers would always do  
In the rains and also dew.

And all that flower blooms,  
Richly with scented plumes;  
From the dew-rich glade to the pines  
The sun, on his journey, shines.
