in Just- 
   spring when the world is mud- 
   luscious the little 
   lame balloonman 
   whistles 
   far    and wee 
   and eddieandbill 
   come running from 
   marbles and 
   piracies 
   and it’s
   spring 
   when the world is 
   mud-luscious
   and 
   the little 
   lame balloonman 
   whistles 
   far
   and
   wee

- E E Cummings
