The Gipsy

After the sunset's glowing plight,
By the road where shades grow slight,
An evening wind rode through the trees,
And the laughter danced upon the breeze.

The gipsy paid no heed to me,
With laughter wild she wandered free,
And I beheld in her bright eyes,
The spirit of all hidden skies.


- Samuel Taylor Coleridge
