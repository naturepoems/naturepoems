The force that through the green fuse drives the flower
Drives my green age; that blasts the roots of trees
Is my thoughtsâ€™ the sap that rises in me
And its root goes down

And leads me to the grave.

The glassy creek, the dancing trees,
The force that through the green fuse drives the flower
Is the target of the mind of man
Who measures all that is,

In sacred numbers, and a twinkling star.

- Dylan Thomas
