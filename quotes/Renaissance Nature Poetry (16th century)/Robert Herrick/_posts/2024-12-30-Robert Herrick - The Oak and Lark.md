The disdainful Oak hath grieved,
For all the echoes 'neath bequeathed;
Yet soft, the larks above do come,
And thrum the leaves, the earth of their drum.

For every shadow on the fountain laid,
Makes way for all that calls for light;
Venus, there, does press her stately shade,
And gives us love through nature's sight!

- Robert Herrick
