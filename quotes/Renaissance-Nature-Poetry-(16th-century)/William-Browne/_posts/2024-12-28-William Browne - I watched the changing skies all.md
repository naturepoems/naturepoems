I watched the changing skies all day,
The sun that shone, the clouds that fled;
Soft breezes spoke in tender play,
While natureâ€™s arms around me spread.

The world was rich, no silence there,
In every sound a symphony;
As if the earth, beyond compare,
Gave praise to all, including me.


- William Browne
