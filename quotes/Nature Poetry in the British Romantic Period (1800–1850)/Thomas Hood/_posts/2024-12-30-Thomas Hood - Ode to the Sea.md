Ode to the Sea  

O great and wondrous master deep,  
Where dreams and fancies dwell,  
Is it thou who hast made men weep,  
Or ever done so well!  

For every drop that weighs with love,  
Is sown in nature's grace;  
To see the tempest rise above,  
And calm it with thy embrace.  

Like gentle breezes take us high,  
Or fold us in thine arms,  
O sacred guardian of the sky,  
Where hope shall sing by charms!

- Thomas Hood
