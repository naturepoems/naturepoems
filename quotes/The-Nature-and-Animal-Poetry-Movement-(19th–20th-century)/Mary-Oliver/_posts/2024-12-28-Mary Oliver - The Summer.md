The Summer Day
Who made the world?
Who made the swan, and the black bear?
Who made the grasshopper?
This grasshopper, I mean—the one who has flung herself
out of the grass, the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,
who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.
Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.
Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.
I don’t know exactly what a prayer is.
I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down
into the grass, how to kneel in the grass,
how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,
how to look and listen, how to walk in the rain.
Now, I will do nothing but listen,
in the grass, at the end of the world.
I don’t know what I should do with this life
but I know this—
it is good to be alive.

- Mary Oliver
