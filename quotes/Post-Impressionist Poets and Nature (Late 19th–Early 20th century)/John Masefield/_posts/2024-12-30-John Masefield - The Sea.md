The Sea

I am the captain of my soul;
I am the Master of my craft;
The Sea is my only plan;
Uniting wind and waves, sails billow,
Across the great expanse,
Where the dawn lifts, and the dusk falls,
I roam the ocean's caverns deep,
Where secrets lie and shadows creep;
Over the dream, the water’s sweep,
To breathe, to live, to weave the dance, 
Upon the liquid land I prance.

- John Masefield
