To Hope
When by my solitary hearth I sit,
And brood upon the old, and happy days,
Which I have had in my sweet childhood's time,
The stories sung by nature's mortal gaze,
And how I loved them then—and on each day,
They came as life, with voices strong and bright.

To see the beauty, oh hope! care not,
Whether the world wishes it should cease:
What plant we sow, or roll as dreams undone,
Nature still rings, as peace. 


- John Keats
