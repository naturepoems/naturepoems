The Seed Dissolves

The seed dissolves before our eyes,
  as gentle vapors rise and fall;
  and often, ere we lift our sighs,
  do we lose the worlds, held bright in thralls;

The depths of woodlands whisper low,
  beneath the sweet and sable skies,
  pressed on the creeks where life must flow,
  and through green meadows as it flies.

Oh, how it dances, round and round,
  guiding to glades till twilight's sound
  of flying seeds and fallen bloom,
  drapes itself still in summer's loom!

Thus love's own whispers take us there,
  over heaven and earth’s delight;
  and press her gentle sinews bare,
  to crown the world's entire night.


- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
