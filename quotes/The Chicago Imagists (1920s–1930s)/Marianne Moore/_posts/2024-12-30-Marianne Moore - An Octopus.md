An Octopus
The octopus is a living grass,
    a thrifty one, I mean—though
    it will take all your fingers out
    indefinitely. It swims without style
    with a touch of the world unlike
    anything most of us will understand.

The air floats well there,
    high up above, its greenish clasp alone
    allows for renovation and
    a strange superstitious hold
    while it exudes oldness just as
    the bark does on the trees—

One claw of a former life seems to
    uncoil away from those who see
    from the ribs of life; it's windy
    currents, while in the other
    life sleeps, attempts a movement of cure.

If it turned back to the surface
    and behaved without them entirely,
    touches would extend outward into
    the neighbor's backyard, stretching
    endlessly in a helpless wondering.
    No thought could compare to them.

- Marianne Moore
