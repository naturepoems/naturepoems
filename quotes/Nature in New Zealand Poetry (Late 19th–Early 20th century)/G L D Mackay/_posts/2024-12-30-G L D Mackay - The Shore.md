The Shore

O fair, bright ocean, thy treasures rare,  
They dot the shore with a graceful care;  
The shells, so light, and the pearls aglow,  
Oh to dwell on thy margin, here will I go!

With the tide that ebbs and flows, anew,  
As the sands of fortune drift with the blue;  
There my heart shall sing, as the waters roll,  
In sweet serenade to my wandering soul.


- G L D Mackay
