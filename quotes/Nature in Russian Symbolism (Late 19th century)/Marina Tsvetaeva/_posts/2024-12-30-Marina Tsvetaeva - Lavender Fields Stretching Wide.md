Lavender fields stretching wide,
Where the earth coats itself in violet,
In the scent, my spirit dances,
Melding with the warm sunset.
Haunting echoes of the day,
Crickets sing a lullaby,
Each star a dream of yesterday,
In the fading light, we sigh.
Whispers of the breeze surround,
Carrying tales from far and near,
In the heart of natureâ€™s bounty,
Every song brings forth a tear.

- Marina Tsvetaeva
