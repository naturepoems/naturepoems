When I think of fall,   
of lost leaves and low skies   
my whole body bends  
toward the ground —   
it is the place of silence,  
and of gathering thoughts  
at dusk's gentle arrival.  

Each crumb on the earth  
whispers of what was beautiful,  
as the tree extends   
its branches to the moisture of gray —  
we are part   
of this giving,  
this return to the air.
