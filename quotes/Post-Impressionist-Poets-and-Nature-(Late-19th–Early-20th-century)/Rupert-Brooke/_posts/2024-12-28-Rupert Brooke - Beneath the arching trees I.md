---

Beneath the arching trees I stand,
Where the leafy branches softly sway.
In this breathing, living land,
The echoes of the past stray.

Each leaf that falls holds tales untold;
Each whispering breeze recalls the fight.
In nature’s cradle, fierce yet bold,
I wring my hands, embrace the night.


- Rupert Brooke
