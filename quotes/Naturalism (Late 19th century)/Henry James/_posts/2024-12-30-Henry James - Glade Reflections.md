At the edge of the quiet glade,
The sun dips low, the shadows fade.
A moment lingers, time stands still,
Natureâ€™s heartbeat, pure and will.

In every rustle, a voice is heard,
The whispering wind, the trilling bird.
Together they weave a sacred space,
Where every corner holds nature's grace.


- Henry James
