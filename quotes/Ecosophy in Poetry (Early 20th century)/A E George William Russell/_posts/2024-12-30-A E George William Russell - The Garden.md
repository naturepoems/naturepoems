The Garden

In the garden where I wander,  
Among the flowers bright and fair,  
I find the beauty of the heavens  
Dancing softly in the air.  
Each bloom sings of love and laughter,  
Each petal holds a dream so near,  
And the spirit of the garden  
Brings a joy thatâ€™s always clear.

- A E George William Russell
