The wind was a silent wonder,
In the twilight’s suffocated dim;
With a soft shimmer on the water,
As night descended, whispers swim.
The trees that bore the weight of day,
Now swayed gently in twilight's glow.
Each rustling leaf, a hymn to say,
In nature’s arms, our troubles go.
For in the heart of evening’s peace,
With every glance, the world ignites,
In gentle tune, our souls release,
As stars unfurl their nightly lights.


- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
