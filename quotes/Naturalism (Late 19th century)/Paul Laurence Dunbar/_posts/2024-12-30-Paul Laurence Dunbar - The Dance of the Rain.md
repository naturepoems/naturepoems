How gentle falls the rain today,  
Upon the earth in soft array.  
The puddles form, the rivers swell,  
And nature sings its liquid spell.  

Each drop a joy, a song, a dance,  
Awakens life, gives it a chance.  
And when the clouds at last depart,  
The sunâ€™s bright rays will warm the heart.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
