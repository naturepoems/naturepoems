Chasing Shadows

Through the glade we wander,
     Where shadows weave and play,
     The dance of light and darkness,
     Envelops all the day;
     With every step we venture,
     Into realms of soft delight,
     In nature's quiet presence,
     We glimpse the purest light.

- William D A S Muir
