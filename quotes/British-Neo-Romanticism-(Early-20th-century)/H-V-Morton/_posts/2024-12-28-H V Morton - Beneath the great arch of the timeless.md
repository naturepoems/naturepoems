Beneath the great arch of the timeless blue sea,
In the roar of the waves, hear the spirits run free.
Where the gulls sail on currents, in laughter they glide,
In the heart of the ocean, our dreams coincide.

The warmth of the sand, like a lover's embrace,
Soft whispers of shells tell of journeys in grace.
With each ebb and flow, the tides rise and fall,
In nature's great rhythm, we heed the call.

The sun bids farewell with a burst of red fire,
In the canvas of twilight, our hearts lift ever higher.
For the dance of the heavens in evening's soft sigh,
Reminds us of beauty that never shall die.

So gather the moments, like treasures you find,
In the realms of the wild, let your spirit unwind.
For in nature's sweet bounty, the soul finds its way,
In the eloquent silence, we welcome the day.

- H V Morton
