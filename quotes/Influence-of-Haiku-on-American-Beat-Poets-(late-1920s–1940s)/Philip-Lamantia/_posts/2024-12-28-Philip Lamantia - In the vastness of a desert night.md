quote: "In the vastness of a desert night,  
Stars pulse like distant thoughts,  
The silence hums with ancient echoes,  
While a lone cactus stands guard,  
A sentinel of time and space."

In the vastness of a desert night,  
Stars pulse like distant thoughts,  
The silence hums with ancient echoes,  
While a lone cactus stands guard,  
A sentinel of time and space.
