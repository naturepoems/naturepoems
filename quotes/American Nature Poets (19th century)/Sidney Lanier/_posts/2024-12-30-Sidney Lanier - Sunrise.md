Sunrise

The dawn unveils her title, fair and bright,  
As slats of gold divide the night,
And all the eddies of the sun,
Tempestuous and warm, released their run.

Soft as the hushed whispers of the ground,
Life bursts to greet the love profound  
Of Nature's arms enfolding me,
In this sacred moment, tender and free.
â€”Sidney Lanier
