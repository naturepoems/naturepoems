ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF A YOUNG MAN

A lad of the Shires that is come to his own;  
As springtime, so short, is the season for wane—  
But long be his buried thistle blown,  
When spring is no more to the flower, nor scene.

Bring a pitcher of dreams, I will pour out the dew,  
For the hearts of the lost are unyielding but kind;  
Let the earth that you left have a glimpse of you,  
And the trees that mourn shall remember behind.  


- A E Housman
