Oh, how the leaves laugh in the golden glow!
With every sway, the earth starts to flow,
Swaying low beside the shimmering stream,
Where butterflies flutter as if in a dream.
Under the branches that dance in the dusk,
I breathe the calm scents—sweet life in its musk.
Nature whispers gently in the tranquil night,
Filling my heart with a warm, pure delight.

- Arthur Rimbaud
