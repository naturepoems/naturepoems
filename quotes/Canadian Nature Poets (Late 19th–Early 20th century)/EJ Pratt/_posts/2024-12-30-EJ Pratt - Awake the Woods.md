Awake, the Woods  
  
  
Awake, the woods, the woods!  
The silent whisper of the trees  
Caught in the velvet green embrace  
Of summer's end; and hear the song  
The robins sing in twilight's breeze.  
  
The azure sky their staging bright,  
With sunlight filtered through the leaves,  
Soft murmurs in the foliage green  
Of nature shaking free her dreams.
  
And every bough, like finger's touch,  
Calls forth the glistening dew of morn.  
Awake, the woods! For there is mirth  
In every rustle, every form!

- EJ Pratt
