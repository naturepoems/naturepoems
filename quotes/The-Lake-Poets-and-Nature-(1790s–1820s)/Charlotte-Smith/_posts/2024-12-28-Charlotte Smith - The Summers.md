The Summer's Night

Too much of joy is rare, the summer's night
Spread o'er the sea, the stars a dazzling sight.
The gusty breeze that plays among the trees,
Carries a perfume that the heart can seize.

Oh send thy whispers through the silent air,
And when thou dost retire, tell me where!

— Charlotte Smith
