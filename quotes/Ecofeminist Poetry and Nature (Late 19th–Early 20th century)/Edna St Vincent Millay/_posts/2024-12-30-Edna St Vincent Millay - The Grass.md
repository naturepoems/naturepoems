THE GRASS

The grass grows tall, and winds the day,
   With fingers stretching wide,
Where sunshine lingers long around,
   And shadows never hide.

With silks of green and blossoms fair,
   As seasons rise and fade,
A lush delight shall fill the air,
   And sunlight plays the shade.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
