Morning in the Woods

Awake to the sun, bright and golden,
As it stretches its light over dappled land,
The world is alive, a promise unbroken,
With beauty and wonder close at hand.

Birds greet the day with a jubilant song,
As I walk the path, where whispers of leaves,
Tell tales of the night, where dreams belong,
In natureâ€™s embrace, my spirit receives.

So let me wander in the morning light,
And soak in the splendor of all I behold,
For in this moment, everything feels right,
In the heart of the woods, life is told.

- John Burroughs
