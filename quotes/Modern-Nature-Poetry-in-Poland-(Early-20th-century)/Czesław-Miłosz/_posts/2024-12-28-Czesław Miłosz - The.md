The Spring

The earth awakens,
breathes a sigh of relief,
as green pushes through,
life returns with vigor.

The flowers bloom,
like laughter,
breaking the silence of winter,
covering the ground,
below a sky that turns blue.

And in this moment,
I feel the pulse of the world,
quickening my own heart,
reminding me to live,
to be part of creation.


- Czesław Miłosz
