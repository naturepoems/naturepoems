To a Flower

Thou wondrous bud of nature's art,  
So sweetly wrought in silken hues;  
An agile joy that takes my heart  
And wakes the soul, its shades to choose.

When in the garden, there thou art,  
Thy beauty whispers, soft and clear;  
What secrets dost thou desire to part  
With all who wander near to hear.

I bow before thy priceless grace,  
As dreams arise like sways of time;  
A gentle touch, thy light embrace,  
Entwines my spirit with thy rhyme.

- John Davies
