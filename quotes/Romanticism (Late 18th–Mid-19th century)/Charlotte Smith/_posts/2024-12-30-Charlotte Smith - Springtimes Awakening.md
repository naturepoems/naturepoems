When springtime clad the ground in emerald grace,  
And blossoms danced in joy beneath the sun,  
A world reborn, where sorrow finds no place,  
Where laughter echoes bright, and hope’s begun.  

With every bud, a promise to unfold,  
A tale of love, in petals soft and sweet;  
In Nature’s hand, a story yet untold,  
As life returns, unyielding, to the beat.

- Charlotte Smith
