I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,
Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,
The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,
The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work;

The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat,
The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench—
The hatter singing as he stands;

Ay, the delightful voices of the singers,
The strong, free and wild hymns of the soul,
Of all that the river and the sky, and the forests contain,
To write it, to sing it, to feel it in each heart's pulse,

For everything, even the smallest leaf,
Illustrates the majesty of the whole.

— From "Leaves of Grass"

- Walt Whitman
