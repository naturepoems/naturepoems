Under a wide heaven, the wildflowers bloom,
Where crickets are singing and sunflowers loom.
The river winds whispering through valleys and glades,
Where shadows of trees and the sunâ€™s bright cascades.

The landscape stretches out in a marveling smile,
And seasons weave magic through each verdant mile.
With every oak and every fern, nature stands to unfold,
Her secrets in whispers and stories untold.


- Willa Cather
