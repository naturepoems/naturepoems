Upon the hill where shadows rest,
 The quiet earth with peace is blessed.
 The brooklet’s laugh, the rustling leaves,
 In moments still, the spirit weaves.

 The dawn unveils her silver hue,
 Each flower wakes to greet the dew.
 A tranquil heart, a ceaseless mind,
 When nature calls, true joy we find.


- Roger Fry
