Frosted Twilight
The winter twilight brings a chill,
As frost enchants the sleeping ground;
With crystal lace, the air will fill,
And silence spreads its snowy sound.

In this cocoon of white and gray,
A promise of warm spring awaits;
For every end, there comes a day,
When life will bloom and love elates.

- Ilya Ehrenburg
