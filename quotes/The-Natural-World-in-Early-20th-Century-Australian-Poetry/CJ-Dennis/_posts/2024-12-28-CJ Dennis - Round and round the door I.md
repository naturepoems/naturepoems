Round and round the door I go,
As I buzz, I buzz, I buzz,
And the folks inside the screen, you know,
Are calling out to me, because
They cringe and flinch,
They bow and flinch,
Yet, time and time again
I whip and whisk and with a pinch
I flee, and fly, and buzz again.

Now and then I settle down
On a clapboard of the door,
Right upon the window's crown,
(What a moment for to soar!),
And they squawk and sway
And squeal and play,
But never a treat for me,
And I twist and wriggle all the day
To hear those folks shout out with glee.
