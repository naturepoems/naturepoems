Song of Myself

I am large, I contain multitudes.

And the grass is all a part of 
Our beginnings, just as it stretches long in the sun.

The smell of the earth when it rains,
The fresh air with the breezes fluttering
The sound of birds in the trees,
All of this—to me—is You, is us.


- Walt Whitman
