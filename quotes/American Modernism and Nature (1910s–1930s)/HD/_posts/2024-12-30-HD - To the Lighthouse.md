To the Lighthouse

   The damp air wells,
     in the fading dusk
      lies but chant of green.
 The garden dead
   with the drooping grasses,
    one knows the song of crystal cups.

  And what is this sleepiness—
    leading to roses,
mysignant steps,
 my heart swells with flowers,
   that blossom beneath their sigh.
   —H.D.
