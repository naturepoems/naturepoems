A Prayer of the Woods

O let me dwell among the trees,
In sacred silence, soft and still;

Where every breath of evâ€™ning breeze
Shall whisper love on every hill.

I long to hear the songbirds sing,
Together praise to earth and sky;

As nature's hands begin to bring
This sweet communion, warm and high.


- Philip Freneau
