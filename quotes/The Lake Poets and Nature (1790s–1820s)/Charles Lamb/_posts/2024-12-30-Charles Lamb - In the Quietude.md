In the Quietude

In tranquil woods, where shadows lie,
I wander with a gentle sigh,
Among the trees that whisper low,
In every footstep, quiet grows.

The birds break forth in morning song,
While sunbeams thread where leaves belong,
Soft echoes of our whispered dreams,
Entwined in Nature's sacred schemes.

Oh, give me peace, where silence reigns,
In wildest heart, away from pains,
Where every leaf that sways, does say,
Life’s sacred breath guides every day.
