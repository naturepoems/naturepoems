The Snow Man

One must have a mind of winter
To regard the frost and the boughs
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;
And have been cold a long time
To behold the junipers shagged with ice,
The spruces rough in the distant glitter
Of the January sun; and not to think
Of any misery in the sound of the wind,
That is the sound of the land full of the same
Wintering mind, that is, the sound of the wind
That is really the sound of cold, 
That is the sound of the land full of the same
Cold, in the boughs.
