For every brook that frolics,  
In laughter soft and sweet,  
There’s a mountain that rises,  
With its head held high and neat.  
 
The clouds are the thoughts of the wanderer’s mind,  
Drifting slowly through the blue;  
While the sun paints shadows, with golden light,  
And brings the day anew.

- Rudyard Kipling
