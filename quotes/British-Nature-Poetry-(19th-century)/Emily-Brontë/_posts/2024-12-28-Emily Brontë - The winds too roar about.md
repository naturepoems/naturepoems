---

The winds too roar about me;
They sing my spirit free,
Yet, as they break and scour me,
They draw me forth to sea.

To clouds and skies, I’ll wander,
No anchor holds me fast;
The waves enfold my sorrow,
The heart must see its past.

In every curl of ocean
And every pulse of time,
Let thee behold this morning,
For nature’s tastes the prime.


- Emily Brontë
