The river flows, a silver thread,  
Through meadows wide, where willows weep,  
A journey taken, softly led,  
Through valleys deep and mountains steep.  

Each ripple tells a story grown,  
In waters fresh, or tempests churned,  
The rich tapestry is sown,  
In every bend, a lesson learned.

- William Ellery Channing
