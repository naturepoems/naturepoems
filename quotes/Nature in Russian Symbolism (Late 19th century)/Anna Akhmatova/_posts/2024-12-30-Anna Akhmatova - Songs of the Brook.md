On the edge of a brook where the wildflowers sway,
I find deeper meanings in hues of the earth,
Colors collide in a dance of delight,
Natureâ€™s vibrancy speaks of rebirth.

In the chorus of crickets and rustling leaves,
I hear the secrets the forest has sworn,
Each moment a treasure, each breath a gift,
In the timeless embrace of the dawn.


- Anna Akhmatova
