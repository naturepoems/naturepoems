quote: "Stone by stone, the mountain stands—
a sentinel of time and history.
Moss clings lovingly to its face,
a tapestry of greens,
whispers of the ancients in every crevice,
a presence that humbles the heart."

Stone by stone, the mountain stands—
a sentinel of time and history.
Moss clings lovingly to its face,
a tapestry of greens,
whispers of the ancients in every crevice,
a presence that humbles the heart.
