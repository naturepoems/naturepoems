In twilight's glow, the skies transform,
The world settles in a quiet form.
Crickets chirp their evening songs,
As nature peacefully rights the wrongs.

The moon rises high, a silvery trail,
Illuminating all that’s frail.
In this moment, shadows fade,
And the heart finds peace unafraid.

Oh, how I long for this delight,
In nature's fold, I lose my fright.
In sacred silence, my soul will soar,
For in these moments, I crave for more.


- Juliusz Słowacki
