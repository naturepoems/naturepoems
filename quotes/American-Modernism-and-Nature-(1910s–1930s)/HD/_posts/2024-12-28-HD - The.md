The Garden

(For Sigmund Freud)

The house of the skies  
touched its wind  
on the tree about my neck,  
as the sun drops down,  
as the flowers drop down.  

Like a star crossed native  
with brilliant leaves  
I question within:
Is this dream of doves  
your bright flower?
Is this strayed  
voyage on the land,  
a passage I echo from the central sun?
Or,  
do you reach a green bow,  
until darkness makes its move;
almost unharmed,  
we bring about the tamed branches.

Can I measure this spring  
by cascading about the quiver?  
Shadowed by sound,  
stilled by shores of angel hearts  
find the equinox of me!
