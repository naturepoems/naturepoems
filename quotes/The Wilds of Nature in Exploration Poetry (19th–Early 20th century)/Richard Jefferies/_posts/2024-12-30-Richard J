The sun is up—no more delay:
The flowers awake, all in array;
Each petal holds a universe—
The skies pour light, the days disperse.

Come forth! O child of Nature's hand,
Embrace the earth, the golden sand;
Let wanderlust and joy be sown,
Amongst the wilds where life hath grown.

Each babbling brook shall be your guide,
The whispering leaves your knotty pride;
In every grain of soil rest hope—
In Nature's arms, forever cope.

- Richard Jefferies
