The beauty of dawn spills across the sky,
Golden rays usher in the new day,
With each breath, the world awakens in grace,
As the darkness of night gently fades away.

The promise of morning, soft and serene,
Wraps the earth in its warm, tender cloak,
And in this moment, all worries subside,
In the embrace of nature, kindness awoke.


- Anna Akhmatova
