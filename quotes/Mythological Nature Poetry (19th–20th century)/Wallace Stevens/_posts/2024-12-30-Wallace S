The Snow Man

One must have a mind of winter
To regard the frost and the boughs
Of the pines that are frozen along the house

In the great spruces, and the pines, and
The surges of the snow,
To regard the snow and the trees
And to know them as themselves,

To behold in the moment of the winter.

For the man is vast and the snow is vast,
The moment is vast but the dead men are dead.

But when you regard the frost on the pines
You regard only the frost.
You must have a mind of winter.

The Journey of the Magi

A cold coming we had of it,
Just the worst time of the year
For a journey, and such a long journey:
The ways deep and the weather sharp,
The very dead of winter.

There were times we regretted
The summer palaces on the slopes,
The chambers of the sky,
In the dead of winter.

But is so, we were quite uncertain
But there came a shining star,
We heard the throes of life,
In the eternal night, snowfall.

Disillusionment of Ten O'Clock

The houses are haunted
By the big trees,
The slightest glow moonlight,
Each in their own,
As dreams keep dancing
On their purest.

Ghostly dreams,
People;
But they are safe
Because they are lost,
In their brushes of time.

Of Mere Being

The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of other states,
Its statement is no more than
A palm’s simple behaviour.

The palm stands on the edge of space
Under the sun, in the chaos of the air,
And the palm’s simple behaviour
Is the beginning of all.

The palm ends in a stillness,
An ending profound with folds of air;
In its essence, a mere being emerges,
With the dynamics of mundane life.

Sunday Morning

Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her.
This is the beginning of the day,
On a Sunday morning, in the season of blossoms,
As the sunlight retreats and spaces dissolve
Between moments of existence and fading mysteries.

I would be among the flowers,
And sing of the sweetness of longing,
Amid the soft warmth of the sun,
In joy unconfined!

What we must think and how we must act
On a Sunday morning like this,
Is the essence arising and passing away
In beauty, in death, and purposefulness.

Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction

Perhaps the world is round,
To see the stars all day, to see
The bright stars at night, above,
To feel the shadows and the great distances,
The ways of the universe, and the birds
And the colours sought in the birds,
The notes of green.

Anecdote of the Jar

I placed a jar in Tennessee,
And round it was, upon a hill.
It made the slovenly wilderness
Surround that hill.

The wilderness rose up to it,
And sprawled around, no longer wild.
The jar was round upon the ground
And tall and of a port in air.

It took dominion everywhere.
The jar was gray and bare.
It did not give of bird or bush
Like nothing else in Tennessee.

The Idea of Order at Key West

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind
Of coral, or a constellation
Rising like the sea of day.

For her the sea was merely that,
Smooth and serrated,
A mirror clouding over and overtaking
The human thoughts that shaped and warmed,
Or the swimming brains of its anguish,

And still, the sea rolled on and changed,
And thus arises in the air;
In place of resolution, beauty and confusion
Still, sailing across that night.

Tea and Poetry

Winter is a light rain, savoring solitude,
Under the skin, and so the stillness,
Of what is to come, upon mindful fields—
In the translucent touch of time,
The rusted silence, creeps across.

In time, one will class and revisit
Voyages under realms of tea and poetry,
In one moment of leaf-peeled drinks,
To bathe in the elegy of nature.

An Ordinary Evening in New Haven

It is difficult to find the flicker
Of the leaf in the wind,
The pathways murmur through the blare—
The shuffling evenings in soot and echo
Made blunt geometries in fog.

Yet still the mystery remains
In the ghosts of life and sorrowed leaves,
An ordinary evening made thin
In the browning shadows dancing afar,
Yet there resides a gleaming light.

The Emperor of Ice-Cream

Call the roller of big cigars,
The muscular one, and let the bearded one
Beheeled with cinnamon and citrus,
The one who comes for comfort, allured
By the sweet summer and the oranges.

Let us serve up ice in those columns,
And frost their ways, blur the shapes,
Beyond the cracks of this world.

The Snow Man (Repetition)

One must have a mind of winter
To regard the frost and the boughs
Of the frozen trees in speeches,
And thus the old blue sky,

Makes distance down the hollow field.
The field of snow is endless,
And in such moments one knows
That arrangement brings beauty close.
