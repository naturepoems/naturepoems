Ode to Melancholy

No, no! go not to Lethe, neither twist
Wolf’s-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;
Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss’d
ByNightshade, and nor couldst thou pine—

Tell me, oh Melancholy, why surely I do sigh?
In vain am I to know the cries and sweet little things,
That mash and hug about my heart, and wings?

An echo hung on in stillness—rose in twain
Fifth-songs still gild the soul with memories dear.
And how my heart, still throbbing, ne’er forgets
The sorrow that’s unmade, an agony of years.

For wherefore dost thou stand beside the gloom,
To slow the footsteps of the day in pastel hues,
For attempts that nature makes to ever kiss the damp earth,
In softest gratitude with roses and dew?


- John Keats
