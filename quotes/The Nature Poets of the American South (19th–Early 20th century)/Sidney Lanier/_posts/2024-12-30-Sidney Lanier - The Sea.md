The Sea
The rolling waves greet the shore in splendor,
  With powerful caresses deep;
Their currents wrap-time, gentle, tender—
  Where dreams to soul’s promise leap.

Come see the beauty speak in sound,
  As the twilight draws its veil,
The whispering breezes hug the ground,
  And in hushed majesty, exhale.

- Sidney Lanier
