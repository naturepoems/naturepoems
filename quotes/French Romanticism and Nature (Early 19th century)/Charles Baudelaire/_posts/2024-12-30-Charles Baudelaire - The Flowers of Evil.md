The Flowers of Evil

In my garden of dreams, unplucked blooms,  
Foul and fragrant, arise from somber tombs;  
Where shadows blend with choices dark,  
Yet every petal sings its lark.

The violet shall weep, the rose shall dance,  
Each grotesque blossom in a stolen glance;  
Gushing rivulets of desperate red,  
Where angels cry and the poets tread.

Embrace the drear to find the light,  
In cursed withering lies hidden delight;  
Thus natureâ€™s duality plays its part  
In the deepest recesses of the heart.

- Charles Baudelaire
