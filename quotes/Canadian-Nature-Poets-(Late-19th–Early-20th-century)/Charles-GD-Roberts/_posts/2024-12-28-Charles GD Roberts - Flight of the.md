Flight of the Heron

The heron seeks the waters deep,
To wade among the shadows steep,
With every grace, it glides along,
A phantom, silent, cool, and strong.
  
It pierces through the mirrored lake,
And bends the reeds and ripples make;
A vision cast in tender light,
It dances in the dusk of night.
  
O noble bird, with patience taught,
In questing journeys fiercely sought,
You teach me stillness, patience too,
In nature’s dance, the heart is true.


- Charles GD Roberts
