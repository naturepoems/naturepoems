An Ordinary Evening in New Haven

All the colors fall from the sky —
As time slips within the shimmering pulse.
The ordinary soft measures draw
A deep round from the mysteries of light,
The air is fair and the sound of trees,
Murmuring song beneath their branches,
Is the essence of stillness gracing the evening,
When twilight haunts and awakens the quiet home—
The trees twist gently nearer and nearer,
In the deep the air almost glows,
Full of the breathing thoughts of life.
— Wallace Stevens
