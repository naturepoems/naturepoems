To the River Charles

River of the West, thy friendly tide
loves best the green banks we wear with rise,
Within the shoals; all that we seek confide,
Hope to the flow which knows both moods and tries.

If I should drink too long upon thy shore,
Where hills are swathed in fading purple light,
And dare once more, through shivering spray and roar,
Be cast away in day and sleep in night,

Here let me linger, on thy quiet way,
As summer wanes; thy shores of tense delight,
With beauty faltered fade along the day,
As melting stars give forth a silent sight.

Where double shadows gather fast and free,
And leaden leaves lie round, thrown oâ€™er the sea,
Yet will I come, well hallowed in thy care,
Until I meet the stars, forever there!

- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr
