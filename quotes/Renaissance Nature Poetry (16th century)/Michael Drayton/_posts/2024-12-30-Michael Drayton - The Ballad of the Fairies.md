The Ballad of the Fairies
Come hither, all ye fairy elf,
A merry bunch shall stand,
And we will dance till morning light,
Around this verdant land.

O’r hills, o’r dales, o’r sylvan shade,
Let sound of laughter ring,
For in this circle, joy we’ll make,
In the joy of spring.

With flowers in our dainty hats,
And jewels on our toes,
We’ll caper high and dance away,
In this bright land that glows.

Where streams do play and lilies sway,
We’ll crown our legs with green,
And march about the forest wood,
As merry as we’ve been.

The dew will sparkle gleaming fair,
Upon the leaf and bloom,
And while the stars do wink and glow,
We’ll dally till the moon.


- Michael Drayton
