The sun was warm upon my back
as I lay in the grass and looked up.
I could see the blue sky, the white clouds,
and the boughs of trees.

The air was fragrant with the scent
of blossoming flowers.
I felt a great peace come over me,
a feeling that was past all understanding.

- William Carlos Williams
