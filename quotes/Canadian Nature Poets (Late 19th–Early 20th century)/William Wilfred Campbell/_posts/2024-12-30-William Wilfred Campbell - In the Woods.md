In the Woods

In the woods, my heart is light—
  The evening sun doth rest,
  And dreams of purple shadows glide,
  Where bonnie birds are blessed.

The brook sings low beneath the boughs,
  And twilight weaves her veil,
  To hush each troubled thought as though
  It slept within the vale.

The lily smiles upon the pond,
  The whispering winds are sweet,
  And every flower in its own world
  Is perfect at my feet.

Oh, nature, secret, wild and free,
  Thy beauty ever shows
  The love that speaks us softly back,
  Ever sweet with the rose.

- William Wilfred Campbell
