Fields of gold and fields of green,
   Come alive with the sun's caress,
   Rolling hills that steal the heart,
   Awaken dreams in gentle dress.

   A cottage nestled, by the stream,
   Bursting forth in life and song,
   Every flower bowing low,
   Whispering that we all belong.

   Each leaf a testament to spring,
   Each drop of dew a promise made,
   Nature’s hand encompasses all,
   In beauty, never to fade.

- T E Lawrence
