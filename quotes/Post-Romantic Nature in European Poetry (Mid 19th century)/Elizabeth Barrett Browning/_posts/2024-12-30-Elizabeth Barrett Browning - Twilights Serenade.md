In twilight’s glow, beneath the trees,
The hush of evening softly calls,
As silken threads of dusky breeze,
In fragrant scents and natural thralls.
The fireflies twinkle, distant stars,
In pathways where the crickets play,
Each note of life, in perfect bars,
Invites the dark to dance and sway.
For every shadow hides a dream,
Each night enfolds a tender grace.
In nature’s womb, all flows as stream,
Creating beauty in this space.


- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
