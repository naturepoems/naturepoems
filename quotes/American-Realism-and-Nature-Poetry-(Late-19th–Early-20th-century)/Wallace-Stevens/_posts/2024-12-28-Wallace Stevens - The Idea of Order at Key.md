The Idea of Order at Key West

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind
Of man or woman.  Nature was mostly
An operation; the sea’s voice a mere
Body, a habit to enjoy.
In the age of man, a hymn to how
to remember, she sang beyond.

The woman and the sea did not think
The sea was the spirit of anything
But as the sonorous sky’s great idea:
To be within the single sound,
The utterance of the lyric sound
Of the sea, carried across the surface,
Wherein the waters solitude resided.

The sea, a view of nowhere, existed
For her to sing, while the waves
Churned infinite in their beauty:
The voice of the sea was nothing
But the melody she adored,
As if she’d come to call home anything
That took her spirit.  How her song captured
The sea and the sea’s image:
All that surviving, and as her voice
To the border of getting the sea
Inside her, she took the sea and
Sang on as only a woman might.


- Wallace Stevens
