The Fish

I caught a tremendous fish
and held him beside the boat
half out of water, with my hook
cast in the corner of his mouth.

He didn’t reply,
which is what I thought
another fish would do,
if it had not been
anguish another one would suffer my
sorrow.

Instead I held him half out of water
and understood,
the fish flew into the current
and into the dark.
