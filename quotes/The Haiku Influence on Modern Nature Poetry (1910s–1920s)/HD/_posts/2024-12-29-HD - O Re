O read my heart,
And see what it is,
This white flower that grows. 
-- in the darkness, 
Lord, you know this:
A flower grows in darkness 
If above such things 
As mountains roll.


O me, my heart—
This mountain makes me glad, 
Makes me very sad, 
This deep dull mountain’s;
I will not go away,
—But I will linger here, 
Musing lone things in this place.

This shaking within me makes me weep.
Let the grey moss hang upon my skin,
Let green shallies breathe their deathly hold
Upon the mountain’s face.
