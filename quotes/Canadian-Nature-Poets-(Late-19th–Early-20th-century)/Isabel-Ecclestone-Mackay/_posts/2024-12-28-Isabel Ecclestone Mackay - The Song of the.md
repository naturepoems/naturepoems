The Song of the Sea

Oh, let me sing of the sea!  
Her soft-sweet waves that, day by day,  
Sing on with never a homeward cry,  
And slide away and away!  

Oh, let me sing of the sea—  
Her wildest laughter, the heart's delight—  
Her moody magic that can enfold  
The silent sun in the moon's white light.  

Oh, let me sing of the sea!  
For her, my heart is forever laid bare;  
Oh, let me gaze in her smiling face  
Till her spirit whispers, “I care.”
