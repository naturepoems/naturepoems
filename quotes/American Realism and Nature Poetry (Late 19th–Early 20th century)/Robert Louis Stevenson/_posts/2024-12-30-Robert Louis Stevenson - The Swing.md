The Swing
How do you like to go up in a swing,  
       Up in the air so blue?  
Oh! I do think it the pleasantest thing  
       Ever a child can do!

Up in the air and over the wall,  
       Till I can see so wide,  
Rivers and trees and cattle and all  
       Over the countryside—

Till I look down on the garden green,  
       Down on the roof so brown—  
Up in the air I go flying again,  
       Up in the air and down!




- Robert Louis Stevenson
