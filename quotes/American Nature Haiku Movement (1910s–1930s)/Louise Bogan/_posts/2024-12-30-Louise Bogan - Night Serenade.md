Stars scatter across the night,
Like distant thoughts sent wandering,
In the cool embrace of the moon.
The earth beneath slumbers softly,
Cradled in a lullaby of shadows,
Where dreams stretch into the void.

And the wind croons low,
Carrying the whispers of trees,
A serenade for the waking world,
Awash in silver light,
As night weaves tales of wonder.


- Louise Bogan
