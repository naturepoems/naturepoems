The Earth

The earth turns slowly,
a consequence of balance graced; lie still
and scrap takes its care,
breaks the path away
through beginnings—
you behold above
all through climbs,
like mysteries mark
wounds they left behind.

As beauty can disturb,
there are thoughts that rise
and fracture soil,
weak(x) tangle those proud thorns:
you can behold
what it means to speak.

— Marianne Moore
