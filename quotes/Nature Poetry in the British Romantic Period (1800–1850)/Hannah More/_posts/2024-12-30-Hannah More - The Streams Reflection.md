Amid the hills, a quiet stream,
Where waters run both fresh and clear,
Reflects the sky, the sun’s warm beam,
And tells of life we hold so dear.

Each pebble holds a memory,
Of days gone past and laughter shared;
So let us walk by nature's sea,
With grateful hearts, forever paired.

For in this beauty, love is found,
In every drop, in every sound;
As time does weave a tapestry,
Of moments sweet, eternally.

- Hannah More
