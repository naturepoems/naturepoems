O read me this riddle:  
Night in a strange town  
And a strange man’s face.  
A woman’s voice in the evening,  
Songs of berries and towns.  
A flower blows in the hedge.  
It is like a bell to me,  
Who am I?—  
A mystic.  
A woman’s voice, a flower,  
The moon is a cold, lost star,  
I am a cold, lost star:  
My heart aches in the deep.  
A bell, a woman’s voice—  
Who am I?
