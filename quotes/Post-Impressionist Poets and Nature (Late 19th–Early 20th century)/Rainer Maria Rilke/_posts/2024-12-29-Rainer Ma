The Sea

The green depths possess glowing eyes,
They murmur softly amid gray-edged pools,  
Whitecaps shoot in a sea-storm anew,  
While calm silkworms spin about their pearls  
Flashing visions—tears and seashells creak on sand.

Here under springs that slowly creep,  
Hearts ever demanding a steady grace,  
To trace these golden winds at evening,  
While early roots become entwined drops,  
And sea lions prosper at dawn's touch.

Oh, can you hear the sky call upon your grace?  
Endless, to sip like children under moonlight!

- Rainer Maria Rilke
