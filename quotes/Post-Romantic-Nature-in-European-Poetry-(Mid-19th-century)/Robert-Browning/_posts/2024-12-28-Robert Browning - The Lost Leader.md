The Lost Leader  
  
    Just for a handful of silver he left us,  
    Just for a ribbon to stick in his coatâ€”  
    He parted; we were not the losers;  
    The soul of nature burned bright in us;  
    The winds do carry the restless leaf away  
    With green rivers and echoing day.  


- Robert Browning
