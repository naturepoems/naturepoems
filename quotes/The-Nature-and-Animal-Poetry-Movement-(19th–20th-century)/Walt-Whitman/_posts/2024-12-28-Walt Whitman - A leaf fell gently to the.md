A leaf fell gently to the ground,
Bearing the weight of seasons,
Part of the cycle, part of the song,
In the eyes of nature, all is bound.

Sunlight dapples the forest floor,
Casting patterns of shadows and light,
In this sacred space, I find my place,
In the heart of nature's delight.

- Walt Whitman
