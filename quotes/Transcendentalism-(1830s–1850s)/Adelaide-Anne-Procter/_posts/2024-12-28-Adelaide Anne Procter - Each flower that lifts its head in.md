Each flower that lifts its head in pride,
   Each leaf that trembles in the breeze,
Each star that shines in humble guide,
   Are gifts of beauty, joy, and ease.

Oh, Nature! teach me how to see
   The love that blooms in every place;
In every shade, and every hue,
   I’ll find a glimpse of Heaven’s grace.

- Adelaide Anne Procter
