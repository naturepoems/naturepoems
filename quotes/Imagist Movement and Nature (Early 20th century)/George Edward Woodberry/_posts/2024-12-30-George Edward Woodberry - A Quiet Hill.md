A peaceful hill, where winds do wander,
And trees in quiet shadow standing,
Among the grasses wild that slumber
And in the late sun lightly landing.

Where streamlets run in silver paces,
And azure skies weigh down the air,
Here come the birds in soft embraces,
And shelter in the branches fair.

- George Edward Woodberry
