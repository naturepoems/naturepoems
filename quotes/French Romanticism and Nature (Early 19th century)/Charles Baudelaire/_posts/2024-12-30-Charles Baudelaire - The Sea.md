The Sea

The sea, eternal and wild as thought,  
Churns with a rhythm that cannot be bought;  
Born of the stars in a tempestuous womb,  
Where violence collides with unyielded gloom.

Oh! how it roars, and in madness unfurls,  
Each wave a tale, each spray a pearl;  
In its embrace lies both sorrow and bliss,  
The infinite depths of loveâ€™s abyss.

Dance in its arms, be wild and be free,  
For the heart of the ocean pounds steadfastly;  
In the chaos we find, through tempest and grace,  
The tenderness at the core of its face.

- Charles Baudelaire
