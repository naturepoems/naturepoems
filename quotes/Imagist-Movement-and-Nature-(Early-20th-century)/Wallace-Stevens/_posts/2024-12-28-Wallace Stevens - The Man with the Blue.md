The Man with the Blue Guitar
I
Everything is dying; few things are born.
Nature, the conflict of the universe
To gain is to be free again; the sky
Hidden, resembling a song.

II.
To see beyond ideas of fact and faith —
Form and color touch the interpersonal threads,
Where the sounds echo nature’s task to be
A song for the sun, a dream for those that live.

- Wallace Stevens
