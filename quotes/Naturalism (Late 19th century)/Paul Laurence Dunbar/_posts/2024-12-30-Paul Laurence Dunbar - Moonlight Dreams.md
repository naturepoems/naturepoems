Oh, silver moon, so soft and bright,  
You light the world with gentle light.  
The stars around you seem to sigh,  
As night unfolds its velvet sky.  

In tranquility, the night does breathe,  
With whispers of the heart beneath.  
And in your glow, dreams take their flight,  
Guided by your glowing light.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
