---

In the garden, I wander,
among the earth’s wrinkled canvas,
colorful blooms whisper secrets—
petals and thorns whisper together.
Each flower holds a story,
a song from the lands they sprout,
young hearts carved in sunlight,
growing wild beneath the gaze of stars.

Oh, the sweet scent of life,
that drifts through time,
a witness to our joy and pain—
this garden of endless yearning.
I kneel, I dig into the soil,
find myself again among roots
that connect all living things,
a cycle of breath, a pulse of color.


- Pablo Neruda
