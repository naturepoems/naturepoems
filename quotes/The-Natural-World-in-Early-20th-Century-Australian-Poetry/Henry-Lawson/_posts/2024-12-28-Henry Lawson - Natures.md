Nature's Call
In the dance of the wild, with the vibrant green hues,
Comes the spirit of nature, in everything new.
From the ridges of mountains to the shores of the sea,
In the symphony played, I am wild and free.
Oh, nature, you whisper tales of old lore,
Each leaf and each stone holds a secret in score.
With a heart ever open, I heed your sweet call,
In the essence of life, in your wonder, I fall.

- Henry Lawson
