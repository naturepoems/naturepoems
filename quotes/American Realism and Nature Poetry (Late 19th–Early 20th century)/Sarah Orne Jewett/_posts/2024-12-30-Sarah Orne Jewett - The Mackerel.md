The Mackerel

The mackerel lie swimming wild,  
In silver threads their fins unite;  
Let's plunge together into the sea—  
At night where shadows find their flight.  
In frothy waves they dance so free,  
Their pelagic forms as bright as day;  
Let me dive beneath their radiant grace—  
To hold the dream of every play!  
In depths, where sunlight meets the dark,  
Together we'll bob upon the swell;  
I find their spirit inviting here—  
To lose my thought, and bids farewell.

- Sarah Orne Jewett
