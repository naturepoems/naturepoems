TO THE SPRING

Oh heart of spring! The world of splendor calls,
Where crocus blooms and soft warm sun delights.
The grass beneath a tapestry of thralls,
Each petal kissed by dew in mornings bright.

Awake, heady fragrance strikes from blooming trees,
Call to the bees, they gather up the gold,
The winter chill retreats, a sweet release,
As new life dances forth, fresh tales unfold.


- Edna Saint Vincent Millay
