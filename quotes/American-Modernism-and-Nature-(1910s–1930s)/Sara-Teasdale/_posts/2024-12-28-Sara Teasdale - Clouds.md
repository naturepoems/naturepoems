Clouds

Mysterious clouds drift on high,
Like dreams that float on thoughts of old;
They hover and scatter, and sigh—
Their mysteries are quietly told.

I gaze at their shapes, slow-changing, free,
Shapes of wonder that dance in the breeze;
In their softness, I lose much of me,
And find peace in their tender tease.

- Sara Teasdale
