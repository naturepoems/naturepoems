The Forest

O sacred grove, beneath the brightened shade,
  Where hearts doth swell with natureâ€™s band,
Upon the leaves, that dance and sway,
  The woodland's peace dost understand.

   Here sorrows fade and joys bloom bright,
   The stars above, with flowers near,
And let this place be lost at night,
  While we bathe in the atmosphere.

- Ben Jonson
