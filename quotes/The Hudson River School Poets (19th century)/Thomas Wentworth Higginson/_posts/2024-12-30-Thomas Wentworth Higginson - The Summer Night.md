The Summer Night
  
The summer night, so chill and fair,
Infuses beauty in the quiet air,
And perfumes with its breath each crevice small—
How sweet the dewdrops touch the grassy hall.
Outside, the flora nods and sways,
And with their whispered breaths they dance and play —
The shadows deepen under the soft die,
While love’s pale hand exalts the evening’s sky.

Oh time, where art thou, as the night progresses?
This tranquil ease, time lightly caresses—
But fiery dreams kindle the heart’s desire,
As through the deep of magnolia’s spire,
The dreams awaited—a gift ajar;
While Love and Time bestow their kindly star.  


- Thomas Wentworth Higginson
