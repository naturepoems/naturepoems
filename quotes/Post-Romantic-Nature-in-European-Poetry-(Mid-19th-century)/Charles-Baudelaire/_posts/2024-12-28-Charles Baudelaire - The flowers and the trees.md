The flowers and the trees, 
In sunset’s golden glow, 
Whisper secrets soft and low, 
In colors warm, and memories, dear,
A perfume echoes through the air.

Who could resist such charms,
Nature’s tender arms embrace, 
In the garden’s soft, verdant grace, 
Life is reborn, sheds all alarms.

- Charles Baudelaire
