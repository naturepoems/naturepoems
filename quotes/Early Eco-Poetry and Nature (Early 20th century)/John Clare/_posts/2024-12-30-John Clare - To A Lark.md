To A Lark
O thou that singest like a bird  
And art the sign of winter's end,  
All hearts should own, yet few can hear  
Thy songs that strengthen heart and hand.
 
Up in the sky all day  
Thou’lt fly and call  
Where high above the tangle  
Of ruffled trees and open hall
 
Thou’’lt mark the mirth’s high way.
 
In springtime yet again,  
True song where natural joys are seen;  
A while these words be sung:  
Where beauty’s balm is ever green..

- John Clare
