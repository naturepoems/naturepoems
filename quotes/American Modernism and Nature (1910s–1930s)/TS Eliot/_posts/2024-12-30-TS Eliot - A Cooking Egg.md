A Cooking Egg

Old Pond
in green fields
lock against the air,
yellow dusk met
with silver pale,
each blade
addings of streaked pastels.

Has houses built themselves
of  tide water
and in invite
an interpretation.
Cantilevered mood
blighted light,
a tree-moon
may collect
in courting sun.

And the gust of rest
places rhythm,
measured in grains.
And pull of light,
grounds the past,
waning protest,
unplumbed depths thee,
we are vanishing into dust

- TS Eliot
