author: Amy Lowell
quote: "Evening Shadows  
    The shadows stretch as day declines,  
    Painting the earth in shades of night.  
    Stars come forth, in quiet designs,  
    Flickering candles in the twilight.  

    A hush descends, the world holds its breath,  
    In this sacred hour before sleep.  
    The fragrance of jasmine speaks of death,  
    Yet promises dreams, both vast and deep."

Evening Shadows  
    The shadows stretch as day declines,  
    Painting the earth in shades of night.  
    Stars come forth, in quiet designs,  
    Flickering candles in the twilight.  

    A hush descends, the world holds its breath,  
    In this sacred hour before sleep.  
    The fragrance of jasmine speaks of death,  
    Yet promises dreams, both vast and deep.
