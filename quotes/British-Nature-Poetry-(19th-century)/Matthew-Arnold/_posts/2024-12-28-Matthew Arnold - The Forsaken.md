The Forsaken Merman

Come in, the water’s clear and deep,
Come in, the waves below shall sweep
You to the wonders of our way,
Silence and peace, our lives shall play.

Deep in the caverns where fancies shine,
In this ocean blue, your dreams align.
And all our nests hang from the hidden rocks,
What more we'd lose, for that secret box!

We sing a soft lullaby sweet,
Soft like the waves, as tales repeat:
Together we drift, the dawn we greet,
My love, my lost one, life shall defeat.

Yet from the dark abyss we long,
Haunted by the echoes of a song;
Oh, lost to you! Sweet empty, near,—
The only sorrow left was here.

- Matthew Arnold
