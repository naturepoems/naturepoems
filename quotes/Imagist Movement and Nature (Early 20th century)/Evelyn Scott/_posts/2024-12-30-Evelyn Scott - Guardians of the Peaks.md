The mountains stand vigilant,
Guardians of an ancient realm,
With snow-capped peaks like crowns,
They pierce the clouds and sky,
A silent presence,
Worn yet stoicâ€”
Where eagles soar and dreams do dwell,
In their shadowed embrace,
Time whispers its secrets,
Among the valleys below.

- Evelyn Scott
