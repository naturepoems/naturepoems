A Song of Nature

Oh the sweetest song that nature knows,
Is sung in the bloom of the garden's rose,
Whether in the wild, or in the park,
Echoes of life begin to spark.

From the tallest pine to the tiniest sprout,
Listen, hear what life’s about;
Harmony swells in every corner,
Nature’s song, a joyful adorner.

- John Burroughs
