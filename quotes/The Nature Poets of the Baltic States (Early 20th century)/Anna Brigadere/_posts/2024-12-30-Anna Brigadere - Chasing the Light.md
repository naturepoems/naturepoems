The sunflowers turn their heads to the light,
Chasing the warmth of the day as it fades.
In fields where they stand, a magnificent sight,
A yellow sea dancing in gentle cascades.

Their laughter echoes in the warm summer breeze,
A celebration of life in the garden's expanse.
In their radiant glow, all sorrows find ease,
As nature's children join in the grand dance.

- Anna Brigadere
