The Moon was but a Chin of Gold  
A Night or two ago –  
And now she turns her perfect Face  
Upon the World below –  

Her Golden ear, a little slips,  
And all the Stars go by –  
Of Winter, all the Iris at our feet –  
In tender times to fly!  

While Night unrolls her Flier  
For the Fields of dew –  
The Watching Woodlands, trailing  
The Tail of Breath – anew.  

There's Music in the Cloudlands  
As the Moon unfolds –  
And Night wraps all her talons  
In petals of such gold!  

"The Moon was but a Chin of Gold"

- Emily Dickinson
