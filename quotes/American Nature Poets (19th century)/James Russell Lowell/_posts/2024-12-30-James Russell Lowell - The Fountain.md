The Fountain

O playful waters, full of cheer,
  Sprightly splashes dance about,
With joy awakened, pure and clear,
  Set all whisperings out.

Up, leap the waters, ceaseless swirl,
  Like laughter twisting free,
Enchanted moments grace the world,
  Lost in rapture, yet to be.

Gently flow in natureâ€™s holy stream,
  Where the laughter sings and bends,
Spending a lifetime, just to dream,
  With true love that never ends.

- James Russell Lowell
