A Fall of Snow

     The man 
     in the whiteness 
     of the trees,
     at peace 
with the little creatures, 
     the poverty of his life, 
     gives a lesson  
     in its sleep.  

     He gathers  
     the light at dusk, 
     lathe of time,  
     where the world lies 
     wrapped in the leaf’s 
     calm cover.

          For the snow  
     is soft, 
     holds no charge
     with this sweetness,  
     quickening my heart, 
     held beneath it,  
     life within death’s gift.

- R S Thomas
