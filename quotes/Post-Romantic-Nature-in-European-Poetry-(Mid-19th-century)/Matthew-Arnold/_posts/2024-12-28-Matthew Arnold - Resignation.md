Resignation

In the darkness, four whispers roll,  
Limitless stars warm every hour;  
There wounds of pain grant lightly hold,  
And drift the clay of a game of power.  
O lighten up the heart’s regained,  
And raise the world from idle strain—  
The shifted woods of green foliage red  
And mate the sun in love again.  

When every night leaves bloom of earth  
And life’s share mocked the pray I found,  
Then twilight stamped the dream of mirth,  
A mocking sound and silence bound.  
Yet all alone its season stays,  
For you to seek, and to muse its fair!  
Where roll arrives, and all cares play,  
To sway its hand for silver fair!


- Matthew Arnold
