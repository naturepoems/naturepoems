Winter’s Morning

The frost has caught the world in sleep,
Each blade of grass adorned in ice,
A fragile beauty temps the dawn,
And in the stillness, all is nice.

The whispering winds speak soft and low,
While snowflakes glisten on the ground,
Each flake a dream, a world so small,
Yet dreams are where true thoughts are found.

The naked trees stretch high, unbound,
And through them, freedom's song resounds;
So in the hush of winter's breath,
I hear the echoes life surrounds.
—Louis MacNeice
