Dream of the Sea

I dream of waves that kiss the shore,
Of endless tides that ebb and flow,
In salty air, my spirit soars,
Where nature's heart is free to grow.

Each crest and trough, a timeless dance,
That whispers secrets of the deep,
In every splash, a lullaby,
In ocean's arms, my soul shall sleep.


- Anna Akhmatova
