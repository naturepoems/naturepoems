Oread

Whirl up, seaâ€”
Whirl your pointed pines,
Splash your great pines
On our rocks,
Hurl your green over us,
Cover us with your pools of fir.

For the coast,
Rain your waters,
From the sky to the sea, 
Soak our errant feet.

May the wild air
Wander around us,
May your shadow fold
Over our dormant spirits.

Hurl your green over us,
Whirl your pointed pines,
Splash your great pines
On our rocks.
