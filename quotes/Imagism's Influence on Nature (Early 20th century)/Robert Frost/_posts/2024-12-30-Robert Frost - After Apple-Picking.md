After Apple-Picking
My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still,
And there's a barrel that I didn't fill
Beside it, and there may be two or three
Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.
But I am done with apple-picking now.

Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.
I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
I got from looking through a pane of glass
I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
And held against the world of hoary grass.
It melted, and I let it fall and break.

But I was well upon my way to sleep
Before it fell, and I had to call it after me
For I am done with apple-picking now.

Apple-picking's never done.

I am done with the things I see now,
And the wants that haunt me.
I am done with the world of night.
Let the apples be where they may.
For I am not the man I was last fall,
And I do not want to pick anymore.

- Robert Frost
