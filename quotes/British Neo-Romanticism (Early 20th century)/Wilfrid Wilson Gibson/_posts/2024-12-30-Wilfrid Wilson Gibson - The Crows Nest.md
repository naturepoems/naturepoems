The Crow's Nest

The old crow cawed in the top of the tree;
And it echoed over the place where the sun goes down.
The hills are creased and wrinkle their brows at me,
While the river twists as it flees with a frown.

I heard the grey shadows that shift as the stars,
And the rushes that whisper among the reeds.
The ghost of the moon is a dim dreamer, and far
Are the spirits that linger along the green meads.

I shall sit here, watching till daylight shall open
With kisses of light 'mid the shadows of night;
Till in red sheets of fire the dawn shall be spoken,
And I shall be snared in its gambits of light.

- Wilfrid Wilson Gibson
