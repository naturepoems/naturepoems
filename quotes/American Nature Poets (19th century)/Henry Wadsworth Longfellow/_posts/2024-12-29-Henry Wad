The Song of Hiawatha

The River of Life flows on and on,
  Ever in the light and shade,  
Through the dawning, noon, and sunset,
  Green and golden fields spread out.
Onward all, but from the quiet
to the cypress trees that grow  
In shadowed glades, they leap and flow.

The songs of mocking rapture wake
  In the hidden places of the woods,
Where shadows play and silence makes
  The spirits of the earth and woods
Drape their mysteries upon the way,
Breath of the forest and the stones.

Let your heart be tuned to harmony,
  As the river glides along,
But take heed of its gentle flow,
  And sing your song, and find your home.

This is the way of Nature dressed,
  In hues of life's grand state;
A tale mirrored in each riverâ€™s breast,
  Recalling secrets of fate.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
