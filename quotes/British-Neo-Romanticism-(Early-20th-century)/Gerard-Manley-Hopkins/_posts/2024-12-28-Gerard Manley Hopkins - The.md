The Windhover

I caught this morning morning's minion, king-
  Dove-tamer, and, of the earth, and of the air;
  the hero, of the heavens.
  Worshipped me in his gold;
  the fire in his throat.
  what passion to fly, fly!â€”
  In his sweeping and skimming
  as if to play, no sing.

    I saw him swoop
    the nightingale, and the sparrow
  the lark and the owls.
    All the creatures of the wild,
  embraced by the poetry of God.

  And the aching in my heart,
  That like a breaking dawn,
  to crown those rays yet.

But if I saw him in my heart's eye,
  you know not. If I could see the king,

As he steadies with a brave heart.

  And knows himself forever.

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
