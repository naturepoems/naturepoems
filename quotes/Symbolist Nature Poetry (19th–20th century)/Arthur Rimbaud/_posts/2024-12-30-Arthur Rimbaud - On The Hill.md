On the hill where nightfall weaves a spell,
In the arms of nature, my spirit doth dwell,
Winds carry tales from the mountains afar,
And starry-eyed dreams blend beneath the sun’s bar.
All the wildflowers unfold their delight,
Gilding the darkness with colors so bright,
With every heartbeat, their voices I know,
In the embrace of this world, forever I grow.

- Arthur Rimbaud
