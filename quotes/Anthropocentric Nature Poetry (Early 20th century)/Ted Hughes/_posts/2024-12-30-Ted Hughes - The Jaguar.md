The Jaguar

The Jaguar

I

The Jaguar in all its clinging, defiant grace
Explodes across that cage,
Challenging the hollowed walls
Of men’s constrained lives.
Flesh like a wrecking ball,
A thrilling beauty, it devours
The air around in a burst,
Devours them whole with its stare.

II

It sprawls, spiraling on a spurt,
And paces inevitable syllables,
In bursts and flashes, each scream
Unraveling written upon all of us.
A heart like hot blood,
What ecstasy lies behind the bars?
And I shudder, hoping to meet
Heels shoved beneath the fray.

III

What does it open? This stylish dart,
A pounce preserved in angular shapes,
That steals shadows, darting,
Rolling in rapturous noise.
But all the creeping wilderness stops,
Within an eye’s deadly perception.

- Ted Hughes
