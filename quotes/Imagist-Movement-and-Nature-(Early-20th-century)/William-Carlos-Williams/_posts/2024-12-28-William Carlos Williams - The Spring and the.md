The Spring and the Man
To say that spring wakes,
I mean
is wholly a lie.

For spring wakes all,
but the people who cannot see
what is before them.
But to look, into things,
and understand,
is immortal, and lifts a man.

In this dawn,

we, who can see,
stand still,
watch the stir,
these bloomens of the blood, and realize
life is coming on.


- William Carlos Williams
