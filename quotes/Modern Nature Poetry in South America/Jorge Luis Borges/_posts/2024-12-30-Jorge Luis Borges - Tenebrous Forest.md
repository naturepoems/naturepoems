Tenebrous Forest

In the rage and peace,
A forest of trees embracing,
Dancing shadows morph,
The essence of existence.

In whispers of the leaves,
Every root bears a story,
Hushed secrets enmeshed,
Underneath the canopy of dreams.

Here, solitude reigns
And yet, life breathes,
A paradox where darkness
And light coalesce as one.


- Jorge Luis Borges
