Cycle of Seasons

Winter’s grasp in silence,
Snow blankets the brown,
Muted tones of nature,
In the quiet, no sound.

Spring bursts forward, graceful,
Awakening in bloom,
Life comes forth in colors,
Filling all with perfume.

Summer, warm and golden,
A tapestry of bright,
Days stretch out in laughter,
Underneath the starlight.

Autumn paints with richness,
In hues of red and gold,
The cycle of the seasons,
Nature’s tales retold.


- Richard Huelsenbeck
