The Quiet Lake
 
A tranquil lake reflects the sky,  
With mirrored dreams that softly gleam,  
In quiet grace, where time floats by,  
Serenity, a gentle dream.  

The lapping waves, a soothing song,  
Invite the soul to linger long,  
In nature’s arms, where all feels right,  
A moment lost in pure delight.

- Edward Burne-Jones
