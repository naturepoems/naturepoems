In echoing woods, the spirits play,
Where shadows dance and sunbeams gleam,
Each vibrant hue a bright array,
Of nature’s brush, a living dream.

The seasons turn, each one a tale,
Of life entwined in ebb and flow,
An endless cycle, soft as veil,
In nature’s heart, we come to know.


- Rudolph Rudy H Dalrymple
