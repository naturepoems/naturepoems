The lark is ascending
But all in vain!
Upon the swell of branches,
It comes, it goes, it is true;

And once again, a fuller voice
Etched round the sky;—the day, is a soft hue;
So my love, too far, hath come
To speak my thoughts to thee once more;

A soft whisper is the echo
Of what I cannot bear to say;
Where all is silence, no evocation;
So near—the lark—is soaring forth,
Through skies as azure, white wings blindly;

- Lord Byron
