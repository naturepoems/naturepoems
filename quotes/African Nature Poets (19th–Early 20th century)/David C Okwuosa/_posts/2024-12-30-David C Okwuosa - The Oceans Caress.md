The Ocean’s Caress

Waves crash gently on the shore,
An endless dance, forevermore,
The ocean sings in a rhythmic swell,
Its voice a soothing, timeless spell.

In its depths, stories lay hidden,
Of lives once lost, of journeys bidden,
The tides reflect the moon’s own sigh,
As day meets night, and the seagulls fly.

- David C Okwuosa
