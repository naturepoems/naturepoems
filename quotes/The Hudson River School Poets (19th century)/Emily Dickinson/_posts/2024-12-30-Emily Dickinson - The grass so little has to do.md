The grass so little has to do,  
A Sphere of simple Green –  
Yet highly prized for the Oil,  
To the Sky of Heroes keen.  

It fades beneath the Foot –  
Then brings the higher Vale –  
A Cradle for the weary –  
Elysian Hill of Grace.  

Each blade a grasping Anchor,  
Each blade a rope to Heaven  
By which on wings of Synod,  
The weary Grove may rise.  

"The grass so little has to do"

- Emily Dickinson
