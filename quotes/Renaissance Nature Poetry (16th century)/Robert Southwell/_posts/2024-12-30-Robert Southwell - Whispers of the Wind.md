Ode unto the gentle wind,
Whose whispers wake the sleeping kin,
You sing through forest, field, and glade,
With every surge, our fears you fade.
Your breath, a balm upon the land,
Every soft caress, a guiding hand,
To lead the soul from dark to light,
In natureâ€™s arms, we find our flight.

- Robert Southwell
