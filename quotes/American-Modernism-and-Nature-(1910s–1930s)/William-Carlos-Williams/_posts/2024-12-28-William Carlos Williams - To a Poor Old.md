To a Poor Old Woman
munching a plum
on the road—you

hunger for

what the world

is but a

plum of cold

green leaf.

It is riches to eat

and fill oneself.

Here in this empty

place among the trees

where more and more

is the sky.

Here I would sit

and share and delay.


- William Carlos Williams
