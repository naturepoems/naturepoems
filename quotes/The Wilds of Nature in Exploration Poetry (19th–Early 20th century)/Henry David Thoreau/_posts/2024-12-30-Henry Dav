To the Birds

To the birds that grace the morning sky,
With wings so free, they dance and fly;
You sing your songs with joyful ease,
A celebration of life and breeze.

In every note, a tale is spun,
Of warm days kissed by golden sun;
And as you flit from tree to tree,
You teach me how to simply be.

So let me wander, heed your call,
In your presence, I feel it all;
For in your flight, I learn to soar,
With nature's love forevermore.

- Henry David Thoreau
