Ode to the Seasons

Oh, seasons change and dance in time,
With winter’s chill and summer’s rhyme,
Each one a thread in Nature’s loom,
In colors bright, they chase the gloom.

From springtime blooms to autumn’s gold,
Each tale a gift, each memory told,
In Nature’s heart, we find our way,
Embracing life both night and day.


- Franklin P Adams
