The Nightingale: A Conversational Poem
A momently-extended Word,
What stirs Heart; what breathes Soul,
From tree to tree, from breast to breast!

The distance grand—quick echoes run;
Sleep! in the momentary night,
When the owlet’s eyes begin to glance,
At another coming hour of Spring.

- Samuel Taylor Coleridge
