A Farewell to the Hudson

Oh Hudson, great and grand and free,
Thy banks resound with lovely song;

In natureâ€™s arms, I find in thee,
A place where I have long belong.

Adieu, dear river, thou dost flow,
Through changing years so bright and blue;

Your gentle waves now softly glow,
As I, my heart in thy embrace renew.


- Philip Freneau
