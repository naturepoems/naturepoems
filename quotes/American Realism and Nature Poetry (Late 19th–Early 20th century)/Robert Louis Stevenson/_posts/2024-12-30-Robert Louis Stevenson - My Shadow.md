My Shadow
I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,  
       And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.

He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;  
       And I see him jump before me when I jump into my bed.

The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow—  
       Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;

For he sometimes shoots up taller like an India rubber ball,  
       And he sometimes gets so little that there’s none of him at all.

He hasn’t got a notion of how children ought to play,  
       And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.

His whole existence has a shade, with thinks of being out,  
       He may be warm and dear,  
       But is also far away and doubt.




- Robert Louis Stevenson
