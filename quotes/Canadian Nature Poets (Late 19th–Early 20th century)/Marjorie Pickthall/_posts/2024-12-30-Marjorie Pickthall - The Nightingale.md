The Nightingale

In the stillness of the night it sings,
A song of longing, soft and sweet,
Among the shadows, the world it brings
To life; a melody of heartbeat.

Its voice is tender, pure as dew,
In moonlit glades where dreams arise,
It weaves a spell, so soft, so true,
A nightingale beneath the skies.

- Marjorie Pickthall
