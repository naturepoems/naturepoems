Blooming Madness
Flowers riot under the weight of color,
As sanity unravels in the fragrance,
Infinite, yet constrained,
In the folds of time gone lunatic.

The lily weeps in moonlight,
And all the while, the daisies fade,
Insisting on their fragile glory,
With each petal lost and found again,
Amidst a dance of forgotten dreams.

Yet still, the garden breathes,
Existing in dystopia divine,
Where the wild sings, and sanity bows,
In unison with the pulse of the earth.

- Hugo Ball
