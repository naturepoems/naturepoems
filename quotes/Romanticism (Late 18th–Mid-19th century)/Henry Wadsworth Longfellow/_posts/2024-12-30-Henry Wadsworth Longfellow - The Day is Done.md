The Day is Done

The day is done, and the night is here;  
The shadows fall as day does fade.  
I close my eyes, and without fear,  
Embrace the peace that nature’s made.

The whispers of the evening breeze,  
The rustling leaves adrift in air,  
A melody that puts at ease  
All troubles, all my worldly care.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
