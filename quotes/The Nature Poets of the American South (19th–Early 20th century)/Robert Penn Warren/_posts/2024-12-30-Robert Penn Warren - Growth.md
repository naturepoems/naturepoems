Growth

From seed to sapling, the dream begins,
In shadow and sun, where the journey spins,
Life pushes forth from earth's embrace,
Craving the light, the vital space.

The roots entwine in dark, rich mold,
While leaves reach high to the sun, grown bold,
A vibrant dance in storm and calm,
Nature's truth in palm and psalm.

Life knows the art of reaching high,
Finding strength as it reaches for the sky,
In growth, there lies an ancient art,
To seek, to strive, to play its part.


- Robert Penn Warren
