Autumn's Kiss

With gardens kissed by summer’s hand,
   And the leaves now swirl in soft decay,
Autumn drapes her golden band,
   In farewell, bidding summer stay.

The air, it dances, crisp and bright,
   As shades of amber drift and twirl,
In fleeting moments of day and night,
   The earth breathes deep, its colors unfurl.

Each rustle stirs a bittersweet sigh,
   A promise kept, though days grow short,
In twilight’s gentle, limpid sky,
   The heart finds solace, warm and court.
