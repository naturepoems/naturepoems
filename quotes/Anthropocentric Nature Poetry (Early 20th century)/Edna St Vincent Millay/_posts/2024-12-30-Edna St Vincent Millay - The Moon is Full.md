The moon is full, the night is bright,
And love sits nestled in the trees,
With shining stars and silver light,
To cast away our every grief.
For nature holds our secrets tight,
In the shimmer of the leaves in flight,
And as we walk beneath the night,
Let our hearts soar like the eagleâ€™s might.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
