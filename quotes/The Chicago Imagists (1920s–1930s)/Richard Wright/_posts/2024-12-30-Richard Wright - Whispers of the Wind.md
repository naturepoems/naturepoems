Wind rustles the leaves,
Each one a whisper of time,
Nature’s breath in motion,
Carrying secrets on its wings.

I stand within the trees,
Their stories etched in bark,
A history of storms survived,
And sunlight kissed by years.

In this moment, I am still,
Grounded by the roots below,
Part of this world’s embrace,
Connected to the pulse of life,
Beneath the sky’s vast heart.

- Richard Wright
