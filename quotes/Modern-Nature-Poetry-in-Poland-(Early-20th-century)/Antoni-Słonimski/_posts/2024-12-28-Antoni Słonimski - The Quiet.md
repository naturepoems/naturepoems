The Quiet Stream

A winding path of silver gleam,
The stream flows on through mossy stone,
In tranquil depths, reflections dream,
The solace found when one’s alone.

Gentle murmurs, secrets flow,
Tales of ages past and near,
In nature's heart, the waters glow,
Where life unfolds, and fate is clear.

Among the willows, soft and sway,
The spirit revels in the scene,
In every ripple, joy at play,
In the quiet stream, pure and serene.
