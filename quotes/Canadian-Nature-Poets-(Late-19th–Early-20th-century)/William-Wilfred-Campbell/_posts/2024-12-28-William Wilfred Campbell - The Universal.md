The Universal Spirit
In yon deep blue of the sky,
I hear the spirit calling clear,
It sweeps the heart with a soft sigh,
Like some sweet voice that I can hear.

It whispers of the woodlands vast,
And of the rivers broad and free,
Of flowers that bloom, of shadows cast,
Of all that lives in harmony.

It calls me forth, and I can see
The beauty of this life in me.



The Song of the Woods
O, come with me, my friend of old,
Into the woods so deep and still,
Where every tree is a tale untold,
And the breeze is a breath of thrill.

Here the bluebird sings his song,
And the squirrel leaps from bough to bough,
While the brooklet flows in murmurs strong,
As if to teach us, here and now.

Let us wander, hand in hand,
Through the sacred, sunlit land.



An Autumn Evening
The sun sinks low, the sky is bright,
With copper lights that softly gleam,
The forest wraps in the fleece of night,
And the stars awaken, one by one, to dream.

A hush is spread on the fields and wood,
Where the deer tread soft on the golden leaves,
And in the heart of the solitude,
There’s peace that from the quiet weaves.

Oh, let us linger, let us stay,
In the balmy breath of the dying day.



The Waste of the World
In barren lands where silence reigns,
Where no sweet flowers ever bloom,
There lies a place of broken chains,
And souls that suffer in the gloom.

Yet in the heart of this desolate waste,
The spirit of life still holds its ground,
For beauty often walks in haste,
And in the shadows, hope is found.

So look with tender eyes, my friend,
For nature’s heart can never end.



Beyond the Valley
Beyond the valley, where the wild roses sweep,
And the silver streams in the sunlight shine,
There lies a world that sings us to sleep,
Where the perfume of blossoms softly combine.

Through meadows where the bright daisies play,
By the humming of bees in the warm summer air,
Let us wander far, far away,
To the place where life is rich and rare.

For nature’s beauty, strong and free,
Is the balm of life, my friend, to thee.

- William Wilfred Campbell
