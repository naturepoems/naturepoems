Embers of Dawn

As the night gives way to the dawn,  
the world stirs from slumber,  
a symphony of awakening,  
each ray of light a conductor,  
a chorus rising in the east.

The sky transforms into ember hues,  
a canvas of fire igniting the horizon,  
while the first notes of birdsong  
fill the air with promise,  
a reminder that each day is new.

Here, in the quiet moments,  
I find clarity and peace,  
a connection to the world unfurling,  
a deep-seated understanding  
of natureâ€™s perpetual cycle.

- Lyda E Rodriguez
