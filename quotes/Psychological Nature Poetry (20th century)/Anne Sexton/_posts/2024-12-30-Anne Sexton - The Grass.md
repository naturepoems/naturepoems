The grass is so green it is blue,
Like I’ve put my face to a sea,
Or my naked belly to a lake.
-It tastes real and holy.
No—look, all around me
Is a softness made out of air.
I can never stop saying it.
I bury my fingers in the grass,
In the hay, almost hoping the sky
Will fall down around us.
I want to breathe in all the
Wonders of the earth.
Blossoms and thorns, blown leaves
Wiggling beneath my feet.
Maybe the sun will catch my eye,
But I need to return
To this green, this comfort
Beneath the wide and open sky.



- Anne Sexton
