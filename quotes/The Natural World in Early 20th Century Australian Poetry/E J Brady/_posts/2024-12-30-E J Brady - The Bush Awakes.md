The Bush Awakes

Awake! awake!  
The bush is waking from its sleep;  
The sun is creeping through the trees,  
And stirring up the old tall grass  
That holds the dew like beads of pearls,  
And makes the world a camp-out.  

The bird calls out, a note so bright,  
As if the morn must greet the night;  
The stir of life is in the air,  
The wildflowers bloom everywhere.  

The shadows dance with spirits bright,  
In this new day of golden light;  
The beauty of the bush surrounds,  
And in its heartâ€”the song resounds.

- E J Brady
