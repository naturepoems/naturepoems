Born amidst spun sunrays of dawn,
I am scattered in this luminous lattice,
A delicate order of petals,
The flower bows under skies untorn,
Beneath the frame of inevitable day,
Where shadows of fragile willows whisper,
Tender gulps of healing winds.
Let them become the vessels
Which carry my thoughts,
Amplified in the coolness of the breeze—
For within the breath of the earth,
Do we not find the journey continual,
A life woven through the layers of every season?

- Mina Loy
