Nature
---

Nature is a momentous sight,
That gives us peace and pure delight,
In boughs of green and scents of wood,
Each detail a reflection of the good.

To watch the sun kiss the horizon low,
To hear the birds in choir flow,
What treasures linger in earthâ€™s embrace,
In quietude, we find our grace.

O Nature! You speak, a sacred ruse,
In whispers soft, we choose our muse.


- Henry David Thoreau
