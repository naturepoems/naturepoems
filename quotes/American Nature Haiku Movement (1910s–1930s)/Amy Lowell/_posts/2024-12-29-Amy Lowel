Autumn

I.
The autumn spreads its gilded wings,  
As trees turn into flames of gold,  
And the air is thick with crispness,  
Whispers of a season that turns old.  

II.
Each leaf, a memory of summer past,  
Lies like treasure upon the ground,  
Where life has danced in vibrant motion,  
Now settles down, solid and round.  

III.
In the fading light of this warm glow,  
I gather thoughts of what has been,  
And breathe in the scent of the earth,  
As autumn wraps the world in a dream.

- Amy Lowell
