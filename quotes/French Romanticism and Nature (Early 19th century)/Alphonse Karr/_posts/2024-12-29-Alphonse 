The Calling of Spring

With the thaw of the earth, and the lifting of snow,
Comes a chorus of voices, a soft, warming glow;
The crocus breaks ground, proclaiming the birth,
Of spring and her blessings, a miracleâ€™s worth.

Amidst daffodils blooming in fields wide and free,
The pulse of the flowers syncs with the tree;
As nature awakens, so too does my soul,
In this dance of renewal, I feel myself whole.

- Alphonse Karr
