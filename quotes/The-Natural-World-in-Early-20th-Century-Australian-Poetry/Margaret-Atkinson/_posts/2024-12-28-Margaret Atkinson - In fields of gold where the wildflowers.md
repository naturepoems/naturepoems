In fields of gold where the wildflowers sway,
The sun spills warmth upon the earth,
With every breath, the spirit sings,
Of nature's profound, endless worth.

The whispers in the evening breeze,
Carries tales of days gone by,
As shadows dance beneath the moon,
A canvas painted in the sky.

- Margaret Atkinson
