quote: "Silent rain falls gently on the leaves,  
Each drop a tiny world reflected,  
In the distance, a soft flute of wind,  
Calls to the trees to sway and dance,  
Nature's breath—a tender hymn sung."

Silent rain falls gently on the leaves,  
Each drop a tiny world reflected,  
In the distance, a soft flute of wind,  
Calls to the trees to sway and dance,  
Nature's breath—a tender hymn sung.
