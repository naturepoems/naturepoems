As autumn leaves begin to fall,  
A tapestry of red and gold,  
Nature whispers her meaningful call,  
In each flutter, a story told.
  
And in that dance of death and birth,  
Life cycles through its endless art,  
Finding beauty in what is worth,  
In nature's rhythm, we play our part.


- Friedrich Hölderlin
