There is a solitude of space,
A solitude of sea,
A solitude of death, and a solitude of life,
This is a greater thing than any of these.

The wide and wondrous world we traverse,
Filled with beauty and silent strife,
Yonder sun, yonder moon,
Are but hints of its deepest essence.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
