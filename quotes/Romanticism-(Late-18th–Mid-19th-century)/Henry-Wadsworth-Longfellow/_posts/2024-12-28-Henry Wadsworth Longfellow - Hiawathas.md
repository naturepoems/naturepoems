Hiawatha's Departure
By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

O the delight of leaving!  
O the joy of going!
To the sky, the sun, and clouds,
To the river, flowing garden!  
To the air, harmonious songs,
Filling hearts with love unending.
It is the best time of the year, 
When forgetful starlings borrow
Mellow tones from flowing waters, 
Linking hands with all things living.
As autumn whispers in trees,
The wind may carry laughter and sigh,
While Hiawatha walks his journey,  
Receiving every last kiss from  the Earth.
