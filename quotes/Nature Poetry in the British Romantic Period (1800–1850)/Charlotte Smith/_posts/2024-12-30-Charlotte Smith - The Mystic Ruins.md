The Mystic Ruins,
   by Charlotte Smith

And there upon the crumbling stone,  
Where ivy weaves its tendrils round,  
Lie secrets of the hills, and groans,  
In memories the winds resound.  

The sylvan shades shall not disdain  
To guard the dreams that haunt the night;  
Where tarnished glories knew no pain,  
And fading glimpses grow more bright.

- Charlotte Smith
