Snowfall
In soft descent, the snowflakes fall,
a whispered hush blankets the land,
with crystalline gems that gently call,
a winter's spell by nature's hand.

Each flake a dream, unique and fair,
atop the world, a delicate shroud,
transforming all in quiet care,
a wonder done, a mind enshrouded.

In this stillness, I find my muse,
a fleeting moment where time does freeze,
for in the snowfallâ€™s gentle cues,
nature speaks with tranquil ease.


- Thomas S P S Munch
