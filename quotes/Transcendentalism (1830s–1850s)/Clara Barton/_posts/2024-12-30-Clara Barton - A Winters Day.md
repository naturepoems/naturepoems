A Winter's Day

The field is dressed in white repose,
A canvas kissed by winter’s breath,
Where every branch a crystal glows,
As nature quiets, still, in death.

Yet beauty lies in frosted hue,
A landscape sparkling, calm, serene;
In monochrome, a world anew,
Where stillness reigns like a queen.

- Clara Barton
