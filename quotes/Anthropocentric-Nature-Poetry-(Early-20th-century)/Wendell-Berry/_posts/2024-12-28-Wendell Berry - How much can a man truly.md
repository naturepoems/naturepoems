How much can a man truly love
   except where he counts himself?
   In the eyes of the beloved,
                           the furrows of the fields,
   the untilled soil filled with promise
                           in the wake of morning light.

The trees whisper always in truth,
   the dark green of their leaves
                   tells me of patience
and the rhythms of the seasons.
   Each moment an invitation
                        to rest in this world
and let the beauty wash
                 over the tired heart.


- Wendell Berry
