When lavender clouds touch the sea,
I hear the calls of the quiet tides.
In a swirl of colors that dance and flow,
New echoes of the leaf that abides.
Let us wander through the sleeping fields,
Of daisies and the soft wheat’s grain,
Where whispers float on zephyrs' yield,
As heaven envelops this earthly domain. 


- Robert Graves
