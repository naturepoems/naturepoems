The Quiet Stream
The quiet stream that softly flows,
   Reflects the starry sky,
And all the world in peace knows,
   Beneath the moonâ€™s soft eye.

Here nature sings her sweetest song,
   A melody profound,
Where spirits, free, can wander long,
   In solace, peace is found.


- James Russell Lowell
