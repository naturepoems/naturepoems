On First Looking into Chapman's Homer
Much have I travelled in the realms of gold,
And many good authors, and whose bliss  
In the lectures of all science seemed to unfold  
Glad hours or seldom forlorn;  
And in a stillness past thought, whose trim ons  
Like stars that quicken full as the sound  
Where all things raised, once more again.
—John Keats
