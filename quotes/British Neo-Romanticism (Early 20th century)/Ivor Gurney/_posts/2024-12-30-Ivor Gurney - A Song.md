A Song

                  As the nightingale takes flight
                  On the quiet edges of the morn;
                  I saw you rise, out of the dew,
                  Reflected in the soft light's adorn.
                  
                  The white waves cover the stony shore,
                  And I whisper to the tide, "more!"
                  The winds of change blow through the vale;
                  Her song, a fragrant, sweet detail.
                  
                  O woodland's whisper, where I roam,
                  Beneath the shade of kin and clover;
                  Where daisies be, and the doves coo warmâ€”
                  There in the song, my heart, my home.

- Ivor Gurney
