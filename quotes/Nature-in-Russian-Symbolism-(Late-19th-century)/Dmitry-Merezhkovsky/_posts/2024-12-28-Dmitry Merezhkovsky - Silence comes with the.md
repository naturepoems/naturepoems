Silence comes with the dusk,
a heavy curtain drawn,
where a stillness deepens,
filled with whispers of leaves,
soft rustling, hinting at life
that stirs in shadows
of the ancient trees.

In evening's embrace,
the world is at peace;
a silver moon spills her light
on the meandering stream.
Nature breathes quietly,
and the heart listens, full of dreams.

- Dmitry Merezhkovsky
