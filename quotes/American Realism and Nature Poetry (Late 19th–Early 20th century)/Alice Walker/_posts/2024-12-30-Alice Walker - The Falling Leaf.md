A single leaf falls,
a poem writing itself in the wind,
spiraling gracefully,
a farewell to the tree,
the keeper of its stories.

Nature cradles this goodbye,
a soft embrace,
as the ground receives it,
a home for this journey,
a continuation of life,
as seasons turn,
as time flows.

In the quiet of falling,
I find strength,
a lesson in letting go,
a testament to change,
a reminder that beauty
is in the cycle,
in each ending, each beginning.

- Alice Walker
