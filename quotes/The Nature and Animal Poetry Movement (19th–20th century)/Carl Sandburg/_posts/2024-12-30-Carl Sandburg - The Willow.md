The willow tree bends,
rub the soft palms
of my two hands,
sweet and wild  
under the sunlight.  
They are good friends
of the river.
They carry the dreams
of the men  
who fish for happiness
and they live hidden
in the silence of children.

The waves of green
break in laughter,
and the wind plays the sound
of their finest leaves,
Starlight upon the strands,

- Carl Sandburg
