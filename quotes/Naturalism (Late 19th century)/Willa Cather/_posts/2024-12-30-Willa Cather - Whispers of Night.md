Beneath the stars where the world meets the night,
Each flicker of starlight ignites dreams of flight.
The oceans are whispers, the mountains, a sigh,
As nature envelops and bids us to try.

To walk in the shadows, where silence is strong,
To feel every heartbeat within nature's song.
An echoing language of spirit and peace,
Where in the bosom of nature, the worries release.


- Willa Cather
