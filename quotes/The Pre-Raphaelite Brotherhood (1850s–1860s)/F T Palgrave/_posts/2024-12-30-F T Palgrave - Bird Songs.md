Bird Songs
In a sunlit glade, where shadows play,  
The songs of the birds greet the day;  
From morning till night, their notes do ring,  
In a lovely chorus, they teach us to sing.  
The lark in the sky, so high and so free,  
The robin so brave, in the leafy tree,  
Each bird tells a story, in melody's sway,  
While we sit enchanted, led gently away.  
So let us listen to nature’s sweet choir,  
Their songs lift the spirit, their joy never tires.  
Let the warm sunlight and music entwine,  
For in harmony’s breath, our hearts shall align.
