The Crow

I

I had a dream that I was walking
at the edge of a lake.
And in it, I saw the dead
rising from their tombstones,
as clouds drift over the sun.
I had a dream that I was walking
and I was always walking
for a long, long way,
but I never got anywhere.

II

Not far from the water’s edge,
ice glistening, puckered
like an old man’s skin.
And moisture that clung
so thickly to me that it
became my own.
I watched the fish skirt
past my bare feet, egg-eyed,
with mouths gaping for air.
And I saw the splattered flocks
of crows winging down.
Their beaks black and shining
like broken glass.
They settled,
waiting for the next
turn of day.

- Ted Hughes
