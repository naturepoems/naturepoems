A Private

We will forget them, and find our way,
To breathe the strange air of delight;
Then we will wander through the day,
Where shadows fall and birds take flight.

And when we feel the chill of lack,
In forests wide, we find the path,
The footsteps trace until we track
A tree of dreams entwined with wrath.

Oh joy and peace amidst the green,
The rustling leaves of carefree spring.
The tune of longing sings unseen,
A heart with nature's pulse does bring.

- Edward Thomas
