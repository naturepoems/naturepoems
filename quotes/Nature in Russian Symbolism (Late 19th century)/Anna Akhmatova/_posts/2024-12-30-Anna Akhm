In the garden alive with color,
Petals unfold like pages of a book,
Stories of beauty sing from roses,
While butterflies dance in courtly joy.
And as the sun dips low in the sky,
I gather whispers of warmth and light,
Planting these hopes in my tired heart,
To bloom again when darkness takes flight.

- Anna Akhmatova
