The Summer's End
As summer wanes to autumnâ€™s grace,
The golden fields lay bare and dry;
Yet in their silence, we can trace
The joys that linger, never die.

With harvest moon, we gather close,
The fruits of work, of laughter shared;
In every bite, the heart will boast,
Of seasons past and dreams declared.

- Ilya Ehrenburg
