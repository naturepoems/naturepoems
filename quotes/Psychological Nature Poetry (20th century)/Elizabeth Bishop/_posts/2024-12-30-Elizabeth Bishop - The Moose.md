The Moose

From loblolly pines
and the mean, dark hardiness of spruces,
a road just barely taken
slips up and in, leading away
into the fresh open space,
just as it came down
to meet a lake.

And then, as if surprised,
a small moose appears,
not imminent but late, long
and slow in striking poses,
anchoring himself
in the middle ground between
parsley and the edge of winter.
