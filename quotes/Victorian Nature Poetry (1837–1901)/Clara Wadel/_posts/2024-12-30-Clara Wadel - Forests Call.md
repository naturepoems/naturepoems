Forest's Call

Within the woods, the ancients stand,
With gnarled roots and branches wide,
They whisper tales of this old land,
In every breeze, their secrets bide.

The ferns unfurl like tales untold,
The ivy clings in green embrace,
In emerald dreams, the wild unfold,
A tranquil mind finds sacred space.

Each rustling leaf, a fleeting thought,
Each pathway leads to who knows where,
In nature’s haven, lessons sought,
The forest's call, a timeless prayer.

- Clara Wadel
