Oh, to wander amongst the reeds!
To find the medium of waters
In between my limbs—
Where laughter springs in droplets,
And the sun drenches every sinew
With liquid warmth.
Let me roam into delights hidden,
Where violets dance underfoot,
Once discovered, can never be lost—
Here within this lost lattice
Of angles and grasses striving,
Each part is a letter to be spelled,
Into existence, in whispers drawn
Across the wildness of our hearts.

- Mina Loy
