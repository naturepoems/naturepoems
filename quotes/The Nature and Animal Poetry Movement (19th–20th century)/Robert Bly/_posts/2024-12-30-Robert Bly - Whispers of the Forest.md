Whispers of the Forest

In the heart of the forest,  
Echoes of the ancients dwell,
Moss carpets the earth softly,  
And the tall trees breathe  
A rhythm of solace.

The shy deer glimpse my presence,
As the sun sweeps through leaves—  
Here, life unfolds in secret spaces,  
And the whispering voices,  
Sing of love and eternity.


- Robert Bly
