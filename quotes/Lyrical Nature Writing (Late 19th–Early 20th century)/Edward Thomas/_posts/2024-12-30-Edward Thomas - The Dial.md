The Dial

There is a lady, young and pale,
Who wanders round with gentle smiles,
Keeping time beneath the veil,
Of seasons' change and nature's trials.

Upon her face, the sunlit glow,
Lights long shadows the day must tell,
In every tick another flow,
Of life so precious, a quiet spell.


- Edward Thomas
