A river doesn’t change, yet grows,
each current winding, winding back
into the fold of banks where shadows
of trees arch down to sip,
fishes spawn, and herons wait.

It is immersion—depth's embrace,
no beginning, no end—just a flow
that catches light on the brinks,
just as thoughts surf on the edge of dreams,
just as we sip from the cup of seasons.
