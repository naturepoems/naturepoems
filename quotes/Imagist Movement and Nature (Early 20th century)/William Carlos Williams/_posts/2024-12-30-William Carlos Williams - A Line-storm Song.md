A Line-storm Song

In the dark of the evening

when the wind blows and the leaves fall
to the ground

and the rain descends upon the earth

let no one think that I am dead,

that I am still living;

but so that I may remain,

I would lift up my voice

with the wind, like a bird,

and with the rains,

till I am whole

again, so that I may walk

in the fields among the flowers.

- William Carlos Williams
