Chase the sun through the fields of green,
every petal reaching for its warm embrace.

Nectar sweet on the lips of flowers,
a chorus of life rising in the breeze.

Here the earth drinks from the sky,
a never-ending cycle of love and loss.

Breathe deep the fragrance of life,
let it linger, let it fill your being.

- Kate Bush
