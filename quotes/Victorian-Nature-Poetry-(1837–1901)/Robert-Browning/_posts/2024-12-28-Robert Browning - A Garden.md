A Garden Fair
Within the garden fair of thee,
Pensive and clear, amid the dew,
That trickles down a bough's soft knee,
And all the leaves are fresh and new.
The flowers bloom in glad array,
Follow each sunbeam's guiding ray,
And nature's heart, with joy afire,
Drinks in the warmth of sweet desire.

- Robert Browning
