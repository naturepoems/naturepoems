Oysters

In the rockiest places, salty love seeped,
Between the crevices of toil,
The oyster grips the ancient stone,
Making life in brined pools of consumer delight;
Each shell, a world in itself, encased,
Held tightly, ever generating,
A circle of new beginnings, born each day,
In the calm embrace of ocean hum.

- Marianne Moore
