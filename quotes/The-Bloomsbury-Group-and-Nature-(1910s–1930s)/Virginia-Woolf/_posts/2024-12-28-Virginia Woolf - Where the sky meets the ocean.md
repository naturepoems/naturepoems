Where the sky meets the ocean blue,
  There lies a horizon whispered,
  In dreams of travelers lost in time,
  I wander the seams of this vast expanse.
  Clouds roll like waves,
  Mustering a storm of thoughts—
  Each fleeting shape takes me away,
  To a realm where sky and sea intertwine.

  - from "Horizon Dreams" (1926)
