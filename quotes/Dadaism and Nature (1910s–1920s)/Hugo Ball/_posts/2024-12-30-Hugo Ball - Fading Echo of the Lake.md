Fading Echo of the Lake
Amidst the tranquil waters,
The lake mirrors the sky,
As swans glide through reflections,
Each ripple a note in a longing.

The wind stirs soft reveries,
As reeds sway in approval,
While the sun bathes everything golden,
Smiling softly in the distance,
A kinship blossoming in silence,
With hearts blooming out of time.

- Hugo Ball
