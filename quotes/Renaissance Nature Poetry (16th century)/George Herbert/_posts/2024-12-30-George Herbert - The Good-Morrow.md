The Good-Morrow

I took thy contours into my design  
And papered them against the walls of light,  
For that good-morrow round the rocks we find.  
For this, O Lord, may it be a gift divine  
To call our echoes from the night  
To lifeâ€”they sing thy name in every voice  
As every rock and tree shall bless, rehearse  
In prayerful praise what lovely things should be  
For rose brings dew from the break of morn.



- George Herbert
