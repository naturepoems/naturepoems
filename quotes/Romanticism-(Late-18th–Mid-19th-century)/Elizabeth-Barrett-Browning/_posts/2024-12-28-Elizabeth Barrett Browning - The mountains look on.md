The mountains look on Marathon—
And Marathon looks on the sea;
And musing there an hour alone,
I dreamed that Greece might still be free;
For standing on the Persians’ grave,
I would not be a slave!

A lady, happy at the heart,
(The too proud woman, as I said)
Whose happy taste did run to Art,

And so she went to see the show,
For _she_ was happy, and I read
That she would give her ring of gold
To feel a single sign of womanhood;  

And I, in the garden with no sign to call,
Did bow to life as a sealed-up thing,
O glory, or she did in no sense know
The prospect of long years to be free once more—  

Yet would you meet, with every tree,  
So steeped in rays of light, in rain,  
In shadows long, and invalid,  
Or have you grasped the end of hope?

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
