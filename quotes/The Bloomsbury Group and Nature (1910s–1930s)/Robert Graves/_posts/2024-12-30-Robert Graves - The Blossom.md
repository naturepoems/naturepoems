Oh sweetest blossom of the air,
I follow through the clover glow,
An echo of the dawn so fair,
In the hush of the willow's flow.
From her green glory let me sip
The dew that clings to trembling leaves,
And feel the sunlight on my lip,
Where summer's thrill her beauty weaves.

The softest breeze shakes earth and sky,
And every songbird starts to sing;
Come, hear the stillness, come, oh, die
With me as nature takes her wing.
Now let us breathe the morning's grace,
Together in this lovely place. 


- Robert Graves
