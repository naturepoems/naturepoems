Creatures stir beneath,
The shroud of inky night,
Life swirls in darkness,
As the moon watches.
Every creature a note,
In the song of this realm,
The dance begins anew,
Under the silver glow.
I am a witness,
To the mysteries unfold,
In this sacred space,
Of hidden harmony.

               – From "Dance of the Night"
