The River
Flowing soft in its endless pursuit,
The river carves its way through land,
With whispers of life, strong and absolute,
Its current drawing with gentle hand.
Each bend a story, timeless, true,
Reflecting the stars that brightly gleam,
In this liquid path where dreams come through,
Natureâ€™s pulse, a flowing dream.



- Julian Grenfell
