Ode to the autumnal leaves:
When every tree's adorned with weariness,
And shades of brown whisper tales of rest,
The season ripens, and I must confess—
I find in decay a kind of blessedness.

From vibrant greens to twisted brown,
In each crisp sound of leaves falling down,
Lies the wisdom that nature should bestow:
In endings, beginnings, the continuum flows.

So here I stand, in nature's rhythm,
With the songs that speak of her splendid hymn,
May I be like the leaves, in flight, find release,
To dance in the wind, to cherish the peace.
— John Clare
