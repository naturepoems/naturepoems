As the dawn breaks anew,
A symphony of colors arise,
Each ray, a brushstroke,
Painting the day into existence.

Birds take flight in the stillness,
Their wings cutting through the silence,
Freedom embodied in every beat,
An unbound testament to dawn.

Let the cool breeze caress my cheeks,
Whispering secrets of the night,
Where dreams and realities meld,
And the magic of new beginnings unfolds.

In this embrace of daylight,
I find my spirit rekindled,
Connected to the pulse of nature,
A thread woven through all that lives,
Here, in the dawnâ€™s tender glow,
I rediscover my purpose.

- Ettore Cozzani
