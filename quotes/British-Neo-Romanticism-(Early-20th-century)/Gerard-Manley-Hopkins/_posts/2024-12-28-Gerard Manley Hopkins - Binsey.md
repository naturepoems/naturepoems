Binsey Poplars

Gone, gone again, you are up and down as the trees,
  The trembling poplars, quiet above the earth rising.
Each shape sways alone as the dark calls, and
  Down wander in chaos till full of echoes all as tree-won ease.

  O where, who could release youâ€”
  These hush, these hurts caused by this swirl!

O dissipated dust, you lost out just as sun lies,
  Sweat torn and bruised, lay these shadows there.

Forever our heart breaks for these small things,
  But sense this flush and warmth of earth, saying, "Return!"

O all you sighting, more than passing sky,
  You show the love of these lost trees, compelled to fly.

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
