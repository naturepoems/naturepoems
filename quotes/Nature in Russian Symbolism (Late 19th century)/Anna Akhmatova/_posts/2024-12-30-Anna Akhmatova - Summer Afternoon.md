In the midst of a summer's golden afternoon,
The fields stretch out, vast and serene,
Each blade of grass a whisper of joy,
As nature sings in a harmonious scene.

The bees hum softly, collecting their gold,
While the sun weaves warmth through the trees,
In this sanctuary of light and life,
I feel the essence of purest peace.


- Anna Akhmatova
