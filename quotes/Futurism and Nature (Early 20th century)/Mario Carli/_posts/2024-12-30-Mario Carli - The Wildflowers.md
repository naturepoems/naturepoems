The Wildflowers
In fields untouched, wildflowers bloom,
A riot of colors, a joyous shout,
Each petal unique, a story of the earth,
Dancing in the wind's soft breath,
They sway and nod, a gentle chorus,
Celebrating life in unison,
Their roots tethered in the soil,
Yet reaching for the sky,
A symbol of resilience,
Thriving amidst the wild,
Nature's exquisite artistry,
A fleeting moment of beauty,
Here today, gone tomorrow,
But never forgotten.


- Mario Carli
