Dover Beach

The sea is calm tonight.
The tide is full, the moon lies fair
Upon the straits; on the French coast the light
Glimmers and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,
Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.

Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!
Only, from the long line of spray
Where the sea meets the moon-blanched land,
Listen! you hear the grating roar
Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,
At their return, up the high strand,
Begin, and cease, and then again begin,
With tremulous cadence slow, and bring
The eternal note of sadness in.

Sophocles long ago
Heard it on the Aegean, and it brought
Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow
Of human misery; we find also
In the sound a thought, hearing it by this moonlight,
But one that is not ours, not human;â€“
Along with it, the loss of beauty,
We reflect on the whispering winds and waves,
Yet we cannot find
What knowledge of happiness flows,
Its pride, its beauty.

So too, we sail through life apart,
And the whispering rush of waves along;
We search for shores that shine grand apart;
Ah, can we meet? Spread clear! Grieve and dance along.

Therefore, we shall always miss the way;
We hear the water, and the moon, and sigh,
Resistance holds firm, on that sea smooth and gray.
Across the night we seek it, hidden high.

- Matthew Arnold
