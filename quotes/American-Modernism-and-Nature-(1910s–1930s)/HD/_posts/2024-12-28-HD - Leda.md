Leda

The wood is full of the song 
of widows;  
the night is long.  
The swooning of the wreath,  
the fallen leaves,  
the falling  
shadows in the gloom—all of these 
your hands are made of.

Thou art beautiful, phantasy.  
I welcome the taste of thee  
like a firefly lighting the dusk,  
it shall not cease, goddess of the night!

So do I tell your kernel up!  
You’re marrow-thick—yet all my strength  
yet waned and wasted—the word  
of Leda lingers of flight,  
imprisoned above the ascents!

You shall go beneath the swan  
kissing the breast;  
years flow,  
here am I, and you!  

Breathe of the wolf  
of the night  
that lies;  
yet every heart is estranged  
by the scent of the blood.
