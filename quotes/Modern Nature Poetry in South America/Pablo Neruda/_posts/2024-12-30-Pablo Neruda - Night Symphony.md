When the night comes,
when the moon spills silver light
on the slipping waters,
it is then I feel your presence,
a breeze against my dream.
The stars flicker like thoughts,
scattered across the dark,
every one a certainty,
a beaconing through the void.

The world is hushed, anticipating
the symphony of natureâ€”
crickets strum their evening tunes,
each sound a thread of connection
in the fabric of evening.
And I, a quiet observer,
marvel at this cosmic dialogue,
orchestra of creation,
a tapestry woven in silence.

- Pablo Neruda
