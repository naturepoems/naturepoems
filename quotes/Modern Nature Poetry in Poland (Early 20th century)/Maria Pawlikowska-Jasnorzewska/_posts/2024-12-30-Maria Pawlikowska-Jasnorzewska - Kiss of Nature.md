The earth is waiting for your kiss
like a fresh flower in spring.
Without you I am nothing.
The sun has forgot its warmth,
only the rain remembers.

And when the summer comes,
I will run to you, bare feet
through the green fields, blinded
by the light of your love.
I will harvest the scent of the earth,
carry it in my heart until then.

Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
