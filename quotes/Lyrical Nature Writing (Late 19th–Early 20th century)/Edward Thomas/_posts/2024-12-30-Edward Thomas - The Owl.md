The Owl

When all the world was in bed,
I heard a call, clear and precise,
A great horned owl above my head,
With eyes like lamps, and fierce advice.

"Hoo-hoo!" it cried, through the night,
A sound both mournful and profound,
While shadows danced in moonlight bright,
The woods alive with waiting sounds.

In those moments, silence reigned,
The earth so still, life hung suspended,
An ancient song, by time uncontained,
In the heart of night, a voice extended.


- Edward Thomas
