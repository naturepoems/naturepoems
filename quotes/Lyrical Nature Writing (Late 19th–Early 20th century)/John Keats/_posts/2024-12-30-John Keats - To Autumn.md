Where are the songs of spring? Ay, where are they?
Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;

Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
Among the river sallows, borne aloft
Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from their hilly bourne;

Hedge-crickets sing; and now with trampled wings
Near him, like flying toads, the swallows fly;
And he, he saw the sunset as it sings
To raise the veil of night and in the sky.

But I not know them, it ripens too late.
And there’s no joy to take away that fate.

— *To Autumn*

- John Keats
