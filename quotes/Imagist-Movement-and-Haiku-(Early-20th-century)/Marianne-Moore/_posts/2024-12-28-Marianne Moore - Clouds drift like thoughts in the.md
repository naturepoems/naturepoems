quote: "Clouds drift like thoughts in the mind,
orphaned by the breeze, they shimmer,
a gliding fleet across the blue,
shadows playing hide and seek,
a dance of light framed by nature's arms,
as the horizon blushes at their passing."

Clouds drift like thoughts in the mind,
orphaned by the breeze, they shimmer,
a gliding fleet across the blue,
shadows playing hide and seek,
a dance of light framed by nature's arms,
as the horizon blushes at their passing.

- Marianne Moore
