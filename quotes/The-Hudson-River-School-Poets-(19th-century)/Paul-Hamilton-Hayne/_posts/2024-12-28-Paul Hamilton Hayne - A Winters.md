A Winter's Evening

The forest wraps in silence deep,
As hoar-frost laces leaf and tree,
And in the hush of dusk I creep,
To share the awe of twilightâ€™s plea.

Embrace the world in crystal white,
While moons awaken stars above,
And hear the heart of winter's night
In stillness, echoing love.

- Paul Hamilton Hayne
