The Battle of Lovell's Pond

In the quiet of the forest glades,  
The battle rages—silent, bold;  
Nature's fury, pain cascades,  
With colors red, and stories told.

The sun beats down on the glade of green,  
As blossomed flowers sway and dance;  
Amid the splendor, the unseen  
Whispers of war and of chance.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
