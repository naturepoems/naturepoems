THE VINE IN THE VILLAGE
The vine, the vine, how it runs,  
A green river  
Winding down the hillside  
Thickening with light.  

The village is there,  
With the children and their mothers,  
And the vine is their story.  
They have played and talked  
Under its shade  
Until it is part of them.  

Their laughter rises.  
Like birds lifting from the leaves,  
Seeking the sun.  
Yet the vine still holds  
Their secrets,  
Leaves falling softly.  


- Bessie Head
