On the Coast

The rugged coast, where sea meets land,
  And cliffs of granite rise,
Where every wave with lusty hand
  The tempest boldly tries.

The winds of heaven toss the foam,
  And screeching gulls take flight;
This is the wild sea’s oaken home,
  A strong and fierce delight.

The caverns carved in nature’s stone
  Keep secrets deep and old;
A mournful tale of hearts alone,
  Remembered and retold.

But in the calm that follows storm,
  When quietude returns,
The tide, in gentle, yielding form,
  A silent beauty yearns.

So let the storms of life withstand,
  I’ll love this dark embrace;
For in the storm I understand—
  I find my truest place.
