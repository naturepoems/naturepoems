A Leaf

O clean-cut leaf,  
O pure white paper,  
And you hold the power  
To breathe and share,  
To thrice undo the life  
That trails as fine webs  
Of burgeoning doubt.

Upon your veins,  
Mirrors of the soul,  
You scatter laughter,  
You absorb the light  
And unfurl my breath's lullabies—  
To cherish nature’s moan  
Deep in your green secret.

— D.H. Lawrence
