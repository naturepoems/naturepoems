GREEN MIRAGE

In the heart of the deep forest, green,
Where shadows dance in sun-drenched glade,
There lies an ether, serene, unseen,
An essence where sweet secrets are laid.

Each breath a melody, wild and pure,
The rustling leaves sing beneath the sun,
With every step, the paths allure,
In nature's arms, we become as one.


- Edna Saint Vincent Millay
