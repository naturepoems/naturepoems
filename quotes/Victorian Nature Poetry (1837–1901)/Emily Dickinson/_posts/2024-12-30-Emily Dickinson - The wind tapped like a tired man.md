---

The wind tapped like a tired man,  
And like a friend, I greet,  
And bid it to a seat;  
By the busy road, we sit,  
And share a word worth saying.  

Then he rifle — as old friend —  
Could lose an ear, without a care,  
For all the world — is fine —  
When Nature pays her due —  
Of golden Hour.  


- Emily Dickinson
