O thou who pours the rainy day!
The dark and dreary heart,
Though clouds may gather and skies may darken,
The sun shall pierce them yet.

Though I be not where thou art,
Guide my sad steps alone,
Till thy sweet light and my heart rise,
Here like a flower unblown.

O bring me in the light of day,
When winds and oceans ceaseless roam;
And golden waves, wife in their play,
With lulling whispers, call me home.

- Robert Burns
