The Earth

Every night, beneath my window, something stirs.
A rustle breaks through the dense shadow,
Black water spills from the hallowing stones;
And the air spills close against my face,
Almost unheard, as it gropes for stars, weeping.
I listen to the earth—she sounds
Too much—to our years—too meek,
But in her arms, on the benches,
The fallen leaves rest, quiet in sleep, unnoticed.
