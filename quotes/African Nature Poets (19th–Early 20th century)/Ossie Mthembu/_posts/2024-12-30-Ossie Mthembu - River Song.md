River Song

The river flows with grace,
Glistening under the sun,
A silver ribbon weaves,
Through the heart of the land.

Its gentle murmur and play,
Call to the fish below,
Whispers of love and life,
In an endless ebb and flow.

Oh, how it dances,
With the rocks and the reeds,
Carving stories in silence,
For the heart that listens heeds.

- Ossie Mthembu
