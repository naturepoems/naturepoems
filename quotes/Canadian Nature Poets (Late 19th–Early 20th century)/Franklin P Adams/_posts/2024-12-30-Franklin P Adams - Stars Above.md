Stars Above

At night the stars like diamonds gleam,
A wondrous tapestry, a dream,
They light the sky with silent grace,
And fill our hearts with a warm embrace.

In nature’s hush, they seem to call,
Reminding us of life’s great thrall,
That in the cosmos, we are one,
Beneath the same, unyielding sun.


- Franklin P Adams
