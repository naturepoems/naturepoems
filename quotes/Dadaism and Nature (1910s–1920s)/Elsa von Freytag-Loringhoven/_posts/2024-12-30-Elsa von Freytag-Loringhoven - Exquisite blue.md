Exquisite blue
   ignites the polar winds;
   tripping under black hooves
   the bright-crowned dewdrop spills,
   weaving sound from brimstone,
   as cool aroma lashes
   against fragile skins.
   Plunge deeper!
   Through thistles imprisoned.
   Eden shall emerge<br>
   soft as shadows, come, 
   wiser, constellating dust!

- Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven
