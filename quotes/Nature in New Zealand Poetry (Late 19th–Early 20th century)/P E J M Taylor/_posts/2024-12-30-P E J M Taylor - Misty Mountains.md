Misty Mountains

In the dawn's embrace, the mountains rise,  
Veiled in a cloak of misty lies,  
Their peaks like sentinels stand so proud,  
Whispers of silence wrapped in a shroud.

The sun's first touch, a gentle caress,  
Awakens the world in its soft finesse,  
Nature's symphony begins to play,  
As shadows dance with the light of day.

Majestic, eternal, they hold the key,  
To the heart of our land, wild and free,  
In the breath of the air and the rustle of leaves,  
The spirit of nature forever weaves.

- P E J M Taylor
