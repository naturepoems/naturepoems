In the Forest

Deep in the forests, where silence sings,  
And the air is filled with the scent of things,  
The ancient trees, so tall and wise,  
Recount the tales of time and skies.  

Their roots intertwine with the earth below,  
As time drifts softly, like a slow-flowing brook,  
Each whisper carries the thoughts of the past,  
In this sacred space where shadows are cast.  

The green leaves flutter, and branches sway,  
In tune with the night and the break of day;  
Listen close to the secrets they share,  
For nature speaks, and she’s always there.  

The dance of the wind, the call of the night,  
Holds the magic of life—pure delight.

- E J Brady
