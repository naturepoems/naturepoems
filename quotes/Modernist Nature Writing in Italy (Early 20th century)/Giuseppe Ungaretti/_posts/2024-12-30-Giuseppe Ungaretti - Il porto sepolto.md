Il porto sepolto

         The port lies buried,
         Sinking in the glimmer of the sea,  
         Where the tides whisper,
         Murmuring lengthening tides.  
         The sky-stroking vapors of fog  
         Conceal the embodiment of silence.  
         I look for new waves  
         To shape the forms.  
         
        
          
          


- Giuseppe Ungaretti
