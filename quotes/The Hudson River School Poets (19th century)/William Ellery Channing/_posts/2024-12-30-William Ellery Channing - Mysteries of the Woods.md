The woods are full of mysteries,  
Of shadows deep, and songs of birds,  
Each echo carries ancient tales,  
Beyond the reach of mortal words.  

Tall pines stand guard, their spirits high,  
While sunlight spills on leafy beds,  
And streams, like silver ribbons, flow,  
Through ancient paths that wisdom treads.

- William Ellery Channing
