The twilight beckons with its gentle sigh,
And the stars appear in a velvet sky,
Each glimmer, a spark of hope anew,
In this quiet moment, life feels true.

Breathe in the night, let it fill your lungs,
With the songs of the world in a thousand tongues.
Oh, dear nature, you are always near,
In the stillness of night, I hold you dear.

- Henry David Thoreau
