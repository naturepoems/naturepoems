Defying the chaos, it stands so warm.
In its fragile strength, nature's voice calls,
Resilience blooms where the soft rain falls."

A lone flower blooms in the midst of a storm,
Defying the chaos, it stands so warm.
In its fragile strength, nature's voice calls,
Resilience blooms where the soft rain falls.
