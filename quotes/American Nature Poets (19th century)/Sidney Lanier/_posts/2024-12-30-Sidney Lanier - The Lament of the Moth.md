The Lament of the Moth

Before the fire, I flutter and roam,
With flitting dreams I know them all—
In circles soft, I rise from my home,
To the orange blow of the fire’s thrall.

Each ember starts, and the flame, it seems, 
Beckons my light towards the end,
Yet I am drawn with all my dreams,
To the radiant warmth I dare to tend.
—Sidney Lanier
