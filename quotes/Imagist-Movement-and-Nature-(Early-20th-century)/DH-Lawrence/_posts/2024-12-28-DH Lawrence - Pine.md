Pine Trees
  
Pine trees against the sky,
Willing the winds to come.
The sun glances off their needles,
And I am out in the cool rush
Of the wild space.

The scent of resin in the air,
A sharp, clean smell,
Lifting to me from the ground
Where the forest is alive,
Renewal of earth and sky all embracing.

It hums and crackles with life,
In this great stillness,
To sit and listen is to be
A part of the breath of this world.

                         - DH Lawrence
