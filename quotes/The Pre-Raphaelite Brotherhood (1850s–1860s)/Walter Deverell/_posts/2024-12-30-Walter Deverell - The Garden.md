THE GARDEN

Oh for a garden to be mine—a sacred space  
Where flowers bloom and scents do dance like dreams,  
The sun will brush my cheek in warm embrace,  
While leafy boughs provide the softest seams.  
And in that place, the spirit quietly beams,  
In nature's vanity, repose I take,  
To blend with earth's embracing, tender themes,  
To linger by the waters, watch the lake.


- Walter Deverell
