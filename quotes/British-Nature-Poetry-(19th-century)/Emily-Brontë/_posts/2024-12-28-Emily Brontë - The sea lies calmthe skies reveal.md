The sea lies calm—the skies reveal  
A tranquil hue to comfort mine,
The lifted edge of each vast peel  
Where tide and fate resumptively twine.

O, tread ye lightly by my sight,
For nature speaks in beauty bold,
The earth unveils her pure delight  
With whispers soft and stories told.


- Emily Brontë
