fifth of the rain 
the flower bids goodnight 
in the dark chasm 
of a leaf  

it dreamed, 
I am a cloud, 
that summer woke 
but all they see  
is the head of a cactus 
digging into the rustling 
of the sky and dust.  

through outsized windows and petals, 
your love for me  
wrapped in roots, 
craving the sun.

- Ana Cristina Cesar
