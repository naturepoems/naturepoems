Each in His Prison

Each in his prison, thinking of the stars,
Each in his prison, dreaming of the shore;
We all are bounded, nothing more
Than what our fetters bear:  
We mingle in the moonlit bars
Aline, and there we bow it o’er.

For every fleeting hour aligns
Within the prison’s scope
Yet the great skies we deem align
Within our thoughts of hope.
- Edna St Vincent Millay
