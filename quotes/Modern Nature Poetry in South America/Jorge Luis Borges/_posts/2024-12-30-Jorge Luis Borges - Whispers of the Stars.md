Whispers of the Stars

In the night sky, whispers venture,
Stars conspire like lost dreams,
Forgetting the burdens of the day
And longing for endless tales.

A constellationâ€™s map, drawn
In celestial ink,
Guides the weary heart
To mysteries and wonders untold.

To gaze upwards is to ponder,
The fleeting nature of the soul,
And find peace in the infinity
That wraps us, even if unseen.


- Jorge Luis Borges
