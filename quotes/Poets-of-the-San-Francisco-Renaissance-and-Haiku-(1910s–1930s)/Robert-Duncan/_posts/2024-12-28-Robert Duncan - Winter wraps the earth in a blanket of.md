quote: "Winter wraps the earth in a blanket of white,
Silent snowflakes fall like the breath of dreams,
Every branch, every blade draped in crystal cloaks,
A tranquil stillness blankets the world,
And in this icy embrace, life pauses,
A moment to reflect, to sigh, to inhale the silence."

Winter wraps the earth in a blanket of white,
Silent snowflakes fall like the breath of dreams,
Every branch, every blade draped in crystal cloaks,
A tranquil stillness blankets the world,
And in this icy embrace, life pauses,
A moment to reflect, to sigh, to inhale the silence.
