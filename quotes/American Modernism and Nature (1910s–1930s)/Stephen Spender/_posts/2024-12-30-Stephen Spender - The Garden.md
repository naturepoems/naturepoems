The Garden

In the garden, dusk creeps softly, 
A coy veil draped across the petals—
There, the lilies bow their heads,
And the fragrance swells with longing,
For hidden beneath the leaves lie sighs,
Of all that bursts and blooms with fate—
In this quiet retreat from clamor,
Nature speaks the language of the heart.
