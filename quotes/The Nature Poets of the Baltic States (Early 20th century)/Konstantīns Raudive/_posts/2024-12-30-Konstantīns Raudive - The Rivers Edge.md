The River's Edge

At the river’s edge I linger,
Where the water flows with grace,
Life dances in its currents,
And stories are whispered,
To the stones and the reeds.

Reflections shimmer on the surface,
Mirroring the sky’s embrace,
While dragonflies flit about,
In a play of light and shadow,
Creating magic at each turn.

Time melts into the flow,
As I sit and watch,
The river carries my thoughts,
Into the arms of the vast unknown,
Where all paths converge in silence.

- Konstantīns Raudive
