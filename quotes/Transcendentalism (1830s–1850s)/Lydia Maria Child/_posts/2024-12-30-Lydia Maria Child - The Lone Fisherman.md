THE LONE FISHERMAN

In the stillness of the river,
As night enfolds the land,
The fisherman with quiet mind,
Plays gently with his hand.

He hears the songs of nature's lute,
The ripples sweetly say,
‘There’s peace and joy to be found,
In the gold of the sunset’s ray.’

He baits his hook with faith and hope,
And casts his line afar,
To catch that dream that glimmers bright,
Like a distant star.

With heart attuned to nature’s breath,
He savours every hour,
For in the night sky’s twinkling glow,
He finds his heart’s true power.

- Lydia Maria Child
