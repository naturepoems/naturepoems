Crusoe in England

I  live alone,
down by where the ground
is smoother, by the water’s edge,
yeit still mostly dry as I move about,
find my way slowly through forests,
old trees, broken stones well-marked,
as I adjust to my home where I was cast away,
all runs smoothly,
so simply, slowly moving,
measured out into days.

Just a stone taken from the ground
where the fog is thin,
 I could sit there for hours,
listening as birds return,
for just about all things returned to the air.

I stretched myself as far as I could,
a sea breeze comes,
the open sky —
a deserted mind 
yet clearly alive,
apart of all places,
 and I could watch, so watch it rain.

Yet I miss it,
so near things,
so unknowable in spring,
a bright morning drags on slow,
 send light toward me still!

- Elizabeth Bishop
