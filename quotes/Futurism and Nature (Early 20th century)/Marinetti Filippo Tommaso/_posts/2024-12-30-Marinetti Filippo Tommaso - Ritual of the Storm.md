Ritual of the Storm
Eruptions, flashes of thrumming,  
my soul is the storm’s mouth!

I bind the noise of thunder  
with hitched waves and ruptures,  
i roar like animal veins of sky,  
tongues flailing against blind light!

A chant overhead,  
the raindrops streak along  
as crimson moths strangle daylight!

Let them rain upon me,  
life’s tempest shall possess me  
with its fierce will!

I shall carry winds  
a thousand miles  
of furious chaos,  
a fierce memory!

- Marinetti Filippo Tommaso
