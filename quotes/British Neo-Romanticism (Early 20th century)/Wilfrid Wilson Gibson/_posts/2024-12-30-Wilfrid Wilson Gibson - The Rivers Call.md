The River's Call

By the river bank, where the waters play,
And reeds bend low at the touch of day;
I walked with echoes of distant dreams,
And pondered deep in the water's gleams.

Oh, the river runs with a joyful sound,
A melody sweet, that knows no bound;
With whispers soft that fill the air,
And secrets told in the cool nightâ€™s care.

Each current weaves a tale anew,
Of time that flows and cycles round;
A gift, a bond, in the twilight blue,
In silence deep, a promise found.
