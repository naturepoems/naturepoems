All service ranks the same with God—
The lowest is the highest one,
Theelt, the radiant crowns are wrought—
He upon earth, who does his best,
Will surely reap, in heaven, the rest:
Where, as one grows in goodness, love,
More and more sweetly bloom, above.
For every fruit is but a flower,
The world itself a blooming bower.
In heaven the leaves of trees shall rust,
He wraps his wisdom in a nest,
Each grain of sand within our trust,
And makes the sting of poverty,
The smirk of wealth, a precious thought.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
