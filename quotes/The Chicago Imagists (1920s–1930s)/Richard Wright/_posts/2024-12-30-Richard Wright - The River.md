The river has a tired flow,
It runs beneath the trees that bend
To drink its brown, dark water,
I stand on the bank,
And watch the world fall asleep.

The stars are beginning to come out,
They are yellow and white,
Flickering like silver bees
Dancing over flowers.
The soft wind whispers, and I listen,
In the sleepy woods,
And my dreams run with the river.

- Richard Wright
