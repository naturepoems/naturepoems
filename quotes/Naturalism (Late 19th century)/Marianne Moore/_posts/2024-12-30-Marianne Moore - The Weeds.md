The Weeds
Weeds grow in loose soil  
Like ancient revivals,  
Inside crumbling bricks,  
Dressed in layers of greens,  
In their restless experience  
Of existence.  
As the daisies drown,  
Weeds drift.  
They breathe with the wild spring blooms,  
And with grief, their lusty reach continues.

- Marianne Moore
