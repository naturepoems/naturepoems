The Rain

In the rain, whispers of the sky,
Life’s elixir from clouds drifting by,
Each drop a tune upon my cheek,
A soft reminder, life’s heart speaks.

Kissing the earth with gentle dance,
Stirring the roots to life’s advance,
Oh, sweet rain, caress me low,
In your embrace, my spirit grows.

- DH Lawrence
