Portrait of a Lady

I
Among the smoke and fog of a city,  
The flowers flutter and dance.
The ivy letter sweeps all night, 
And dust and dust come back again.

II
Life is fleeting, caught among the clouds,  
The clouds feel azure and rigid;  
Light hangs unreal, diffused o’er the day:  
And keeping out all sound from the idle pad;  
It tinkles at twilight, as echoes resound.  

III
Yet hearts of men must endure;  
Each voice heard among the shadows calls,  
Affinity close with starry light,  
Know that the age shall still revolve.  

There is no shoreline neglected;  
Yearns can rust in ash —  
But love in endless silence must endure.

Everywhere life beckons us close,  
Proclaiming everywhere the old dance,  
Across the prints of the tide's latest paths  
As stillness plunges to wings or wan.  

Amber shadows draw pools that shroud the day  
In sunshine's halo, round the way.  

Once whole, shadows darkened like the earth and soot  
When fierceness flowed through the intervals of our lives.


- TS Eliot
