Euclid

The angles of space 
Crunch and tumble, 
Through an echo of stars, 
Graph the flame of night,
With shadows in the balance, 
Light takes form—
Geometry we know; 
From starlight to coil,
The swell of an earth song, 
Awaits the breath of dawn,
Geometry in nature's hand.

Let it be written, 
Let it be known—
In the quiet of the woods, 
Held close in the dreams, 
Every measure sings a path, 
In the ordering of fate.
