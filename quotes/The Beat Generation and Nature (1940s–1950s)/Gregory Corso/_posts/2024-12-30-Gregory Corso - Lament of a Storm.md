Lament of a Storm
by Gregory Corso

The skies crack again,
and they fall apart,
a shiver on the fields,
the air filled with charge,
grey heads of clouds
whisper those forgotten souls
tumbling through the lights.
A storm’s lament,
so hard that trees buckle,
a shake in my soul,
all the animals quiver.

Oh how the grasses scream,
the winds laugh, while
the rivers sing,
a gaiety dressed in tragedy,
a random flight with dim stars.
For each storm is music,
nstartled earth moves,
creating chaos mistaken for life,
your beauty shines blue!

- Gregory Corso
