To the Sea

O mighty sea, that draws my heart!
  Within thy depths I yearn—
Where the tempest beats and waves may part,
  Life's lessons I discern.

Thou art the spirit great and free,
  The strength that life requires,
In every storm and calm, I see
  Your world’s ceaseless fires.

To find my peace within your tides,
  Those whispers soft as foam,
To know the depths where silence hides,
  Within your depths, my home.


- Mary Gilmore
