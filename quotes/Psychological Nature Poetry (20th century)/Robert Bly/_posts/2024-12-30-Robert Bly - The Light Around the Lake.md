The Light Around the Lake
It was early spring, the lake slightly misted,
The light around the lake an early reflection.
The trees have opened, their soft petals exposed
To the tender kiss of the sun's wake.
The world a blend of water and land,
A body trembling to breathe.
Such is this gentle season's gift.



- Robert Bly
