The Winter's End
Where every flower was turned to gold,  
And dreams of summers soon have fled;  
Yet in the silence, stories told,  
The seeds of beauty lie ahead.

Let winter melt into a gentle spring,  
As nature beckons with tender hands;  
In the renewal of life, oh sweet rebirth,  
In every garden, destiny stands.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
