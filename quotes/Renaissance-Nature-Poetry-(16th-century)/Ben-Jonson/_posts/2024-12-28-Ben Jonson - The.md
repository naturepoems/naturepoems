The Nightingale
Awake, sweet nightingale, and sing thy tune,
In sighing boughs where evening shadows lie,
For in thy song, I find the perfect boon,
A tender peace beneath the starry sky.

With every note, the world finds its refrain,
While whispers of the breeze lend gentle sighs,
O let thy voice be wild as autumn rain,
In every heart where love abundantly lies.

For when you call upon the night to wake,
The stars embrace the choir of sweet delight,
And I, beneath the hush, my heart shall take,
Each song of nature, woven of your light.

- Ben Jonson
