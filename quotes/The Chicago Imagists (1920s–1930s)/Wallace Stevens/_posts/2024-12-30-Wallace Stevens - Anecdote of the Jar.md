Anecdote of the Jar

I placed a jar in Tennessee,
And round it went, upon a hill.
It made the slovenly wilderness
Surround that hill.

The wilderness rose up to it,
And sprawled around, no longer wild.
The jar was round upon the ground
And tall and of a port in air.

It took dominion everywhere.
The jar was gray and bare.
It did not give of bird or bush,
Like nothing else in Tennessee.

When I naked in a sanctuary,
With flowers around my feet,
I was met with ungraspable ease.
Except that, in forgetfulness,  
I would know the jar as mine,  
And though empty and insufficient,  
It held that unending  
Possibility to expand beyond mere lack,
To take me into larger places.

- Wallace Stevens
