Clouds drift,
    White and free,
Over hills bathed in light.
            When twilight falls,
                     The shadows stretch,
     Each blade of grass,
   Suddenly alive.
The dusk enfolds
        The soft world,
       It breathes as the day
                                   Recalls its end.

- Sylvia Plath
