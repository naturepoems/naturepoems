Where the river meets the sea,
And waves kiss the sandy shore,
The horizon bleeds with colors,
As day yields to night's embrace,
Painting dreams upon the water.

The singsong of the swell,
Calls to those who seek solace,
In the rhythm of the tides,
As stars blink their approval,
In the cosmic dance of time.
