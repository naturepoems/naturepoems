quote: "The river is here  
Lapping against the stones  
Under the poplar  
Full of shadows  
And restless starlings.  

I still hear the thrum  
Of insects singing their  
Daylight songs, their  
Sounds vibrating against  
The cool skin of the air."

The river is here  
Lapping against the stones  
Under the poplar  
Full of shadows  
And restless starlings.  

I still hear the thrum  
Of insects singing their  
Daylight songs, their  
Sounds vibrating against  
The cool skin of the air.
