The Wayward Wind
The wayward wind is calling me,

Through crags and cliffs, o’er land and sea,

It lifts my heart to dance and soar,

Unfolding paths from shore to shore.

With every gust, adventures greet,

A wanderer’s path beneath my feet,

For where the wind may chance to blow,

Lies beauty deeper than we know.

- Richard Jefferies
