Cactus flowers bloom
under a sun like a surprise,
they don’t need 
a fairytale to arrive.
Underneath the desert sprawl,
hope awakens to the sky,
bearing fruits of orange and red,
flavoring the dry.
Their elegance shines bright,
dancing steadfast against the strife
of the barren soil’s constant fight.
Among slumbering rocks,
whispering with sighs,
this pulse of nature persists,
no matter how the land lies.
