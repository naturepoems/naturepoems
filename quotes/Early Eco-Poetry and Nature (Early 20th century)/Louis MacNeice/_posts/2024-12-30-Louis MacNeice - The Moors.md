The Moors

To tread the moors beneath broad skies,
Where heather blooms and eagles soar,
In rugged beauty, wild and free,
Where earth and spirit swell with lore.

Each step releases cosmic echoes,
Every whisper hints a timeless past,
As ancient stones reform with silence,
In nature’s realm, blessed, steadfast.

The falcon’s cry brings purpose clear;
In every breeze, a world reborn,
The moors vibrate with truth and fear,
As shadowy dawn threads through the morn.
—Louis MacNeice
