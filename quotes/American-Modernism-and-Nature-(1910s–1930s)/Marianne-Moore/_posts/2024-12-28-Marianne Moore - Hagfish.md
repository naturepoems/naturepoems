Hagfish

The marvel of crude,
gorgeous creatures, here
at your doorstep, ground, mine.

The chord with the sleekness
and unexpressed texture,
is a salvage,
with chilly longer hair.

And with so guarded a wish —
it shares their consciousness,
the oscillation, the impact.

Its makeup is obsolete,
its exacting summer coat’s abilities,
mellowing down
into primary notes.

Lightly desired, a word
has been bitten into —
nature delights in crab-equals,
a viola to behold,

and swims in life
saw while vocal anour.

Hagfish! A surety against
modern make, sleek,
continuing on august. 

—Marianne Moore
