In the stillness of the night,  
When the stars are shining bright,  
I wander through the fields of dreams,  
Where nature's beauty ever gleams.  
The moonlight dances on the grass,  
Inviting whispers as I pass;  
Each sighing breeze, each rustling leaf,  
Wraps my heart in sweet belief.

- Bessy H Elliott
