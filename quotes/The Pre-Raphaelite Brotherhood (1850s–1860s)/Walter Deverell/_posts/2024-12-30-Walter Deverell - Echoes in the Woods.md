ECHOES IN THE WOODS

Beside the brook where silver ripples play,  
The whispers of the trees call sweetly low;  
Their leaves like laughter, twinkle in the day,  
While shadows linger soft, where night does go.  
Each step you take, the forest seems to know,  
And every echo carries forth a sigh,  
Nature’s secrets, in the heart of trees, let flow,  
As if the woods in silent bliss reply.


- Walter Deverell
