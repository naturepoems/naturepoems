What song can heaven sing
To rouse your tender sway?
When evening’s colors cling,
To dreams that lie in clay?  

A nightingale, like breath,
Shall carry us afloat,
In whispers ripe with depth,
While shadows cast a boat,

That sails on starry seas,
With you as my bright muse.
Tell me, oh gentle breeze,
Your essence, I choose. 


- Robert Graves
