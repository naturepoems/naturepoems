Sowing Seeds

As I dig my hands in the earth,
a promise surfaces,
a cycle history resurrected.

Each seed cradled in my palm,
telling the story of life
that unfolds in the soil,
dreams carried by the winds.

We sow not only for our harvest,
but for the future,
planting hope in every corner
where the soil meets the sky.
