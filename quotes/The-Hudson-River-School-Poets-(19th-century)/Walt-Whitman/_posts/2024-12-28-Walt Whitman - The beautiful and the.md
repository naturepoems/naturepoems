The beautiful and the free,
The sun on the river, the reeds high and green,
The warmth of the sun through the leaves,
As a balm on my spirit sate me.

I become one with the soil and the storm,
And the whispers of the river that run,
For every thing that lives,
From the tiniest bug to the mountain so high,

Is a part of me, and I am its song,
Its voice here on earth, hidden no more,
For the joy of belonging to nature will bring me,
The peace I have sought, the love I adore.

â€” From "Leaves of Grass"

- Walt Whitman
