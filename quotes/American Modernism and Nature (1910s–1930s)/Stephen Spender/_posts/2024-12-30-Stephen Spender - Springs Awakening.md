Spring's Awakening

Spring arrives on quiet feet,
With the chirps and croons of awakened birds—
I find my heart racing with possibility,
As petals unfurl from slumbering buds,
The heartbeats of trees—all join in song,
In the golden light of reawakening life,
For each day, a reminder of resilience,
And the beauty that thrives in the softest touch.
