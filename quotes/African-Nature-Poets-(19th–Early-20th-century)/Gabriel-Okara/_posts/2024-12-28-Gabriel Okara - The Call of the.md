The Call of the River
The river calls me sweetly,
Its silver laughter dancing,
As it winds its way,
Like a whisper in the soft dusk,
Enticing my heart to follow.
Through tangled weeds and copious leaves,
It beckons with tales untold,
Of ages past wrapped in the folds
Of the dancing waters' embrace.
My soul longs to dive in,
To be cradled by the current,
Wrapped in the ancient murmurs,
Lost in the rhythm of nature's song.




- Gabriel Okara
