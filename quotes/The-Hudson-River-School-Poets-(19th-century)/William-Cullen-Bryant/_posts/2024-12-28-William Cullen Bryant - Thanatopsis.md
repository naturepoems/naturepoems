Thanatopsis

To him who in the love of Nature holds
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
A various language; for his gayer hours
She has a voice of gladness and a smile
And eloquence of beauty; and she glides
Into his darker musings, with a mild
And healing sympathy, that steals away
Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight
Over thy spirit, and sad images
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and grave,
O take thy shield against them; for, alway
The mind is its own place, and in itself
Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven:
To the pure, all things are pure: to the foul,
All things are foul. That is the era of thee,
When, thy light, stands the sun.

- William Cullen Bryant
