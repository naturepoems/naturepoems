The meadow spreads in beauty wide,  
Where dappled light and shadow play;  
Where wildflowers bloom on every side,  
And sweetly scents the summer day.

The sky is blue, the sun is bright,  
The world is full of joy and cheer,  
And all creation's in delight  
When nature's beauty doth appear.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
