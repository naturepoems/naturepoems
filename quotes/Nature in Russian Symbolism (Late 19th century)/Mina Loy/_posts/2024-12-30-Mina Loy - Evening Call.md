Evening Call
Who waits for twilight and its bare will?
Across corridors of swinging palms
and shadows going home,
Child of dusk; set foot on stones,
let small clouds pass your dreams
to sleep on after tones —
Dripping the echo under the thick silken light,
you arbour dust ’til the breath upholds,
create music to hold, the crickets’ swell
how slowly treads the dusk and all around 
is waiting soft — for nature and refrain.


- Mina Loy
