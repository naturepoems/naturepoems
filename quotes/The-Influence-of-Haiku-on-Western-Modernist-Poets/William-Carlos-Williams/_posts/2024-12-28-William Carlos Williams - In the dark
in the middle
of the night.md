quote: "In the dark
in the middle
of the night, a roadsign
flashes, shining.

Above it a sparrow
is caught in the rain,
dipping low, dipping high,
each plum of color
image of echoing melody."

In the dark
in the middle
of the night, a roadsign
flashes, shining.

Above it a sparrow
is caught in the rain,
dipping low, dipping high,
each plum of color
image of echoing melody.

- William Carlos Williams
