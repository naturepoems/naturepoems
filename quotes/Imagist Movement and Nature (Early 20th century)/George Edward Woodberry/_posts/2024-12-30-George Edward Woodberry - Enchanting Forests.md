Ah, me! the forests, wide and vast,
Where echoes wander into space,
And beauty touches, sweet and fast,
The heart of nature, keeps its grace.

Upon the dusk, a peaceful song,
In sylvan glades where flowers unfold,
Where time in silence flows along,
And life sits still, bright dreams enfold.

- George Edward Woodberry
