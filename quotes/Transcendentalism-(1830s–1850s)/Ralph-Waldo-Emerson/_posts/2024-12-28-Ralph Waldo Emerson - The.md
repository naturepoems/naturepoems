The Prelude

   In the garden where the rose and lily grow,
   Passion breezes over sweet fruits, and silence hangs low.
   Turning leaves weave wisdom in every thud,
   As the warm sun casts out the clouds like a flood.

   Here wisdom, soft and warm, lifts the mind from strife,
   And speaks in the language of the unspoiled life.

                                               —Ralph Waldo Emerson
