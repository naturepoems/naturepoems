Dew-kissed mornings, where sunlight breaks clear,
A symphony of birdsong, the song of the year;
In the cradle of spring, life awakens anew,
As blooms burst like laughter, in colors so true.

The fragrance of blossoms, the thrill of the breeze,
In the warmth of the sun, the heart's gentle ease;
Through gardens and woods, my spirit takes flight,
In nature's embrace, I have found my delight.

- David Jones
