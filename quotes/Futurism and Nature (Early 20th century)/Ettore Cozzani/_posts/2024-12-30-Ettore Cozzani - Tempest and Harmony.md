A tempest in the sky,
Thunder like the drums of war,
Lightning slashing through—
Nature's furious battle cry,
Yet in chaos, there's harmony,
The rhythm of the storm,
Playing the earth’s anthem.

Rivers swell and rejoice,
Their laughter mingling with the rain.
Mountains stand resolute,
Guardians of time and space,
Witnesses to this frenetic dance,
Where life emerges anew,
In the wake of nature’s fury.

As clouds disperse,
Painting vivid strokes of blue,
The world breathes again,
And in the quiet aftermath,
Growth surges in the stillness,
The beauty of rebirth,
A promise wrapped in green.

- Ettore Cozzani
