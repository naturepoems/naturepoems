author: Robert Duncan
quote: "The river’s song flows softly through the valley,
A melody woven in the hearts of those who listen,
Its waters reflecting the rhythm of life,
As they dance over stones, glistening in light,
Guiding us along the journey of time,
A connection to all that is fleeting and eternal."

The river’s song flows softly through the valley,
A melody woven in the hearts of those who listen,
Its waters reflecting the rhythm of life,
As they dance over stones, glistening in light,
Guiding us along the journey of time,
A connection to all that is fleeting and eternal.
