Ode to a Nightingale
My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
But being too happy in thine happiness,—
That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees
In some melodious plot
Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,
Singest of summer in full-throated ease.

O for a draught of vintage! that hath been
Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,
Tasting of Flora and the country green,
Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!—
O for a beaker full of the warm South,
Full of the wine of life, and summer's mirth!

This house hath been a long time a grave,
And its dark corners echo like the voids,
Through which nothing human will ever save.
Life, amidst beauty, weaves the fates she avoids.

Eagerly, standing amidst the quiet trees,
I hold my breath to hear that true song start,
She breaks the lot in resurrections, yes, the glees...
Oh, lonely nights, we are never truly apart.


- John Keats
