The daisies dance in fields of gold,  
And twilight whispers sweet and low;  
In the embrace of twilight’s hold,  
The peaceful dreams of night shall flow.

Leave all your troubles with the sun,  
Let every care drift far away;  
In nature’s solace, we are one,  
In life’s gentle arms, we wish to stay.

- A E Housman
