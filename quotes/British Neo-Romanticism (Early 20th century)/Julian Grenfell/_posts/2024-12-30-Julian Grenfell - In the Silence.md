In the Silence
In silence deep, I find my peace,
A moment carved from endless time,
Where nature weaves a sweet release,
And echoes flow in silent rhyme.
For in this stillness, worlds collide,
As nature breathes and softly calls,
A symphony where hearts abide,
Within her grace, the spirit falls.



- Julian Grenfell
