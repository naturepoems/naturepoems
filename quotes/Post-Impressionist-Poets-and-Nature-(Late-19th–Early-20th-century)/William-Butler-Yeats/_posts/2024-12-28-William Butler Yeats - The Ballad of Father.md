The Ballad of Father Gilligan
The pious birds are at their nest,
In the moonlight I hear them winging,
And it crept in so quietly,
A patient thrumming I hear them singing.
And gathers with them at my chamber,
And  bids me stretch and soar.
Yet I wake by the shuning dew,
Not free, not a flower, but saddled by lore.

It yet tracks me in life, unaccounted for,
Ideals cried out for sharpening stored
While I seek love with the winter’s eagle
Some hidden heart grows so adored.

Fair the sunshine through the silent glass
Gratefully gived a glorious weight.
A bed of vines, a formed vast pass,
Of Jesus and the Past is fated.

- William Butler Yeats
