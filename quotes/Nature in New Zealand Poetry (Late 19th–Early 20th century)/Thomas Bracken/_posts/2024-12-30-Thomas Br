The Winter

In winter’s grasp, the world lies still,
With icy breath, the winds arise;
Yet beauty wraps the vale and hill,
With sparkling jewels in the skies.

Though days are short, the night holds sway,
A quiet peace enfolds the lands;
For in this time, the heart can play,
In dreams as soft as silken bands.


- Thomas Bracken
