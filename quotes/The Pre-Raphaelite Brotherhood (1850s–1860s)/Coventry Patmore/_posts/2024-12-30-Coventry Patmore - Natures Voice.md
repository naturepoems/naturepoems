Whence brought this leafy story down,
The river made another meal.
Who speaks from the echoing morning,
Those voices dear, grand, and real?

If from the spark caught in courses wild,
Then shall we rise as one untamed,
And with the heat fly round, beguiled,
Ere our hours should be blamed

- Coventry Patmore
