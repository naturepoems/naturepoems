The Owl

When the cathedral bell strikes at one,  
And the Eve is done,  
I shall pray no longer in vain;  
I shall set my will free, gently gaining  
Awareness of passing through night for she.  
With wings of the owl  
And tapping of toes  
Upon the edge of the earth, I shall vow  
To comfort the living out of their woes.  

The light, softly quick,  
Coupled with dreams,  
Come blessing and passing, removed from the seas  
I rise on the hair of each sigh  
And learn of inventing as stars sky.  
And gentle as those that still seek  
Takes love in the hush of the deep.  

I shall care for the world as a whole;  
Rest easy, dear one, for I am full!  
As I haven’t to leave you tonight,  
I will trust all there’s light before me in flight.

- Edward Thomas
