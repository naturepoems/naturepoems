Pike

    I

    The pike, a predator, swims swift under the shallows,
    Slipping through the weeds, like a ghost in the darkness.
    Their eyes fix upon the world above, hungry,
    Waiting to strike, to thrust on the flesh of other beings.

    II

    From soft flesh to flailing heart, they consume; 
    Nature’s raw violence captures my spirit.
    I felt it then, my own hunger heightening,
    Rune-like glimmers dancing prideful in their wake.

    III

    Yet the pike never forces a self-regard,
    Eel-slippery in the green-black waters, it knows 
    No mercy, as it screams a grave to life,
    Forever captured by the cycle of predation.

    IV

    I see my shadow float in dark repose,
    My heart pounding to the ghostly edges of darkness,
    Will I too be driven to seek? 
    The waters remain still, a promise betrayed by fins.
