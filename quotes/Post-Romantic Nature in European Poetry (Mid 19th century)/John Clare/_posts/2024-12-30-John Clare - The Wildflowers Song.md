The Wildflower's Song

There is a flower that blooms in strange
And lonely places; it is mine,
And not a flower in the whole world owes
Its life to the distant sun like mine.

Oh, how it blooms in dark and dreary
Hollows, bright and sweet, undimmed,
Where not a human footstep wanders,
But the lonely hare and the timid wild.

In the solitude it breathes, a joy
That none can know but I; its life,
A glimmering voice in silence, speaks
To me alone of nature's strife.

O wildflower! treasure of hidden woe,
Beauty of despair, thy dusky hue
And absence make thy charm, and so
I love thee still, and I love but you.

- John Clare
