Spring Pools
These pools that, though in forest dim,
No water shimmers in the bottom,
But rather hold a shadowy fun,
In which the sun rolls down to run
And circle back to climb again.

The forest's walls protecting steep
Straight to the edge and, like the deep,
So spring pools wash upon the shore
And make long thoughts, as if to say,
Come, watch the moss grow in the green,
As flow of life down there is seen.

- Robert Frost
