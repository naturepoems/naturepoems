Spring and All

By the road to the contagious hospital
under the surge of the blue

mottled clouds

around the bend

and the wind crumbs

no trees 

are there.

I have finished your paintings

all the blackness

and the empty arms.

What comes next?

To creep through winter’s night

and give

Spring to the shaking

pale green shade.

Legion of the woodchuck

and weakling far blooms

concerning the laughter

of the world.

The lonely feeds.

How there is love

in the land returns

we will be

here again.

Spring will come.

And we will live!

I remember now,

how quickly remains

the sunPainted spirit.  

That is, to cleave each of our days

thorough space to this

and greenness.

Flesh on the Earth.

- William Carlos Williams
