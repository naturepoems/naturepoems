---

Within a garden, calm and sweet,
Where silence reigns, and echoes fleet,
The whispering leaves in evening's breath—
Embody every hope and death.
Among the petals dew-awake,
I pass the river’s gentle wake
Where shadows dance on water’s mirror,
And softest whispers reach the hearer.

Oh Nature, ever-wise and kind,
Your cheeks adorned by blooms so blind,
I linger, lost, to wander through,
And like the moth drawn to the dew.
In tender hues, the world is bare,
And time slips free like fragrant air,
Embracing twinkling light and shade—
In Nature’s arms, my heart is laid.

- Dora Carrington
