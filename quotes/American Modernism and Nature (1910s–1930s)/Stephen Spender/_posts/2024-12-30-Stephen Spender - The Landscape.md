The Landscape

In the summer of 1915 I sat
In the shade of an oak tree, my heart full of
The familiar ache of love, and the sun must have
Been bright because in death it made me feel
Alive, yet how far it was to follow, how far
To follow the veins in the leaves and the marble,
Bearing on my shoulders the weight of the hours
Delighting in its coolness. But now the foliage,
The oaks, the distant hills all weep beneath
The touch of time while I, still loving,
Call out to the spectres of my past—those
Endless sensations in the lap of the world.
