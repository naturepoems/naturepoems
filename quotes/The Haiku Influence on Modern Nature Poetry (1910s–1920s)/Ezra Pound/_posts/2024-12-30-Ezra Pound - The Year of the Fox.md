The Year of the Fox
The year of the fox is upon us;
    Will there be no quiet stillness 
        To pave the way to the leaves,  
As forgetting glances?
                    You with the blazing bar 
    Of pother in the burnt hazel; 
For the soft wind breathing, 
     To wrap in shadows, 
   O HRipsime—this is the year,
The hat that will keep; 
   The tree that breaks away.
     The leaf that was there.
This year,  
           Wrought with your hands.

- Ezra Pound
