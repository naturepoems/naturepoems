Mountain Trail

High above the valley floor,
The rugged peaks touch the sky,
Where the clouds embrace the summit,
And the eagles dare to fly.

Every step a whispered promise,
Every stone a tale to tell,
As I wander on this pathway,
Nature's beauty casts its spell.

The pines stand tall, sentinels,
Guarding secrets of the wild,
While the streams sing to the boulders,
Of a world both fierce and mild.

In the majesty of mountains,
I find my spirit grows,
For in their quiet presence,
Life's true essence overflows.

- John Thompson
