I remain with you,
In the moon's knowing glance,
As tides pull slow hands from shore.
The warmth of the ocean breeze wraps,
Around our fingertips—
Can you hear the whispers?
Air so sweet, washes my senses,
While stars flicker as gems in a tapestry,
Legacies of sunlight once fruitful
Are here, anchored
At the leaves of life.
Bathe in the silver glow,
As I am healed from memories,
The grief of distance flickering away,
In the silhouette of this celestial embrace.

- Mina Loy
