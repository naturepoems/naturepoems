In the Wild
In woodland deep and willow glen,

Where silence reigns and echoes blend,

The quietude, the inner peace,

Brings balm to souls that seek release.

Here nature talks in whispers soft,

In rustling leaves and breezes aloft,

Here I find a world, untouched, so bright,

Wrapped in a golden cloak of light.

- Richard Jefferies
