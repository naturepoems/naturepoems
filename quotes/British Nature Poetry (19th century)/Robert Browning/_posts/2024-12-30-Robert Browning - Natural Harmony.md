There’s a great deal to be said for immorality,
When you’re young and rife with nature fair,
Your youth and beauty grieving at leisure,
Casting off bonds of time to the wild air.  
But when the evening light is low,
And the soft stars wink clear from infinite space,
The charm of natural peace ignites new wisdom,
Of a life in harmony, and no waste of grace.  
The woods invite a stroll, the meadows call,
To breathe deep of the scented air,
Finding paradise among the green,
It’s a chance to experience a world fair.

- Robert Browning
