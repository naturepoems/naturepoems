I am, as you are, nought but an unkind reed;
An ego born of nought, no rich tenor, nor key,
Assumed in dim, now dusk, nor loose eternity,
To hang around with joy, the strangling missive that we heed.

The birds of evening stamp their fibres from on high,
It is a dream, a thread where visions plunge and fall;
What we ought, and wearied sigh, some bitter fate enthralls,
The imprints of the rich entwined in sun-drenched sky.

The meadows stretch; my heart throbs with waking tones,
Where orchid blooms and honey-drops collide with earth,
The vibrant blue and green in hues of zephyr mirth,
Reveal the sweet confessions of timeâ€™s resounding moans.

- John Clare
