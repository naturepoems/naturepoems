The autumn leaves falling,
   In a carpet of gold,
They whisper in breezes
   The stories of old.

Nature's phase everlasting,
   Her beauty unfolds,
With the colors of sunset
   In splendor untold.

Let me pause in the stillness,
   With the world at my feet,
For the heart finds its rhythm
   Where the seasons compete.

- James Fenimore Cooper
