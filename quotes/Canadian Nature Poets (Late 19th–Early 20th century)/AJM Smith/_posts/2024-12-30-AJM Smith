Morning Fog

The morning fog hangs low, a wandering soul,
    Cloaking the earth in a silent shroud,
    The world awakens to a gentle roll,
    Each blade of grass, in dew, is endowed.
    Like a painter’s brush, the mist blurs all lines,
    A moment’s grace held in fragile knots,
    The birds’ quick flit in search of their signs,
    As the dawn heralds hope and forgot.

- AJM Smith
