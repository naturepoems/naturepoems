Les Oiseaux

In the morning, birds take flight,  
A symphony amongst the leaves,  
Their songs resound in pure delight,  
In every rustle, nature weaves.  

A chorus bright, of chirps and calls,  
They paint the dawn with joy and cheer.  
As every note in freedom falls,  
The world awakens, pure and clear.

- Anna de Noailles
