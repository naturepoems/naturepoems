The sun rises in golden light,  
Awakening the world from slumber,  
Painting the horizon with hues of fire,  
While the earth sighs in fragrant blooms.

Ode to the land, rich and free,  
Where the plains stretch endlessly wide,  
And the laughter of children blends  
With the songs of birds on high.

- Thomas Mofolo
