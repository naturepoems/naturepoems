Wildflower Meadow

Amidst rolling hills,
Where the wildflowers sprawl,
A tapestry of colors,
Answer nature's call.

With petals like laughter,
And scents that enchant,
In this vibrant embrace,
Life sings a sweet chant.

Oh meadow, dear meadow,
In your beauty so free,
You cradle our spirits,
In wild ecstasy.

- John Thompson
