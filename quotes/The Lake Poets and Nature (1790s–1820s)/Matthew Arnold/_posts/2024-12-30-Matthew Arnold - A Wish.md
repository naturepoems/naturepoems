A Wish

The sorrowful wails of the squall  
Have a great long echoing roar:
But Nature's trembling memory  
Lives alive and is sweet and pure!  

But gentle winds lead man,  
Like clear mountain streams  
Flow through long forests past,  
Till the heart that loses hope so fast!  


- Matthew Arnold
