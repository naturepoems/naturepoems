The Chimney Sweeper
When I was a young boy,
   my father took me to a place.
It was dark and smoldering,
   And my mother's eyes were fire.

My young heart trembled then,
   And I said to the Earth:
These are shadows of my care,
   Shadows of the chains of time.

But there at the river's flow,
   There I threw myself away.
And the glow of the candle light
   A tall house across stood alone.

- William Blake
