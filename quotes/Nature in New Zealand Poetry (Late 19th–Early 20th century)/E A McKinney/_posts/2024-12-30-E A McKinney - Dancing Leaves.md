Dancing Leaves

In the crisp air where autumn prevails,
Leaves dance with a grace that tells ancient tales,
Their colors ablaze, a riot of hue,
Each flutter and twist, a joy to renew.

As they tumble and whirl, caught in delight,
They sing of a season, whisper of night,
The trees, they stand bare, yet bold in their stance,
Holding their memories, letting leaves dance.

So come take a moment, be lost in their spin,
For in every spiral, there’s freedom within,
Nature’s grand fabric woven with care,
In the dance of the leaves, you’ll find beauty rare.
