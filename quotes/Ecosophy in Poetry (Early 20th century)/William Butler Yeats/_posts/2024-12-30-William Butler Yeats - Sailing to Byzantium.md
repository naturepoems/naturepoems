Sailing to Byzantium
That is no country for old men. The young
In one another’s arms, birds in the trees
—Those dying generations—at their song,
The salmon-falls, the bumble-bees,
The mackerel-crowded seas,
Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long.

Whatever is begotten, born, and dies
Caught in that sensual music all neglect
Monuments of unageing intellect.

An aged man is but a paltry thing,
A tattered coat upon a stick, unless
Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing
For every tatter in its mortal dress,
Nor is there singing school but studying
Monuments of its own magnificence;

And therefore I have sailed the seas and come
To the holy city of Byzantium.
O sages standing in god’s holy fire
As in the gold mosaic of a wall,
Come from the holy fire, burn in there,
And be the singing masters of my soul.

Consume my heart away; sick with desire
And fastened to a dying animal
It knows not what it is; and gathers me
Into the artifice of eternity.

Just such a thing as I have known of old
For the first time and ever of all
That I have spoken and of all
Which is of the watching eyes that never fail.

And at midnight the great mind awakes,
And the city of gold beholds the delicate walls,
Be etched by the absorbed tortoise shell
Life glittering like stars and silver wings,
As all the perennial cities bow.

The eyes of the priests and the voices of the tongues
Whose breaches are closed to those whom we must greet;  
All the birds I only know but not forget,
As the woven words weave over and over.

What shall I leave for the young,
For those who roll on earth where grape-vines play,
Where hearts beat back and forth like wings;
These, how can they speak, other than with joy?
For the young and the old are both the same.
They give and gather in the same place, with old history charged in them to the stories.

While time goes on repeating the worn tale,
They tumble with surprise, as they are swept away
As I go on early to the holy places,
With delicate cities, old and full of dreams.

And we both, the young and the old men,
Between rivers and the sleeping fields, we leave this path,
Wandering on the ruffled trees of wreckage,  
Where time comes back but never fails to leave.

- William Butler Yeats
