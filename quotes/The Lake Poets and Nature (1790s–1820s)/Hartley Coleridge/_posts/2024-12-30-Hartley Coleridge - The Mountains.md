The Mountains

Majestic peaks that touch the sky,  
In solitude, they stand up high;  
With snow-capped heads that shine in grace,  
They guard the earth, a sacred place.

In quiet stillness, hear their song,  
A hymn of ages, deep and strong;  
The winds shall weave their tales below,  
While valleys sing, as rivers flow.

- Hartley Coleridge
