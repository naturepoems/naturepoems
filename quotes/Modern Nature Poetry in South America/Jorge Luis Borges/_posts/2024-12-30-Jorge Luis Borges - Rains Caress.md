Rain’s Caress

The rain falls softly,
Each drop a tender kiss
On the thirsty earth,
Awakening life from slumber.

Laughter fills the air,
In the rhythm of the storm,
As plants drink deep
From the clouds’ generous gifts.

Here lies renewal,
Scripted in water’s embrace,
The world refreshed,
A canvas washed anew.


- Jorge Luis Borges
