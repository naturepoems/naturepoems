The brook flows down from the mountain,
  To the river it does run;
The winds do whisper in the heather,
  The grass is glistening with the sun.

Through the woods the shadows play,
  In the vale the flowers bloom;
The beauty of the earth is ever
  Making our hearts resume.

In yon golden skies above
  The lark flits high in mirth;
So too we wander, hand in hand,
  Through the wonder of the earth.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
