The Mongoose

Within their ancient walls new life
Of the unseeing twinkling crests,
So each hair extends yet lingers only
On the side where existence strains vast states.

Rumor settles softly; a cover beneath
Where every sound quiets the breath.
Over rocks she darts and turns to seat
Life like seeds across fertile strands.

Listen to the soul's garden*
That speaks glibly in the native tongue  
Of an unknown dusk; a second flash—
And echoes of sunlight when darkness sends.


- Marianne Moore
