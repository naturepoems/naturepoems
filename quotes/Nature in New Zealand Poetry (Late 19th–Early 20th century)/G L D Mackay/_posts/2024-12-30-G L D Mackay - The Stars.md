The Stars

Upon the sapphire sea, they gleam so bright,  
The stars of the heavens are our guiding light;  
While the silver moon spins tales ineffable and grand,  
Of dreams to stir within this enchanted land.

O bright celestial giants — you hold the night,  
Drawing starlit dreams to escape our sight;  
In the quiet hours, your presence shall stay,  
Like a soft murmuring whisper through the night and the day.


- G L D Mackay
