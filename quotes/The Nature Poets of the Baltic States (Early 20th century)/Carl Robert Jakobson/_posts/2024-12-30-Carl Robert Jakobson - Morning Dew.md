Morning Dew  
Awakening light  
on petals of blooms,  
a whispering breeze  
through the forest looms.  
Each blade of green grass  
fringed with diamonds anew,  
a canvas of wonder  
in the morning dew.  
Listen, oh listener,  
nature unfolds,  
secrets of beauty  
this new day beholds.

- Carl Robert Jakobson
