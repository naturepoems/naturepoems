The Dance of the Leaves  
A rustle, a flutter,  
it's autumn's ballet,  
leaves twirl and sway  
while the wind leads the way.  
A stage made of branches,  
pine needles and bark,  
a seasonal spectacle  
in nature's own park.  
Each leaf is a dancer,  
a moment to cherish,  
in the waltz of the forest,  
a beauty to relish.

- Carl Robert Jakobson
