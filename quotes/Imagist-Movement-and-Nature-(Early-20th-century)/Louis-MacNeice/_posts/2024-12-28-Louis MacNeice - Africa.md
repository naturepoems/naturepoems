Africa
   by Louis MacNeice

And yet, under the lone grass  
The ground covers a world completely,  
In the warmth of sun and ragged rockâ€”  
A beauty full of mystery,  
Life squanders and promises to return,  
For every creature feels the pulse of earth,  
Unfurling in a flash of heat.

- Louis MacNeice
