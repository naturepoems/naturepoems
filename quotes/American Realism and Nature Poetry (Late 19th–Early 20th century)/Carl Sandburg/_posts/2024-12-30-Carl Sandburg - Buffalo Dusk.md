Buffalo Dusk

The last lush across the corn
And green is like blue,
Like the dark shift of a shadow,
Under the great old sun
With a charcoal haziness
Of clouds in gloom;
Cracks of dusk upon the rocks
Where the deep water flows, beneath the hills.
The wind has come,
The summer is still, the water
Resonates with grief when the sun slow
Leads its vast families back into the dark.

- Carl Sandburg
