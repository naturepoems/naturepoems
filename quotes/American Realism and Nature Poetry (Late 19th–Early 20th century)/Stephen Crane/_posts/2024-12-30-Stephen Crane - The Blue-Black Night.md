The Blue-Black Night

The blue-black night
Is like a perfumed countenance
Of a wild flower.
Everything is lost.
The stars are a sad parody.
The moon is a wide shade,
And yet, still I watch—
I wait under the shadowed leaves—
But I cannot rest.  
Only my heart beats
In the blood-red foliage.

- Stephen Crane
