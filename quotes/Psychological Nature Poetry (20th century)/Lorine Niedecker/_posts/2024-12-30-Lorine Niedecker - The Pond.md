What rough-handled beak,
   and silver flies.
The insect noise cuts
   to another realm;
Morning creeps with dew,
   yet day rises according
to the fish's call.
Each pond has its heart,
   wind releases grains,
A sudden twist in canopy
Catches—all the others,
Light sways beneath the sky’s weight.
And quiet retreat is beautiful too.
We whisper in every scene, where
Colors clash and join.
And come springs, we meet.

- Lorine Niedecker
