River's gentle flow, in your cradle I stand,  
your waters like laughter, caressing the land.  
You carve through the valleys, a passage so wise,  
reflecting the heavens in your glimmering guise.

With each twist and turn, you revel and play,  
yet carry the stories that never decay.  
In your depths lies the pulse of the world as it spins,  
and the grace of your journey, where all life begins.

- Émile Zola
