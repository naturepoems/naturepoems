After great pain, a formal feeling comes –  
The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs –  
The stiff Heart questions was it He, that bore,  
And Yesterday, or Centuries before?  

The Feet, mechanical, go round –  
Of Ground, or Air – or O, like a bird –  
Above the Soldiers in their Gates –  
Hands joined behind their back –  
How softly, heads recline,  
Or feels a Pain, or frowns, or this shrug instead  
Of motion's weight –  

But by and by – a thinner pale –  
Shall raise the weary Brow and gleam;  
The gentle gatherings – a few bright care  
And languidity, a bosom care –  
For ever knew rather, Pain, than yield,  
Or sorrow to it all –  


- Emily Dickinson
