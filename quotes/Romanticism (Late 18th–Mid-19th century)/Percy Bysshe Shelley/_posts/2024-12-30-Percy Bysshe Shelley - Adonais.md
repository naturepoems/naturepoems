Adonais

I

Our friend has gone, lost in dark eternal gloom,
Our friend that dared before the end did cast—
But ere he fell asleep, a warmth of light ran,
Bringing brightness across and passions cast.

Those days depart! O the air of thyme to them!
Passing through tended lands to behold Spring!
O Briton owl that every treason known has marked;
Will thou search across the wings of darkened arch!

Way about the earth, the air flows in with mellowed sound,
And fills it with life, that day to night does affect!

- Percy Bysshe Shelley
