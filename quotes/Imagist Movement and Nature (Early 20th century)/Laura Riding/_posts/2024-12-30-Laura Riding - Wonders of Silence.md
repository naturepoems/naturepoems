Here where silence reigns divine, 
Bars every stone to dust yet paneled,
With two sycamores side by side;  
Murmuring their secrets against me, as
Life studying in the cracks smooth across
Pathways threaded softly in their mists,
The sun pours through pale fingers, 
Holding hot against night bare
And quiet the pools of our shadows, 
They sway in concert under such agility; 
This presence unified by height,  
With memory cast against the walls, 
Whisper warmth against broken tiles; 
Nature yawning so beautifully, 
In breath as the eye moves forward.
