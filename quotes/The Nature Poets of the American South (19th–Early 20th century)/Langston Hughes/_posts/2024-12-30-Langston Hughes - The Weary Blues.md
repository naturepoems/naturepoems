The Weary Blues
Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
I heard a Negro play.

Ain't got nobody in all this world,
Ain't got nobody but ma self.
I'se gwine to quit ma frownin'  
And put ma troubles on the shelf.

Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.
He played a few chords, then he sang some more—
I heard the Negro sing.

With his ebony hands on each ivory key
He made that piano moan with melody.

O Blues!

Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool,
He played that sad song like a musical fool.

Sweet Blues!

Coming from a black man's soul,
O Blues, you sing more than I can say!



- Langston Hughes
