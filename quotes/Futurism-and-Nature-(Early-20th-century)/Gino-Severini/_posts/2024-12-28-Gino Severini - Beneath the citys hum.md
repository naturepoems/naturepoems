Beneath the city’s hum, 
a heartbeat echoes, 
a pulse of green amid the gray— 
a struggle, a dance, 
a symphony of resilience.

Blooms erupt from cracks, 
artisans of survival, 
a testament to the wild, 
the untamed heart of nature— 
a defiance to be free.

Together—sun, soil, sky, 
a triumvirate thriving, 
a reminder, amidst turmoil, 
that beauty fights to exist.

- Gino Severini
