The First Spring

When the first warm breath of spring reaches,
Gentle touch on winter’s pale visage,
Life bursts open in jubilant sweeps of color,
And the soft rain nourishes the earth’s bed.

You see the blooms unfurl like young dreams,
Waking tenderly beneath the sun’s light,
Whispers flutter on the edge of petals,
And trees sway to the rhythm of return.

Nature sighs, laughing its joy profound,
Time feels closer, breathing as one,
And in this shift, all hearts are stirred,
Reborn in the promise of life’s embrace.
