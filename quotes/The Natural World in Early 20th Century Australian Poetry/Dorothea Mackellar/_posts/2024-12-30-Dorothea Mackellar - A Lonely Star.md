A Lonely Star
In the vastness of either side,
Twinkling bright is the lonely star,
Sitting in silence, content to guide  
With no burdens of sorrow to mar.

Though the winds may blow fierce and free,
And storms may rage and clash with sound,
In my heart you will always be  
A flicker of calm where peace is found.

- Dorothea Mackellar
