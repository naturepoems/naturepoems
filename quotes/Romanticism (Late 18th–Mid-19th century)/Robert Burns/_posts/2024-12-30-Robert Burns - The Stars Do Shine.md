The stars do shine, the moon does glow,
And thousands mellow beams
Of winter light on hills below,
Set dancing in my dreams.

Oh, come allure my wandering thoughts,
Through every glen and vale;
A symphony of all I sought,
In nature’s sweet prevail.

So let’s put on our journey’s crown,
And greet the dawn with cheer;
For life is but a soft renown,
When loved ones gather here.

- Robert Burns
