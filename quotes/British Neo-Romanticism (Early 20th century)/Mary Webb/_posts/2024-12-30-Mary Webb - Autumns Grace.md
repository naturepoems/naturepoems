Autumn’s Grace

In autumn’s breath, the earth does sigh,
As leaves of gold fall one by one,
The trees, stripped bare under a cobalt sky,
Their story told as day is done.

With brambles ripe and air so sweet,
The harvest yields its fragrant feast,
And as the sun tumbles, a soft retreat,
Life's gentle cycle finds its least.

In every whisper, every song,
The pulse of nature hums with ease,
In autumn’s grace, where souls belong,
The fading light, a soft reprise.


- Mary Webb
