After the Thunder
After the thunder,
a silence holds the earth,
awash with green,
dew puddles rise to greet the sun;
prairies roll softly,
a touch beneath the shroud of mist
a world reborn.

Birds flit above, smiling
as a child lifts its head,
ears the whispers,
the voices of the trees,
come follow,
the stream calls out,
painting all the edges bright!
