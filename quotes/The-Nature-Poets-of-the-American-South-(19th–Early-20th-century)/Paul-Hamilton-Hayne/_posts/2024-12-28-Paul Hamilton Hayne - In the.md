In the Mountains

O lovely mist that in the morning crowns
The verdant hills with silken bands of gold!
Soft as the folds of a fair queen's gown,
Or the dying blush of roses, sweet, untold
In their perfume, dost thou not bless the day
That wakes with thy baptism of soft rain?
Ah! how much beauty lies between the gray
Fingers of the swirling clouds, that richly stain
From dusk to dawn, the lip of whispered hills.
Heaven’s dew doth sparkle round in joyous dance
And swells the pulse of life, through all the rills,
That rush to greet the sea’s eternal trance.
