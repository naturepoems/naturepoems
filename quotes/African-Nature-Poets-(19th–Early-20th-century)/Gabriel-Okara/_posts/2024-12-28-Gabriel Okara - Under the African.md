Under the African Sky
Beneath this vast, sprawling sky,
Where the sun kisses every flower shy,
And the mountains hold ancient lore,
I find my heart’s wish at nature’s door.

The plains stretch wide, rich and warm,
Each creature stirs, and weaves a charm,
In the rustling grass, a life awaits,
Under the African sun, the soul celebrates.

- Gabriel Okara
