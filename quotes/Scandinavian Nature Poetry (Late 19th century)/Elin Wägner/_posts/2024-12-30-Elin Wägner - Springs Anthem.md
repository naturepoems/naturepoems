Upon the hill, the wild winds sing,
Each note a tale of nature’s spring.
The blossoms burst in colors rare,
A joyful burst that fills the air.

The bees, they dance from bloom to bloom,
Their buzzing hymn banishes gloom;
In every petal, life abounds,
In vibrant hues, the heart resounds.

- Elin Wägner
