A Coney Island of the Mind
...the sea is for the sea
and I am for the sea
and as long as the sea
is for the sea
there will be lovers there
in love with the ocean...

I can see now
the beauty of the sea
and the beauty of the mind
whirling together
never forgetting each other
in this mental ocean...


- Lawrence Ferlinghetti
