Of Mere Being
The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands in the pulse of the moment —
A parting that lies like the motion of clouds 
Upon a darkened night.

The palm conceptual, the essence of noise.
Riding the enigmas — pure and unvisited,
Moving toward luminosity — alone.
In this serenity include the nature
Of hiding and revealing and recasting.

- Wallace Stevens
