Winter's chill drapes the world in white,  
Silent footfalls in the soft twilight.  
Snowflakes whisper on the frozen stream,  
The air is crisp, and I softly dream.

Underneath the blanket, the earth holds tight,  
Life is waiting; itâ€™s a still delight.  
Frost-kissed branches, in repose,  
Nature's secret in quiet grows.

- Sigrid Undset
