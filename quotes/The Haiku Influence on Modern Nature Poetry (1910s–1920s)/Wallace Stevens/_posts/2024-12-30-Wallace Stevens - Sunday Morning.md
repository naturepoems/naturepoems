The poem of the mind in the act of finding
What will suffice. It has not always had
To find: the scene was set; it was the first
Delight of the eyes to see the green ground.

The trees, the shadows, the light, the old
House, vacant, by the road. The clouds wore down
Like a veil, and the air was still, as if
The fields had not been plowed.

- Wallace Stevens
