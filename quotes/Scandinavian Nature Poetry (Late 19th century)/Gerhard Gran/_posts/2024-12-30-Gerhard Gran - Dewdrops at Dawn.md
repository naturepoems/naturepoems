The morning dew on blades of grass,
A glittering world, serene and pure,
With every moment, time may pass,
Yet nature's calm will long endure.

Each droplet holds a piece of light,
A promise kept, a guide through day,
In simple joys, my heart ignites,
As I entwine with nature's sway.

- Gerhard Gran
