The ocean sings gently, a lullaby sweet,
As waves kiss the shore in a rhythmic beat.
Seagulls cry out over the expanse so grand,
In the embrace of the sea, I find my own land.

Each grain of sand tells a tale of the tide,
Of journeys and wanderers, of secrets that hide.
In this vastness of blue, my heart learns to roam,
In the depths of nature, I finally feel home.
