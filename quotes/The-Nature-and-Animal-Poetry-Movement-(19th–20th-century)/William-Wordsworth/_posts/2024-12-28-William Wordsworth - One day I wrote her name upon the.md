One day I wrote her name upon the strand,
But came the waves and washed it away:
Again I wrote it with a second hand,
But came the tide, and made my pains his prey.
"Vain man," said she, "that dost in vain assay,
A mortal thing so to immortalize,"  
But I, unfit, can never cease to play  
With things eternal, though they be my sighs.

- William Wordsworth
