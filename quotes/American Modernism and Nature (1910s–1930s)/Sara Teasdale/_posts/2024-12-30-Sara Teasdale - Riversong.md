A river glides through the land,
murmuring secrets in undertones,
a delicate play of light and shadow,
where dreams flow amongst the currents.

The banks cradle life in whispers,
of rustling reeds and dragonflies,
a canvas painted by the seasons,
where harmony thrives beneath the surface.

Find me here, where the water flows,
where time slips softly between fingers—
a timeless beauty in its transit,
imprinted in the sighs of the wind.

- Sara Teasdale
