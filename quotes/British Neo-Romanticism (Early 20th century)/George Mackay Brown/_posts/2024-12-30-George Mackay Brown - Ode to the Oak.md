Ode to the Oak

O mighty oak, you sage of ages,
Your arms outstretched to greet the winds,
The whispers of the past in your bark,
Every knot and twist a tale to tell,
Of summers in abandon and winters' patience.

Under your shade, fair wildflowers bloom,
The laughter of children dances in the light,
As the echoes of their joy fade,
You remain, steadfast and proud,
A witness to the march of time.


- George Mackay Brown
