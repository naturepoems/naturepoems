In the Meadow

In the quiet meadow lying  
Where the daisies bloom and sway,  
I can hear the soft winds sighing  
Telling me the tales of day.  
Oh, the glory of creation  
Cradled here in gentle grace,  
Whispers of the world around me  
Adorning this cherished place.

- A E George William Russell
