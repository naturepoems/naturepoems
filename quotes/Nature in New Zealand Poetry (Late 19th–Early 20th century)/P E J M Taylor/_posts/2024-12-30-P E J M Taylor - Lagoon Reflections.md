Lagoon Reflections

Beneath the stillness of the morning light,  
A lagoon shimmers, a canvas so bright,  
With lilies floating on a sapphire pool,  
Where nature's art speaks, serene and cool.

In the velvet embrace of the dawn's first hue,  
The world awakens, vibrant and new,  
Reflections of mountains and skies collide,  
In this tranquil haven, where dreams reside.

Let us wander by waters, hand in hand,  
In the gentle caress of our magic land,  
For in each moment by the lagoon’s flow,  
We are reminded of the beauty we know.

- P E J M Taylor
