Endymion
A thing of beauty is a joy forever:
Its loveliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.

Therefore, on every morn, are we wreathing
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
So long as we are human, and have birth.

And we are born into a world of woe,
And we are born to see, and suffer so;
Yet every time we hear the throstle's song,
Or see the sunlight through the trees, we know
These things are real; our dreams are not entirely wrong.

By the beauty and the love that nature gives,
We learn to live, and know that beauty lives.

- John Keats
