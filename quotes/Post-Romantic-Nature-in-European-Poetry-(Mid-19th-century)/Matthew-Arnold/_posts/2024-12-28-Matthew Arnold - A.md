A Wish

O, to be with thee, I wish,  
As the longing night may stay!  
The breezes fold like petals hips  
Where the ocean tides repose at play.  
And in the silence of the sail  
The pull of the stars might sing,  
As the willows brush the boughs array  
Where dew-drops fall as evening clings.  

Let us drift through the fair designs  
And along the meridian shore,  
Where the swaying pulse divine  
Kisses the sails, to hope is more.  
And come as fresh as springtime’s breath  
Where no knowing can let slip our dreams;  
As joy breaks forth in scented depth,  
And through love’s final harmony gleams.


- Matthew Arnold
