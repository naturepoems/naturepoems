In the petals of the wildflower,
I see the laughter of the sun,
As it spills gentleness over leaves,
Awakening spirit and life, a soft hymn
Composed by roots plunged beneath;
And as dusk arrives to cradle the day,
The earth exhales, an immense sigh,
Letting all its beauty stay,
Whispering secrets of time to timelessness,
And in the twilight, I wish to linger,
A prayer wrapped in the warmth of spring,
To witness the wonder of each evening—
The way we are shaped by what we touch,
In the embrace of nature’s arms.

— "Wildflower Prayer"
