The Waterfall

I hear the rush and roar  
  Of the waterfall,  
The thunder of its heart  
  That answers to my call.  
It leaps from rock to rock,  
  And dances in the sun,  
A silvery thread of life,  
  'Til the day is done.

Its voice is like a spirit's song  
  That lures me from afar;  
A beacon where no shadows cling,  
  A glittering guiding star.  
I long to plunge within its arms,  
  To feel its cool embrace,  
To toast my soul with its wild joy,  
  In the hallowed, misty space.

O dim and wondrous creature,  
  Of mountain, rock, and stone,  
You cleanse my weary, worried heart  
  While I wandering roam.  
In your frothy kiss of crystal clear,  
  I bathe my deepest care,  
And as the twilight gathers round,  
  I give my soul to air.

- Charles GD Roberts
