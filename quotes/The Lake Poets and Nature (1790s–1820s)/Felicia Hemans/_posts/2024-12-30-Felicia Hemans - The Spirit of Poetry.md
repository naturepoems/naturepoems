The Spirit of Poetry
We breathe the air of Poets' land,
Where plenty overflows—from seas,
And smiles in every verdant strand,
And shines in every night-breeze.

A place—the soil is rich and free,
Where waters dance in every glade,
And flowers grow in majesty,
And trees throw shadows by their shade.

- Felicia Hemans
