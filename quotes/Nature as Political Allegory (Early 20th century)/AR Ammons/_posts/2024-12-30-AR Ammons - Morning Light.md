Morning breaks with quiet humility,
apples and figs ripening in rich earth,
a spin of gold threaded through branches
where the secret of living unfolds,
starlight captured in the sap
of the cosmos.

The breeze whispers gentle reassurance,
and I am here, anchored in soil,
each petal a witness to timeâ€™s embrace,
a blushing interlude of being, of breath.
