Chatter, chatter, about the night,
   This hollow, moaning—is it true?
She's been lurking well from sight,
   In the delicate evening hue.

The flowers bloom, occasionally clear:
   I can’t help imagining her.
If I am to gain anything here,
   I must start at quiet, residing.

— *To Penelope*

- John Keats
