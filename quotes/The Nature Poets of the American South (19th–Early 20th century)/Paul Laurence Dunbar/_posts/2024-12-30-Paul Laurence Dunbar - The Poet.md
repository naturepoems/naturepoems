The Poet

The poet is a dreamer, he may be a clown,
With flutter of light wings, and steps of the brown,
With visions and hopes in a whispering sound.

He chants to the stars, and to bubbling brooks,
Of great vales of laughter, of golden books;
And soft, airy musings, as minutes come round.

Yet he, too, laughs, and smiles, by night and by day;
And though shadows may darken his heart on the way,
He croons his best melodies and flows.

No quilt of dreams can cover him whole;
But the deepest of springs does dance in his soul;
And he calls to the heavens with pure, noble hope.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
