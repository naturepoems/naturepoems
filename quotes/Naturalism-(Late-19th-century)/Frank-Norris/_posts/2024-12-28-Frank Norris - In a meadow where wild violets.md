In a meadow where wild violets bloom,
And the sweet wind carries the scent like perfume,
There lies an expanse, both tender and vast,
Where larks’ songs uplift, and shadows are cast.

The sun spills its treasure, a golden embrace,
Upon flowers that nod in a lively grace.
Every moment encased in nature’s own plan,
As the tide of existence flows deeper than man.

For the earth holds her secrets, chiseled in stone,
In the heart of the wild, we’re never alone.
Every leaf, every gust, whispers soft as the dawn,
A testament written in beauty and song.

- Frank Norris
