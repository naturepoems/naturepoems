The mountains stand, proud and tall,  
Guardians of the land, watching all,  
With valleys rich and rivers wide,  
In nature's embrace, where my heart resides.

Every rock and stone, a tale to tell,  
Of time and change, of rise and fell,  
Nature weaves its intricate threads,  
In the quiet moments, where all life treads.

- Thomas Mofolo
