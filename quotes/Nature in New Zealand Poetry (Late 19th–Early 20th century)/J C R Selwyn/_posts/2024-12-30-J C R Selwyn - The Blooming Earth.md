The Blooming Earth
The blooming earth, awash with light,
In colors bright, a wondrous sight,
Emerging from the winter’s chill,
Awakening the good earth’s will.

Here violets sigh, and daisies cheer,
With fragrant breaths, they draw us near,
Each petal whispers love untold,
As spring unfolds her arms of gold.

O Nature, artist bold and free,
With every stroke, you speak to me,
Your canvas stretches, wide and vast,
A testament to ages past.

So let me wander through your grace,
And find my true, beloved place,
Among the blooms, I wish to roam,
For in your heart, I’ll find my home.

- J C R Selwyn
