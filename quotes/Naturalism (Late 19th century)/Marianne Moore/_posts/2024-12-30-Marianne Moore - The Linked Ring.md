The Linked Ring
A marble-milled dusk,  
A projection of the unblinking sky,  
Silvery dune-gleamed leaves—  
And the linked loam begins living,  
A marking of their shadowed time.

The world cools, holding vibrance  
Of intimacy  
While disguising tomorrow  
In the forest’s lush crown,  
Tender with the seams of night.


- Marianne Moore
