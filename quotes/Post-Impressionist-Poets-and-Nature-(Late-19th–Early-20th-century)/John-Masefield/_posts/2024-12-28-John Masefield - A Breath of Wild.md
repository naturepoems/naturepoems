A Breath of Wild Air

It is a good thing to be cold,
To lie at peace beneath the stars;
To feel the mighty silence roll
Around the hills, and over the cars.
It is a good thing to stand alone,
To walk the clean and wind-wrought slopes,
And see the fading green of stone
Against the serried sea thoughts of hopes.

- John Masefield
