Sparkling night, your treasures beckon,
In the black velvet of the cosmos,
Where every star pulsates with dreams,
And the moon carries whispered secrets.

Oh, sweet dusks and tranquil dawns,
You cradle my worries in your arms,
I wander under your embrace,
Finding peace in your boundless grace.

In the silence of the universe,
I hear the heartbeat of all that is,
Reminding me that I, too, belong,
To this limitless adventure called life.

- Gabriela Mistral
