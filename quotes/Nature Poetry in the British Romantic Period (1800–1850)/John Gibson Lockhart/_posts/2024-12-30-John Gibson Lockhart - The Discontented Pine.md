THE DISCONTENTED PINE

I.
In the shadiest nook of the forest,
Where the sunbeams sifted dim,
I found a tall pine
From whence I had heard a plaintive hymn;
A spirit of sorrow was there,
A sigh on the evening air.

II.
“O show me the land of the free,”
The tall pine sighed in vain;
“Where the sun shines bright,
And the waters flow,
But I am chained by fate’s decree,
To stand in this spot alone!”

III.
The wind it whispers pain, no jest,
To the heart of the lovelorn tree;
Another loves far away,
In the thicket, in bloom,
But why must I mourn,
Before my time comes to die?”

IV.
So says the tall pine,
With needles so keen,
A fresh autumn night passes by,
Yet sleep in silence shall cease,
One day I’ll wander far,
To the land of the free,”

V.
But the night grows cold,
As I wish for the cessation,
To the core of the wood; 
Forever I’d stand, but bitter my tears,
In a place where I feel so lost —
In pain of this discord.

VI.
So whispered the trees,
Yet still stands the pine;
For all of the want,
I’ve no lover here, 
No hope shall abide,”
With a sigh on the land.

VII.
Alas! That I pine! 
When the evenings cool and dim.
No place to roam or seek,
But bide within walls of green,
Yet longing and longing,
To make my escape someday all the same.
