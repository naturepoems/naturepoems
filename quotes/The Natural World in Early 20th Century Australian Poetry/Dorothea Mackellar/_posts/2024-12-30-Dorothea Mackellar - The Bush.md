The Bush
O, the scene of gold and green,
At the heart of a crystal dream  
Stands the beauty of the bush,
In the sunlight glimmering a gleam.

With the treasures my heart can view,
In the heart of the land I roam  
As I whisper to the wattle,
Where a sense of peace finds home.

- Dorothea Mackellar
