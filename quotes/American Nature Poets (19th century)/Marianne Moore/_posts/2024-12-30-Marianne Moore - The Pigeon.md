The Pigeon

The pigeon builds her nest, softly,
Among the leaves, rounded, plump,
Rocking, between branches and twilight,
Where shadows mingle furtively,
David and Goliath play a charm there,
Their feathers glint with borrowed light,
In one easy attitude, a gentle heart embraces,
Among the dappled shadows all around.

- Marianne Moore
