As autumn breathes its golden wisdom,
  The leaves, like stories, tumbling down,
  The world adorned in warm traditions,
  In every hue, a fleeting crown.
  
  The crisp air carries echoes of laughter,
  A harvest moon begins to rise,
  And in the twilight, tales of nature,
  Whisper secrets, soft and wise.

- Konstantin Balmont
