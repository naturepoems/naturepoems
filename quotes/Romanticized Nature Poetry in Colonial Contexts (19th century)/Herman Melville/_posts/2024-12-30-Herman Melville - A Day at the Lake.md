A Day at the Lake
With shimmering reflections bright,
Where the water meets the trees,
I pace along the sandy sight,
In quiet woods, in cooling breeze.

And every ripple sings a tune,
Of laughter woven in the mist,
Of golden rays that chase the moon,
And nature’s kiss, a tranquil tryst.

The emerald reeds sway to and fro,
Like children dancing in the light,
As here, beside the lake, I know,
The joy of day, the peace of night.

In solitude, my heart shall dwell,
Embracing life in every form,
For here, the stories linger well,
As nature weaves her vibrant charm.

— Excerpt from "A Day at the Lake" (not an actual poem of Melville)

- Herman Melville
