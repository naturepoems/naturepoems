The Skeleton in Armor
By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

In the long burial of generations, 
A skeleton remains in armor,
Locked deep in glacial permanence.
So loyal is this shielded soul; 
It thrived through winter’s discontent  
Yet remembers the dance of vibrant flowers,
The bliss of pacing woodland favorites.
