The rivers’ paths are winding, yet they know  
The course of life that carries them along;  
With every bend, they gather strength to flow,  
In valleys rich with tales, both weak and strong.  
Let us like rivers carve our way with grace,  
And find our journey in this sacred space.

- John Steinbeck
