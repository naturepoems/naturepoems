The Beauty of Nature

To the dew-besprinkled grass I kneel 
With the vast and gentle onsets near,
To drink deep where Nature's breath meets zeal,
A silence sings my spirit clear.

Her hills rise warm with dignity,
As shadows dance in the light's broad sun,
And I clasp the beauty of this harmony,
A blend of souls, two Earth made one.
â€”Sidney Lanier
