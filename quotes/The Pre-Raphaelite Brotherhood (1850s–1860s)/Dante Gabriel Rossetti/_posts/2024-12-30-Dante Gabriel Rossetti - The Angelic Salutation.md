The Angelic Salutation

The Angelic Salutation;
  which is what men repeat
  with their breaths in sepulchres,
  shrinking down from heaven; but not mere hearts on beat.

They murmur prayers, in theory, we flee,
  vibrating with snows in the hymns,
  and put ourselves back to our moonlit eyes
  falling softly at watch among thought's whim.

They do see, as with perpetual prismed shades,
  unto green laced leaves almost terrestrial faire,
  and will fall to paradiso, whence starlit wakes;
  If they were to awake, we would abide in innocence and air.
  If they could brush, or pluck each purity un shown,
  but time will take it, whence these things are grown,
  as the likeness of a child is a wee sight struck grey,
  which leaves nothing bright where our dreams may play.
  Thus paradise that will be well might sway by silence.


- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
