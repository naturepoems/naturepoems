Hummingbird

In the cool dawn of morning,
As the sun blushes the horizon,
The hummingbird flits,
A delicate creature of light,
With wings like whispers,
Fluttering like soft melodies
Against the canvas of air.

It sips at the nectar
Of the blooming flower,
Calling out the sweetness of life,
A fleeting moment captured,
In the delicate architecture of nature,
Where each beat of its wings
Echoes the pulse of creation,
And I long to capture, to hold dear,
This moment of perfection, this intimacy.

- D H Lawrence
