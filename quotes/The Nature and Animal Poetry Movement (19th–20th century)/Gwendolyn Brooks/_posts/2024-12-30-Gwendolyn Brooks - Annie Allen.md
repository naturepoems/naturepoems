Annie Allen

Annie Allen, crowned in her youth
By the finest man-made crown,
In an untroubled angels’ cell,
And high golden tower.

With a dimming grave,
She whispers softly to the stars,
And savors loss,
Sinks beneath the trees,
Like deep roots that sleep
And dream of something still.


- Gwendolyn Brooks
