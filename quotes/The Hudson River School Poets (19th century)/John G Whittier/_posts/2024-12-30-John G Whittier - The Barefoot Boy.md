The Barefoot Boy

Blessings on thee, little man!
Barefoot boy, with cheeks of tan!
With thy turned-up pantaloons,
And thy merry whistled tunes;
With thy cap of Apple green,—
What, though you are small and mean!

Feckless-hearted, joy-begotten,
'Tis thy heart is like a diamond,—
More than hearts of kings and kings,
Pulling the common wealth of things.

- John G Whittier
