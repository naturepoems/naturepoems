The Garden Fancies
  
  I.  
  
   Take the world’s widee view,  
   Let’s start anew,  
   Where buds awaken,  
   School the earth in greens,  
   Listen to the wind-stream's sounds,  
   Hear the rivers waking leaps,  
   Feel the light that’s breaking through  
  In nature’s rounded blooms.

II.  
  
   Pink is the rose of dawn,  
   White the snow, that’s gone,  
   Where the stars align,  
   In patterns that it designs,  
   Time forgets to fly—  
   Here each bloom shall sigh.

- Robert Browning
