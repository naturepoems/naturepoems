Love is Not All

Love is not all:
It is not pure
That gives the thought a purer cast,
With blurred reflections in the rain,
Yet love unlocks the door.

A thought, so plain,
Unwinding softly under trees,
The hollowed branches where the rain
Will clutched, returns on wings that please.

Love can slip so melancholy,
And cunning as the evening mist;
It would therefore lie beneath a rose,
And the parting stars are kissed.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
