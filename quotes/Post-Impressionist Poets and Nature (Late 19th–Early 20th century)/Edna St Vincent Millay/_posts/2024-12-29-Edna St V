The Song of the Rose

Give me the rose that blooms unto the spring,
The lightness of petals opened, HALO,  
Eagerly weaving sweet delights of song.
For all the dewdrops bless the soft tongue,
I carry your fragrance as a stocking’s thrill,  
And midnight whispers beckoning afar.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
