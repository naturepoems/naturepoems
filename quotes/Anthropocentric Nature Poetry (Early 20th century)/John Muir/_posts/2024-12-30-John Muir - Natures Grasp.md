Nature’s Grasp

In nature’s grasp, my soul takes flight,
With every breeze, so pure and light,
The flowers bloom, and rivers sing,
A symphony that life will bring.

The mountains rise, their glory near,
Each rocky step, a path sincere,
Oh let me tread on sacred ground,
In nature's peace, my truth is found.

For every breath, a gift bestowed,
In every step, the story flowed,
A bond with earth, a dance divine,
In nature’s heart, my heart aligns.

- John Muir
