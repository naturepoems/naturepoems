Hope is the thing with feathers—  
That perches in the soul—  
And sings the tune without the words—  
And never stops at all—  

And sweetest— in the Gale— is heard—  
And sore must be the storm—  
That could abash the little Bird  
That kept so many warm—  

I’ve heard it in the chillest land—  
And on the strangest Sea—  
Yet—never—in Extremity,  
It asked a crumb—of me.

- Emily Dickinson
