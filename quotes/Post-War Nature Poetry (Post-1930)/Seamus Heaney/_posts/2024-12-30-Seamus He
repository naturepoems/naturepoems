The Sunlight on the Fen

He stood—not one beyond straight concerns—
Below a black entrance, above ferns that told
What rain swept down white dew. A ear pressed clouds
And sunk across Lines—lost on perfumed run
Weighted with wet light to one more call.

I saw myself emerging toward lean hushes,
Where gates swung columned low an opening gaze
Of harder edges lost, as countries would tumble
With that pulse beneath, a sun split, a new start swung,
And chants streamed—with earth’s outstretch bobbing gold
On well-grounded silhouettes of their gait—

So round, graceful, so sing song, tinted care’s last!
The paths draped to churn whole with host,
Withwards to dust so smooth as sin; through wind;
Deep covers leaning low calling back first days,
The steadiness drags open hands to die out slow—

A figure in the rear, stilled in limbs of flesh,
Throwing green beneath, long bent shoulders winged,
And that the futures turned bright, sad as angels would soar—
A light hoarse glimmer jolted along massed grooves,
With stems that took breath among last summers stars!

Nothing turned warmth inside, but time spaces made renewed.
Let what is to come—meet, seal grey towels up, in red!
