Sunday Morning

Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her.
This is evening; I look upon the sun
And think how beautiful it is, where the trees
Top the land and the light is a friendly glow.

Her fineness as the tiger is its own
And to touch her is also to touch
What is tender and grown. I look through
Softly shadowed light and see: this is life,

This is growth; the bird song is almost a silence,
And there are shadows in all the spaces; trees,
Fallen leaves, and the faintest echoes just above
The flowers that whisper below.

But are they singing, too, this beauty?
Is there from them the fragrance mixed with
The fading light and the true colors of their time?

And I think how calm it seems, this whole
Vast land and its complexity of air is where
The world is; I taste the air and care for
What it offers in returning this odd embrace,

As the summer sun’s glint is on the water so
I stand contemplative and where thought begins,
In balance’s gentleness, with the sun upon me.



- Wallace Stevens
