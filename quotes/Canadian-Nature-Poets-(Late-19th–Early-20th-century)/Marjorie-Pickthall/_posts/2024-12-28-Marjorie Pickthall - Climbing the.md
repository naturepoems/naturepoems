Climbing the Rocks

I climb where the wild vines are draped,
   Over the cliffs where the memory wanes;
The sea’s soft whisper, the sky’s sweet shapes,
   Call out to me in their silver refrains.

The air is thick with the scent of the pines,
   The sunlight kisses the craggy stones;
I lose my cares in the dance of the vines,
   And find my heart among nature’s tones.

- Marjorie Pickthall
