To Autumn

Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
To bear, and swell, and sate, and then run over
With sweet, sweet wine, and that the little brown
Landed exiled from the original experience, raw
Forever now, under the moon's out of bounds..

           John Keats
