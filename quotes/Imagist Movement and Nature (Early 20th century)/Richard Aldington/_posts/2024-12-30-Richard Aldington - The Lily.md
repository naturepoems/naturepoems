The Lily

This is the lily,
Loosed from her beauty
Of white spire, infinite,
That shivers southwards down
The dry mossy stones
That flaunt in
Her lilied frailty.

She weeps alone:
For the water-foot waits
In her heart of purity.
She cries from her beauty,
Dust, lily,
Full-fingered folds of sun.

Be thou lily-water,
In the root of sleep
Slumbering forth —
It breaks upon the reeds
Backwards against the basking,—
And the golden air
Blows about her —
Of every weight of fragrance,
The deadness of things,
Lies at the base of the lily.

- Richard Aldington
