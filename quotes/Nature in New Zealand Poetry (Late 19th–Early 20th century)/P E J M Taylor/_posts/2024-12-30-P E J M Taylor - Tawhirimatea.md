Tawhirimatea

Ocean's fury and sky's embrace,  
Tawhirimatea, in your grace,  
You stir the clouds, summon the rain,  
In your tempest, we feel the pain.

Your winds howl like a restless beast,  
Yet hush with the quiet of a sacred feast,  
From the depths you rise to cleanse the day,  
Refreshing the earth, come what may.

We honor your power, your song, your might,  
In the dark of the storm and the glow of the light,  
Oh, mighty force of nature's domain,  
Tawhirimatea, you forever reign.

- P E J M Taylor
