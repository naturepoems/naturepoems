Cargoes

Quinquireme of Nineveh from distant Ophir,
Rowing home to haven under the Hill,
Gold and spices in that quay,
And the sails of white on sea of blue.

A weary fisherman under the dusky sky
With a net of silver, the fading sun he sighs,
In the long shadows falling under the sea,
Can dream of golden cargo set to the tide’s lullaby.

- John Masefield
