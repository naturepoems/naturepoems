The Sea
  
O dear vast sea,
With your waves rolling,
Their rhythm a mirror
Of eternity's motion,
Where every crest
Is a whisper of laughter,
Every trough a sigh.

You capture the essence,
Of life in your churn,
And my heart is a small boat,
In your great embrace,
Tossed about yet cradled,
In the wildness of your surface.

Your tide comes, my spirit flows,
Back to join your caress.
Such a peace in the restless dance,
Such a pull, both tender and strong,
Let me drift upon your whispers,
To find solace in the depths.

                         - DH Lawrence
