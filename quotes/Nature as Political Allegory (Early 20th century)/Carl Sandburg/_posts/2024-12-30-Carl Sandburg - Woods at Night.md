The woods are dark,
The trees are tall,
With shadows that whisper
In the damp air.

What is this song,
What is this hum,
That rises over the leaves
And weaves a soft blanket of night?

I would wander still,
In the company of these heights,
And listen to tales, tangled in the roots,
To know the secrets of the forest,
And the breath of the night air.


- Carl Sandburg
