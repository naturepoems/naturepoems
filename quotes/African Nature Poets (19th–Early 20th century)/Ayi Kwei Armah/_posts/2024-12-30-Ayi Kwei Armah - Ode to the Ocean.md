The ocean stretches endlessly, 
    a canvas of azure and white, 
    where waves wave goodbye
    and hello, in a rhythmic dance.  

Shells whisper secrets of the deep, 
    carried by tides, singing of journeys, 
    as the sun dips beneath the horizon, 
    painting the waves in hues of fire.  

Seagulls cry, guardians of the shore, 
    their wings tracing arcs in the sky, 
    while fishermen cast their nets, 
    threading dreams into the vast expanse.
