The Old Prison

On the far side of the dark
River, the old prison waits;
Its stillness holds the scent of rain,
The sorrow of the clouds.

The trees are small, the world is dark,
Yet it leans to the history of soil
And the stone remembers the heartbeats
Of those who came and went like shadows.

But my soul is still here,
Like a vigil by the water, like a dream
In the wilderness,
Holding out for the wildness of the trees
And the leap of the river, unseen.


- Judith Wright
