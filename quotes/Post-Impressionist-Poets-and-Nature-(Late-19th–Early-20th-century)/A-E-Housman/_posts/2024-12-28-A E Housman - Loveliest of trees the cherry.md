Loveliest of trees, the cherry now
Is hung with bloom along the bough,
And stands about the woodland ride,
Waving in the wind's light.

Now, of my threescore years and ten,
Twenty will not come again,
And take from seventy springs a score,
It only leaves me fifty more.

Fifty springs and my?

- A E Housman
