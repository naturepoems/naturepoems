quote: "A lone tree stands against the sky,
Its branches sway, a dance so slow,
Leaves exchanging secrets with the breeze,
Time's passage, in each ebb and flow."

A lone tree stands against the sky,
Its branches sway, a dance so slow,
Leaves exchanging secrets with the breeze,
Time's passage, in each ebb and flow.

- Jacques Réda
