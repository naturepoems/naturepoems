The Lotus

The lotus rises from the murky depths,
An exquisite flower, unfolding,
Emerging from the sludge,
A testament to the beauty
That can surmount despair,
Its petals open wide
To embrace the light.

It dances upon the surface,
Beneath the weight of the world,
Finding its grace in the struggle,
In the quiet murmur of still waters,
And I, too, reach toward the sun,
Seeking solace in the shadows,
In the stillness of being,
Where the heart can bloom like the lotus,
In a life beautifully entwined,
Brimming with possibilities.

- D H Lawrence
