Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird

I
Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.

II
I heard it in the cicadas  
As it sang of the past.
The icicles that seemed to dwell in  
The embrace of the world.

III
I was of three minds,
Like a tree
In which there are three blackbirds.

IV
The blackbird whistled
Its simple song.  
I thought I saw it fly.

V
Its shadow had flown,
Into the woods, it was goneâ€”
But it lingered on, a voice.


- Wallace Stevens
