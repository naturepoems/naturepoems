Autumn Leaves
Fallen leaves in crisp decay,
A tapestry of gold and red;
Each whisper tells of yesterday,
When life was danced, and love was said.

With every gust, a memory flies,
Through empty branches, bare and cold;
Yet in their fall, a promise liesâ€”
The cycle spins, as life unfolds.

- Ilya Ehrenburg
