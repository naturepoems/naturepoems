The mountains echo back our dreams,
A place where spirits soar so high.
With roaring streams and gentle beams,
We breathe the air, and wonder why.

In natureâ€™s court, our hearts are free,
As every sigh finds voice in song.
Together, we shall ever be,
In harmony, where hearts belong.

- Marie de France
