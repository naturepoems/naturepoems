In the Meadow  
In the meadow, where daisies grow,  
And Indian paintbrush peers through green,  
The rivers weave, and breezes flow,  
A canvas rich, a tranquil scene.

Each laughter of the lark above,  
Calls out the joy of brightened days,  
In every hue, a shade of love,  
In every step, my heart conveys.

The gentle sway of grasses fine,  
A dance beneath the bright sky light,  
In nature’s arms, my soul aligns,  
To capture all that feels so right.

So let me linger, let me stay,  
In this meadow, a sacred place,  
With gratitude, I’ll hum and play,  
For life, in nature’s soft embrace.

- Richard Crashaw
