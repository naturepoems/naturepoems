In the depths of the garden, life quietly grows,
In patches of color, where sweetness bestows.
The hum of existence, the flutter of wings,
In such simple moments, true beauty it brings.

With petals in bloom, painting life with their shades,
The scents weave a tapestry that never fades.
From daffodils bright, to the roses that sway,
Each blossom a message, shared softly each day.

So venture with me, through this garden of grace,
Where nature’s pure heartbeat we lovingly trace.
In the whispers of flowers, our souls intertwine,
For in these wild wonders, our hearts brightly shine.

- Virginia Woolf
