The River’s Call
I heard the river calling,
In the shimmering light of dawn,
Its voice a soft entrancing song,
That lingered on and drew me on.

Down it wound through vale and glade,
Whispering secrets to the trees;
Each bend a story gently laid,
Flowing endlessly with ease.

Come bathe your sorrows in my tide,
Let every worry drift away,
In crystal currents, love and pride
Sustaining life, they gently sway.

O river! teach me thine own art,
To glide with grace, yet always flow,
For you have captured my soft heart,
And painted joy where shadows grow.

- J C R Selwyn
