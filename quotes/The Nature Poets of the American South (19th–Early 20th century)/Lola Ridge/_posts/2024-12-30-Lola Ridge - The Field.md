The Field

In the field  
  the dandelions 
  twine their golden heads,  
 
They are bright flames,  
  And burn out their lives.  
  And the soft air slips  
 
Through the perfectly woven  
  sleeves of their petals,  
  to fall down the vale.  
 
But I saw one to bend,  
  and grow up tall,  
  As if it had a heart  
 
That wanted to hold things,  
  Between its stirring hands,  
  The laughter of sunlight  
 
Steamed way up behind the mounds,  
  And tilled yet another bridge,  
But became a light  
 
Where dandelions played.
