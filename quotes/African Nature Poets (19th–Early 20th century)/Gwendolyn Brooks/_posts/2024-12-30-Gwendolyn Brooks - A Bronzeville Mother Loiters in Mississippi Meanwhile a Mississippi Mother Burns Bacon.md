A Bronzeville Mother Loiters in Mississippi. Meanwhile, a Mississippi Mother Burns Bacon.

    They tell me
    I must be frank.
    My son’s name is
    Andrew.
    And he wears the
    silver shoes.

    (When I think of somebody’s son)
    But I am not here to
    say anything of anybody’s
    son.

    My son, Andrew,
    was my toy!
    I gave him the best.
    How could I help? He
    was my son!
    I made the mother’s
    love the only important thing.

    But I must be frank.
    I know,
    this must be history’s question.
    Why did he
    set again my fears?

    Humming under my son’s shadow
    my sole face did not match the
    heritage to which he belonged.

(Because he died with blood on) his
    -bare feet, and because
    in the morning
    the flowers bore
    his scent. And scabbed shoes
    beside me turn burning flames.)

    I must tell you again,
    I must be frank
    (There is no joy)
    in Mississippi.

    My son!
    He was born of me!
    I go,
    I go,
    (through the summer)
    without my burns—you dare not
    take my son, away from my
    own history!

    But there is no more
    to say or do—
    And no one appointed
    my despair

    yet I swear to
    the flame around my son.
    O, beauty of his scent!
    Life belongs to love all day long.
    There is no feeling,
    from the bronze warmth of the
    Little Sons and Mothers of the night!

- Gwendolyn Brooks
