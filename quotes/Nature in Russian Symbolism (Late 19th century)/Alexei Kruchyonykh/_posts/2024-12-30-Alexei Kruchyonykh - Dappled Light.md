Dappled Light
Under the canopy where sunlight falls,
A mosaic of shadows, the soft forest calls.
Leaves flutter gently, a whispering choir,
Nature's own heartbeat, a pulsing desire.

Here in the dappled light, tranquility reigns,
Each moment a treasure that stillness contains.
Lost in this haven, time ceases to flee,
In the arms of the forest, I am truly free.

- Alexei Kruchyonykh
