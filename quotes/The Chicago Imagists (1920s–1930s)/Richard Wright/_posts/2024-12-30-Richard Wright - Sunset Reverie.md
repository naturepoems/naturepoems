The sun dips below the horizon,
A golden farewell to the day,
The sky ignites in hues of fire,
Painting the evening with hope.

I stand lost in wonder,
As shadows stretch and yawn,
The world takes a breath,
Before plunging into night.

Each star emerges slowly,
A tiny spark of magic,
Reminding me of dreams,
That linger in the dark,
Waiting for the call of dawn.

- Richard Wright
