Spring  
O Thou who passest thro’ our vallies in  
Thy Chariot of the Sun!  
Crowned with light, from light descended,  
And back into the golden ground  
  
As by thy magic wand  
The earth hath summer crowned.  
From the vale in the size of night,  
Thou bringest forth good things delight.  
**William Blake**
