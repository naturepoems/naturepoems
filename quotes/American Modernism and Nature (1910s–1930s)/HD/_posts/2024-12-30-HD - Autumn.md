Autumn

   I’ll gather leaves,
   with your secrets steeped,
    for you alone,
   as the fruits slip into the folds
 of your warm hands,
   where time nests itself,
   around the dust;—
   what is more?  
   Your searching eyes, stumble,
   beneath the sun’s breath,
   among the still, flowered willows.
 —H.D.
