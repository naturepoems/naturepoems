The Waves

In silver spray, the ocean greets,
With laughter rolled upon the shore,
Each wave a tale, a heart that beats,
A rhythm flowing, evermore.

The silky tide that ebbs and flows,
In every curl, a story spun,
Of distant lands and hidden woes,
In every crash, a life begun.

The salty taste, the briny breath,
Embrace the wanderer, the bold,
For in this dance, there’s life and death,
The silent secrets of the old.

So stand and watch the waves collide,
Let nature’s pulse entwine your soul;
For in this depth where dreams reside,
The ocean whispers, makes us whole.
