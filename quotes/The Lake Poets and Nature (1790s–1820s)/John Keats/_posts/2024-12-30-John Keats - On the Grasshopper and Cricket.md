On the Grasshopper and Cricket
The poetry of earth is never dead:
When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,
And hiding in the shady leaves, I wish
To hear what grasshoppers sing their fun.

To me it is a sweet, and mellow tune,
That chirrups softly, whispering the night,
As always, they are life’s injunctions too,
And tell of love that scents the air so right.

- John Keats
