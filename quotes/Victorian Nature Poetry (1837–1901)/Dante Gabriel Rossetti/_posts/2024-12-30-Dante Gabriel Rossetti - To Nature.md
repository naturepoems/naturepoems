To Nature
O Lady of my dreams so bright,  
Intent to welcome every sigh;  
I yearn to gaze on morning light  
Through softened dreams where flowers lie.

Of all the whispers in the trees,  
Your laughter echoes in my breath;  
Oh let me run through paths of leaves,  
And find the bloom beyond thy death.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
