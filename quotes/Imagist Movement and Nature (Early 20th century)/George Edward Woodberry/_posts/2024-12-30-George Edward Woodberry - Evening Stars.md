At dusk observed, the stars are meek,
They scatter gems upon the tide,
That whisper gently words we seek,
Like dreams that drift, and never hide.

With evening’s hush, the world turns slow,
And beauty basks in nature’s glow,
As darkness wraps the day’s bright show,
A gentle muse to soothe our woe.

- George Edward Woodberry
