To the Lake

Oh, rolling lake, profound and deep,
    In your depths the sunbeams play;
They dance and laugh, as I stand and weep,
    For you are now the day of the day.
Like a mother you wrap me round
    In your arms of a silken clasp;
Your waves like a mother's breast resound,
    While I falter, like a child's gasp.

You glisten beneath the bright, blue sky,
    And bathe the hills in your light.
And I shall stand, as the sundrops die,
    And slowly gliding in the night.

Oh veil the dreamer with your waves,
    Until my soul takes wings and flies;
As the light too slowly fades and saves,
    And the last, bright after-glow dies.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
