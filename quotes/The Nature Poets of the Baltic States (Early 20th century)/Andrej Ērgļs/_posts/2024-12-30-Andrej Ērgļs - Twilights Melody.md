The twilight comes with gentle steps,  
As crickets tune their evening song,  
The sun bows down with crimson hues,  
And stars prepare to come along.

The night unfolds a velvet cloak,  
Swathing the earth in deep embrace,  
While owls take flight on silent wings,  
Guardians of the moonlit space.

In the depths of night, the world transforms,  
Underneath the shimmer and glimmer,  
Nature rests her weary head,  
In dreams where shadows softly shimmer.

- Andrej Ērgļs
