A Season in Hell

O the beautiful hands, the beautiful mouths,
And the beautiful eyes I see in this room!
There are hands to caress the secrets hidden in the rust,
And hands that lift to the skies, a sublime bird, a flower!
There, the good faith! There, the arms, fleshy apple,
Wood, sweet earth, the skin of solid gold!

The plagues will settle in the meadows,
Like eddies of the clouds, under cloudy shadows,
The tired sun, the reproached by all, ill-conceived; 
My spring evening is ale and fire-light,
And winter will come knocking at ten doors.

In the silence, the owl hoots its bitter song,
A grave fable of despair, the flower at dawn fails,
The world rests enslaved in this divine space,
And the void that I love cradles me, grieves me!

Oh I love my dark, divine solitude!
I will go to drink the peaceful peppermint beneath
The glorious sun of tenderness. My soul
Is at once mine and another's!
I will wander full of music-like honey, blind cat!  
I will fill a bag with faith, the horizon all along it!  
And I will rise, finally tired with disbelief!

- Arthur Rimbaud
