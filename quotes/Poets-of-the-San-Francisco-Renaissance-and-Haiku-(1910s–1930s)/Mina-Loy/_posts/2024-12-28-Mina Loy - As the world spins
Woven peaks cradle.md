Woven peaks cradle"

author: Mina Loy
quote: "As the world spins,
Woven peaks cradle the dusk,
Mountains, guardians of time,
Holding whispers of ancient winds,
Their shadows embrace valleys,
Where the winds ’courage' meets the flowers,
Each petal a tapestry of colors,
A solemn awe suspended,
Nature's artistry forever unfurls,
A symphony of earth and stone."

As the world spins,
Woven peaks cradle the dusk,
Mountains, guardians of time,
Holding whispers of ancient winds,
Their shadows embrace valleys,
Where the winds ’courage' meets the flowers,
Each petal a tapestry of colors,
A solemn awe suspended,
Nature's artistry forever unfurls,
A symphony of earth and stone.

- Mina Loy
