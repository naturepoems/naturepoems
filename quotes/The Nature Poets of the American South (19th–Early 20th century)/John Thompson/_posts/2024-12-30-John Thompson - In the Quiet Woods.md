In the Quiet Woods

Where the tall pines stand,
And the shadows play,
The woods hold their breath,
As the night meets the day.

A chorus of crickets,
In the warm evening air,
In harmony sing,
Of peace everywhere.

Oh woods, gentle woods,
With your secrets to share,
You cradle our hearts,
In a soft, tender care.

- John Thompson
