In the quiet of the night, I step outside,
A sky filled with jagged stars,
Each one a voice calling to the moon.
Let it wash over me, I think,
This celestial dance, illuminating
The edges of the earth, the mountains distant,
Breathless in their breathtaking solitude.
When dawn breaks, it is a sacred retreat,
As nature weaves dreams back into light,
And the echoes of night linger,
A soft serenade to the higher peaks
That remember what it means to hope,
To rise, to wake once more.

â€” "Celestial Serenade"

- James Wright
