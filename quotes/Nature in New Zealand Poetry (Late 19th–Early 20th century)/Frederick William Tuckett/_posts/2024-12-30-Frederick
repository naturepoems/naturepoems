The Dawn

In the hush of the early, fragrant light,  
As the stars fade away from the deepening night,  
The blush of the dawn begins to unfold,  
In waves of pink and of amber and gold.

The birds wake singing, a sweet serenade,  
And the world is adorned in this soft, tender shade;  
As the shadows retreat, and the day starts anew,  
In the breath of the morning, hope rises like dew.

So cherish the dawn, with its delicate grace,  
The promise it brings, in each shimmering space;  
For life’s sweetest moments, in colors so fair,  
Are found in the dawn, where the heart laid bare.

- Frederick William Tuckett
