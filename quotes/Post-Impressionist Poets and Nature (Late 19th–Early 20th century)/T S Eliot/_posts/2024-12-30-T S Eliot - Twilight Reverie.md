Whispers of the night, and the stars that gleam,  
   The moon granting wishes, like dreams that we dream.  
   The scent of the earth, rich and profound,  
   In the garden of twilight, our souls are unbound.
   
   In the stillness, we hear the soft sighs of trees,  
   Breathing stories of time in a rustling breeze.  
   Nature's heart beats with an ancient grace,  
   A sacred dance, in this enchanted place.

- T S Eliot
