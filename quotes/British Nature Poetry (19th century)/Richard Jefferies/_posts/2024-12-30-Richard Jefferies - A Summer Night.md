A Summer Night
The summer night is calm and still,

With moonlight bathing every hill,

Stars wink down like diamonds bright,

In a gentle dance of pure delight.

Whispers of grass and hush of trees,

Come carried softly on the breeze,

The world sleeps on in lovely grace,

Nestled close in natureâ€™s embrace.

- Richard Jefferies
