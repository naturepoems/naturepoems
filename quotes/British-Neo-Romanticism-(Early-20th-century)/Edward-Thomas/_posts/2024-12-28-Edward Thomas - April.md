April

The most ethereal of all months,
When days grow longer and winds take flight.
The earth doth wake from winter's sponce,
And nature spreads her smiles alight.

Oh, how the flowers dare to bloom,
And love endures within each heart;
The woods ignite with joy's perfume,
To feel the touch of spring impart.

In fields we walk, a dance divine,
To revel in the light of day;
As laughter whispers, we entwine,
In the warmth and joy of nature's play.

- Edward Thomas
