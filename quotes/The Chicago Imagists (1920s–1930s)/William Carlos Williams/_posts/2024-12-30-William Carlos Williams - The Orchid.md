The Orchid

My love is

a wounded man

a woman that cries

My love is

a child’s mind

dreaming of wax

glass and     cedar.  

Oh how she aches

years ago  simmers

the last heat

from the heart under

all the red fog.

Do you remember
the misty

brown of your own garden

years ago,  love?

In the blue twilight.

Endless departures at sail!

In vain will we lead

the orchid window,  

circling vapors

like the sun that holds

bitter waters.

Perhaps it will return.

A coldliness falls

over me when I see

her flowing away.

And the sun

bends back to the light.

Above the doors.

~~He reaches toward

the rippling birth...

the slight embarkations.

~~I kiss it with

for the golden hour.
 That will be alright!.


- William Carlos Williams
