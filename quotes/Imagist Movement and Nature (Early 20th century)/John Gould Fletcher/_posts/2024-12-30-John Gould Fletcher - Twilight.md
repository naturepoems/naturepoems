Twilight
As twilight falls like velvet,
And stars sprinkle the dusk,
The world quiets into a breath,
The colors fade, gently blurred,
While shadows stretch and yawn,
Night wraps the landscape in a hush,
A moment caught in the deepening blue,
The promise of dreams awaiting,
As the day gently surrenders to night.


- John Gould Fletcher
