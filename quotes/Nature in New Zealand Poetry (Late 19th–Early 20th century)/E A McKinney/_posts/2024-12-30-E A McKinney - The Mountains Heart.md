The Mountain’s Heart

Tall and proud, the mountain stands,
A sentinel forged by ancient hands,
Veiled in mists, her secrets kept,
In crags and valleys, the silence slept.

Her heart beats slow, beneath the stone,
In rivers glinting, her power shown,
With every sunrise, her face aglow,
Whispers of ages in each bend below.

Mighty, she watches, steadfast and true,
As seasons dance in a vibrant hue,
And though the stars might sparkle so bright,
It’s here in her shadow, we find our light.
