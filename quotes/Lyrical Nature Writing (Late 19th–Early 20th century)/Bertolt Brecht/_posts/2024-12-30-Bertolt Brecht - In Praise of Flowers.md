In Praise of Flowers

They bloom for us,
in every color,
a symphony of light,
a riot of hues,
in crevices and cracks,
they pulse with life,
and give joy to the eyes.

Oh, beautiful petals!
Hear the silent music,
the dances of insects,
who share in your glory,
your scent, your sway.

Each blossom whispers,
that life is fleeting,
a perfect moment,
an eternity captured,
aching heart clad
in soft petals, a pure
glimpse of the universe.

- Bertolt Brecht
