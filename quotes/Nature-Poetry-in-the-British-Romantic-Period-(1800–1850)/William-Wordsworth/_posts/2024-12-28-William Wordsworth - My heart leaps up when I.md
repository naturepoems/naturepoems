My heart leaps up when I behold
A rainbow in the sky:
So was it when my life began;
So is it now I am a man;
So be it when I shall grow old,
Or let me die!

Before my very eyes the clouds
And rainbows in the air,
And mingling in the light of hope
With golden beams entwined,
From day to day, from night to night
I shall embrace the fair.

- William Wordsworth
