Oh, that I could be
As dead leaves that in woodlands lie,
So still, so hushed, beneath the trees
As evening sets in clear and high.
When trees bend low their arms, and when
The sweet breeze is gone silently singing,
And all things meet in perfect harmony,
To the sound of voices in solitude ringing.

- John Keats
