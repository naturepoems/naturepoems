Under the starry ocean,
you glide, O silver fish,
moving like a thought,
subtle and fierce.
Depths undulate,
where the dark waters sing,
teach me your rhythms
of balance and dream.
As you splash through
nature’s moving stillness,
I wish to be part
of your quiet domain,
a heartbeat, a flicker,
a breath of cool air,
and glide in the currents,
clear as the sky
upon your freedom,
soft as a shadow.
