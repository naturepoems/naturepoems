The mountain peaks, a silent throne,
Where eagles soar and secrets lie,
In nature’s grandeur, one feels not alone,
The heart draws strength from the open sky.

Rivers carve paths through stone and time,
As the sun sets in a fiery blaze,
A symphony, a timeless rhyme,
In the echo of the evening’s gaze.

- Richard Wagner
