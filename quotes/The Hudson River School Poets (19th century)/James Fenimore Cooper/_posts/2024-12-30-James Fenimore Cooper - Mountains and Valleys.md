The mountains so stately,
   In their garments of snow,
With the silence of ages
   Where the proud eagles go.

And the valleys that cradle
   The streams of delight,
They beckon the wanderer
   Through the day and the night.

In the grandeur of Nature,
   I find peace and repose,
Where the spirit soars high
   As the river wind flows.

- James Fenimore Cooper
