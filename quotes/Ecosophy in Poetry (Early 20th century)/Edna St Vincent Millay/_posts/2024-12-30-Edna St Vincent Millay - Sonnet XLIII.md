Sonnet XLIII  
  ------------  
There comes to me, from a far-off land,  
  A chill that is the wind  
Across the land of a summer day,  
When I look around and see  
The earth suspended in soft light  
And the colors are bright,  
The woods are green and full,  
  And I hear the sound of the stream  
That flows with murmurs low,  
  And the flowers in bloom,  
I cannot bear to think of you and the snow  
  As you turn away.  


- Edna St Vincent Millay
