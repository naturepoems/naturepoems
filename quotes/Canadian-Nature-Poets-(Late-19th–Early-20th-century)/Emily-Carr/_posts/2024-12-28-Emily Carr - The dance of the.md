The dance of the berry,
A color-bright nymph,
With the sweet scent of summer
A nectar’s own glimpse.
Intricately woven,
The gifts of the vines,
In the heart of the meadows,
The wild garden shines.

Each blossom a promise,
Each fruit tells a tale,
Of the gifts of the harvest,
Of the winds and the trails.
In the music of petals,
In the lift of each leaf,
I taste a deep joy,
In this wilderness, relief.

- Emily Carr
