A river flows, a winding path,
Through verdant hills that kiss the sky,
It flows with strength, it flows with wrath,
In its embrace, all fears comply.

With every bend, the world we see,
Reflections dance, a moment's grace,
In nature's arms, we long to be,
To feel the pulse, to find our place.

- John Rea
