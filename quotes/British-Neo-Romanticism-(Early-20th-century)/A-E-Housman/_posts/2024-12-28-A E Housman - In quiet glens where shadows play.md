In quiet glens where shadows play,  
The willows weep beside the brook;  
In nature’s hand, the light of day  
Inspires the soul, like a storybook.

The distant hills with peaks aglow,  
The fragrance of the earth, a gift;  
With every breath, the love we show,  
In nature’s heart, our spirits lift.

- A E Housman
