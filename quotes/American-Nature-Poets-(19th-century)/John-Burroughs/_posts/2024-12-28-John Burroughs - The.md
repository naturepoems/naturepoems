The Dawning

Softly, softly the dawn unfolds,
   With a blush like a timid bride;
A shiver runs through the griping cold,
   And the day begins to glide.
The shadows flee from the light’s embrace,
   And the world wakes up to a new day’s race,
With beauty and hope in its firm hold,
   As nature’s charm becomes unveiled, bold.

- John Burroughs
