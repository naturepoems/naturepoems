The Winter's Breath
Frosty breath on windowpanes,
Winter drapes the world in white,
A quiet hush, soft snowflakes' reign,
Every flake a diamond's light.

Beneath the canvas, life sleeps still,
Awaiting spring's warm, awakening song,
In the chill, our hearts can fill,
With dreams of where we belong.

- Aasta Holth
