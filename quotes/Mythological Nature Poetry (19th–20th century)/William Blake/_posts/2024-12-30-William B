The Sick Rose  

O Rose, thou art sick!  
The invisible worm  
That flies in the night,  
In the howling storm:  

Has found out thy bed  
Of crimson joy:  
And his dark secret love  
Does thy life destroy.  

O Rose, thou art sick!  
The invisible worm  
That flies in the night,  
In the howling storm:  

Has found out thy bed  
Of crimson joy:  
And his dark secret love  
Does thy life destroy.  

O Rose, thou art sick!  
A secret love,  
That doth for ever lie,  
Secret and full of woeful sighs.  

And no joy can come:  
But thou dost go,  
And bloom in thy bed,  
Enchant me through and through!  

O Rose, thou art sick.

- William Blake
