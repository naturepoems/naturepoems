The sea was a water of lilies,
The sky a dome of cooing doves.
How delightful was this tranquillity,
Breath of nature, on my lips.

The imagined blue, held in my golden mind;
Scent of blooms held in my thoughts.
Here, the day was justice and joy,
Evening transformed the light to peace.

- Anna de Noailles
