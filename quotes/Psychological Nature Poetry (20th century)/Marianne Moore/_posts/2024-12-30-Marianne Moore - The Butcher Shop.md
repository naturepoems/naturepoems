The Butcher Shop

Composed as sure
and down pools,
of threads for space,
gathers wind and meat,
these drape warm glimmers. 

Its forks expect hire, 
each satin blade wonders,
the grease and that which sits
among crumbled air,
its angle tales let fall
each promise evolving ground
as what you see.


- Marianne Moore
