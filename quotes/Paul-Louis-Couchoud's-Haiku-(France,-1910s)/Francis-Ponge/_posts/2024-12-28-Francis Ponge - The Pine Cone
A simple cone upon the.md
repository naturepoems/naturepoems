A simple cone upon the forest floor,
Worn by the seasons, yet holds such mystery,
Layers upon layers, stories to unfold,
The whispers of the wind, the secrets it keeps."

The Pine Cone
A simple cone upon the forest floor,
Worn by the seasons, yet holds such mystery,
Layers upon layers, stories to unfold,
The whispers of the wind, the secrets it keeps.
