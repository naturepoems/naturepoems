The River

The river sings as it flows,
it carries the shadow of trees,
  glints off the surface,
though we just see blur,
a memory of movement,
yet each drop finds its path;
  solemn and soft,
totally absorbed,
as life lets go, and carries on,
the winding through life—
laughter finds itself here;
  beckons down the stream.


- Robert Creeley
