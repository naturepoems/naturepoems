There's beauty in the falling leaves,
A tale of stories intertwined;
Their dance, a reminder it deceives,
For every end, new life youâ€™ll find.

The autumn paints the world in gold,
Regret and hope within its fold;
Oh, nature's cycle, wise and clear,
In loss, the seeds of life appear.

- Joyce Kilmer
