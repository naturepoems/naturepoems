A dusk in the spring,
With a steady hush of love,
Bring the things of the world
To a waiting pause.

In the oak branches above,
A small bird calls,
And then softly vanishes
Into the dusk,
Where the shade closes in
And all prayer is known.

Oh, take each moment,
Green it with a breath,
And sweeten the soft dusk,
For your hands and your heart,
For the balance of us all.


- Carl Sandburg
