---

There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
There is society where none intrudes,
By the deep sea, and the music in its roar;

I love not man less, but Nature more,
From these our interviews, in which I steal
From all I may be, or have been before,
To mingle with the Universe, and feel
What I can ne’er express, yet cannot all conceal.

I will walk where my own nature would be leading:
It vexes me to choose another guide:
Where the grey flocks in wildness are a-breeding,
And the vast ocean, stretching far and wide,
Carries upon its wave life’s burden, that wont abide.

- Matthew Arnold
