Reflections in the Pond
The pond lies tranquil, clear, and deep,
Where lilies float on liquid glass;
In pensive thought, the willows weep,
As sunbeams dance and moments pass.

The sky’s reflection, soft and bright,
A tapestry of softest hues,
The birds, like echoes lost in flight,
Compose their symphony of blues.

Here, in this still, enchanting place,
Where every ripple tells a tale,
Life breathes anew in Nature’s grace,
And weds our thoughts where dreams prevail.

—Charles Tenney Jackson
