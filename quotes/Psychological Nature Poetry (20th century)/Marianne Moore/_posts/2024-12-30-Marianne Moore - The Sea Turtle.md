The Sea Turtle

In the air above,
a turtle holds their head,
so there's gentle shade who
open up in the tranquil waters;
where paddles greet each hidden rest.
Then sequence that strand to acquire.

Each release of wander,
this marks with flow till
dead folded coils burst.
The clove that capsizes instant,
a soul stupidity, aside from sows.

Were the eggs opalescent,
take down bright white in the fresh grid,
crossed surface she goes 
and passed once left.


- Marianne Moore
