I wander through the fields again,
O, let those sweet days renew,
The chance for rest from the noise and din,
Where every light found is like a dew!

Take that play of the budding trees,
Lapsing wind’s song in harmony,
Showers of light in the rail’s long ease—
A broad chest open with seed like me.

So come to me, golden as night,
So tell me the sweet fields, I earn
To see the blossom grow as right—
Beauty of nature indeed I yearn!

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
