Frosted Morning

In frosted morning's tender grace,
Where nature wears a silver lace,
The world awakens, crisp and bright,
In every corner, pure delight.

The breath of winter, sharp and clear,
Each moment holds a glimpse of cheer.
Nature calls in whispers, sweet,
To dance along with every beat.

- Sergei Yesenin
