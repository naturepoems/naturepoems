The Clouds

The clouds drift lazily above,
A quilt of white against the blue,
They shift and change, a dreamlike dance,
In every shape, a moment new.

A soft caress of sunlight breaks,
Upon their forms, and in their hue,
I find the beauty in their flight,
Like thoughts of joy that wander through.


- Anna Akhmatova
