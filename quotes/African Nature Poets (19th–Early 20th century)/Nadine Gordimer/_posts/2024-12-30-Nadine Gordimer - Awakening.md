In spring the world awakens,
filled with the fragrance of precursors,
the newness of the universe,
a symphony in green,
each leaf a note sung by the earth.

Rivers run quicker,
feeding the lands and spirits,
and the air, oh the air!
Clear and persistent,
it stirs our hearts,
sings a hymn to life,
recalling the past,
yearning for the infinite.

- Nadine Gordimer
