Aspens
Boldly they stood, still softly expressing
With all their leaves a sign of attending,
And the sigh of the wind they feel, indwelling,
Awake to day’s hurry, their lesson unending.

What calls the heart from the noise around
And finds it in fears and hopes profound?
Each root curled, nature’s sacred bond,
Not just a pasture but a world unbound.

- Edward Thomas
