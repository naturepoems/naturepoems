Mountains rise like giants, bold and grand,
Guardians of stories that time has spanned.
Their peaks touch the heavens, their roots delve deep,
In their timeless presence, my heart learns to weep.

Rivers carve their paths with an artist's grace,
Reflecting the beauty of a world in embrace.
Each ripple a journey, each current a song,
In nature's vast symphony, I feel I belong.
