The Forest

Within the ancient wood, I roam,
With sigh of trees, I find my home,
Their arms extend, protect with grace,
In tapestry of shadows trace.

Each step invokes a whisper here,
Among the ferns, all seem so clear,
As nature hums her perfect tune,
And serves the earth with silvered moon.

The heart finds wisdom in the bark,
While in the dark, where life’s aglow,
A path that leads with well-trod mark,
With every sigh, in peace I sow.

- Dorothy Wordsworth
