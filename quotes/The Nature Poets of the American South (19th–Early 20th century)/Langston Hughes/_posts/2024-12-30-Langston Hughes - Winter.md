Winter
When the wind is cold,
and the woods are bare,
what will the birds do?
They will not sing.
They will not be with us  
This winter.
When the wind is harsh,
and the trees are dry,
Let me sing for you in the cold.
Let me sing for the night sky
for the long, long night.
Let me sing of the falling snow.
Let me sing of the starry sky!



- Langston Hughes
