This Living Hand 
This living hand, now warm and capable 
Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold 
And in the icy grip of death, be ready 
Yet to be climbed upon, its truth to hold. 
Ah! How this lifeless form, the art of man, 
Could still embrace me, touch the shores of time. 
Such beauty flows in nature, still but grand, 
An echo sweet, that murmurs through the climb.

- John Keats
