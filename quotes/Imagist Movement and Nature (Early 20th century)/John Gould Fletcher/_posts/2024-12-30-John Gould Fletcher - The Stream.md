The Stream
The stream flows with a purpose,
Carving its path through the stone,
Each ripple a soft-spoken promise,
To carry the earth's heart home.
Sylvan whispers travel on the current,
As branches bow like ancient friends,
And the water plays its melody,
A lullaby for the woods,
Nurturing life, a gentle thread,
In the fabric of all things.


- John Gould Fletcher
