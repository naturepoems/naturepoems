The Silent Woods

In the silent woods, where stillness reigns,
And time feels suspended, a breath held tight,
I find a sanctuary that eases my pains,
Where shadows and light weave a fabric of night.

The grandeur of trees, with their branches so wide,
Stand guard over secrets that nature keeps, 
As I wander the trails, my heart opens wide,
To the beauty in silence, where the spirit leaps.

For here in the woods, Iâ€™m alive and awake,
And the world at a distance begins to unfurl,
In the quiet retreat, every breath that I take,
Is a promise of life, a soft, gentle whirl.

- John Burroughs
