Beneath the Canopy

Beneath the broad and tangled leaves,
I wander through this sacred grove,
Where light darts like a playful sprite,
And shadows weave a story told.

The air is thick with scents of earth,
Of loam and bloom, of life anew,
Here, time itself seems to uncoil,
A soft embrace, a gentle cue.

Each step I take is laced with wonder,
As nature whispers its sweet song,
In every rustle, the heart takes flight,
Here beneath the canopy, I belong.

- Torrenti Orazio
