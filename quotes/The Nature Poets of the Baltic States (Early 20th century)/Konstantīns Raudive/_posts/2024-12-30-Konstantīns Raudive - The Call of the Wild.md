The Call of the Wild

In the hush of the forest,
Where silence cradles the heart,
I hear the call of the wild,
Echoing through the trees,
A summons to the untamed soul.

The rustle of leaves,
The snap of branches,
Whispers of life abound,
Narrating tales of survival,
In this symphony of nature.

I am drawn to the wild,
In its fierce beauty I find,
A reflection of my spirit,
And in its embrace,
I discover the pulse of freedom.

- Konstantīns Raudive
