Spring

Here are the great clouds, white against the blue;  
And afar from the tree-top blooms  
The small bird towns, past beauties of the hollowsâ€”  
Over the fields, away,  
For the sun rustles within, and all is bright!  
Here, the promise of our seasons come,  
A light that flowers like petals through the town,  
And love is in the house, behind the lighted air,  
With the day on spread below!

- Lesbia Harford
