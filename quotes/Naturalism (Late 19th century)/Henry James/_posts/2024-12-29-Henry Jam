Underneath the starlit sky, the world is so vast,
Each twinkle a story, a dream yet to weave;
In the silence of night, I find treasures amassed,
The poetry of nature, in which hearts believe.

Every shadow a whisper, a soft serenade,
As I drift through this night, in the moonlight’s soft gleam;
In the grandeur of all, I am unafraid—
For the beauty of nature inspires each dream.


- Henry James
