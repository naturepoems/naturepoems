The Cherry Trees

Now, in the golden evening light,
The cherry trees are in full bloom.
They blossom, white as untouched snow,
And scent the air, fragrant with perfume.

The petals flutter down like rain,
A soft and tender whisper of spring,
While bees hum low in busy lanes,
And birds of joy their sweet song sing.

In this quiet, peaceful grove,
I find my heart in rapture lost,
For spring has come, with gentle love,
In cherry trees, I am embossed.


- Edward Thomas
