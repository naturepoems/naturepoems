Beneath the arch of ancient oaks,
Where echoes of forgotten lore,
Unfold in ripples on the brook,
I dance where summer’s warmth once stored.
The air is drunk with sunlight’s kiss,
And shadows play in golden hue,
Each step a prayer, a whispered wish,
To the world that sings so true.
In the labyrinth of wildflowers,
I feel the threads of life entwine,
Nature wraps her arms around,
As each heart sings, each soul divine.

- Marina Tsvetaeva
