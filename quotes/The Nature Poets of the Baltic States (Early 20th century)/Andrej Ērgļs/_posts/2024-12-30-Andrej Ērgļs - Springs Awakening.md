Blossoms burst with spring's sweet kiss,  
Awakening the slumbered earth,  
Each petal sings a fragrant tune,  
Celebrating life, rebirth.

The gentle rain bestows a gift,  
Kissing soil to stir the seed,  
While rivers swell with joyful cheer,  
In nature’s dance, the heart is freed.

The vibrant hues of life arise,  
In gardens lush and meadows fair,  
As every creature finds its place,  
In this awakening affair.

- Andrej Ērgļs
