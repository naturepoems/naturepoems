I found a Flower, wild and free  
That blooms a sight divine –  
With colors all in different hues –  
With nectar so divine –  

It swayed and danced with Summer air  
And stirred about the ground –  
A kingdom of its very own –  
By Nature’s hand, profound –  

Oh, take my breath! –  
And wrap it round –  
Embracing all that Fruit does yield  
And it shall always be, profound. –  


- Emily Dickinson
