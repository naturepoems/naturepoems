The mountains rise with majesty,
  Their peaks adorned with winter’s crown,
  In every valley, tranquil sea,
  Where eagles soar, and sun goes down.

Let nature’s grandeur lift your soul,
  To see beyond the worldly strife,
  In every crag and mighty roll,
  You’ll find the essence of pure life.

- Isaak Walton
