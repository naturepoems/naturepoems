From the glaciers down to the rivers,
Nature scars its face, endlessly dynamic,
While the machines of the future,
Join the symphony of time's transcendence.

Every drop of water whispers the journey,
As rock becomes liquid, projects harmony,
Together weaving a fervent tapestry,
Melding mechanical dreams with primordial essence.

Let the wild collide with the man-made,
And form new landscapes ripe with hope,
Where the rhythm of the waves becomes the pulse,
In this brave celebration of infinity!

- FT Marinetti
