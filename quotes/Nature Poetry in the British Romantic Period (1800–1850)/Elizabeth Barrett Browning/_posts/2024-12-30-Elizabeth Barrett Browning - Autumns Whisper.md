The autumn leaves, like whispers glide,
Across the path, where dreams reside;
In every shade of gold and red,
A symphony of life is spread.

The brisk air speaks of seasons change,
While nature’s canvas does arrange;
Each falling leaf a story told,
Of summer days, of warmth grown cold.

Yet, beauty dwells within decay,
As life prepares for winter’s sway.
In every cycle, every phase,
Resides the light of hopeful days.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
