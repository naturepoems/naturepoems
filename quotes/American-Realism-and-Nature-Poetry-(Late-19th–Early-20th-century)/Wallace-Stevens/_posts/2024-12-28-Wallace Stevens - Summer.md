Summer Night

The bushes are in leaf, and the trees
In leaf, and there is a hum
Of night and the air is warm.
And my sadness is like a shadow,
It is the memory of things
told in the light
towards the end of the night.

I see it fling itself about.
Time intoxicates and excesses itself
On the night.

The moon flits among the pines,
Stars rise like unspent prayers,
Wherever I turn, I see
Only the great beauty of wood.

The wildness enclosed in leaves
With the silence of space,
Only as I look back, I see
The dark and hollow ball of the heart.


- Wallace Stevens
