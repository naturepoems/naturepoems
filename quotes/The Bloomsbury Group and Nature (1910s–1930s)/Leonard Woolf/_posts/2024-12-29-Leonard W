A whisper floats on morning air,  
As sunlight gently spills,  
It dances on the dewdrops there,  
A mirage that forever thrills.  

With every blade of grass that bends,  
I feel the heartbeat of the earth,  
In simple truths, life transcends,  
In every moment, joy and worth.  

Let me forever cherish this,  
This bond with nature ever near,  
For in its beauty, there’s a bliss,  
That fills my heart with love, sincere.

- Leonard Woolf
