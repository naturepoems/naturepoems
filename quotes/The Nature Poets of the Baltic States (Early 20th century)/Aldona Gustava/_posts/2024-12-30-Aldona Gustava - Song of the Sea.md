Song of the Sea
Waves crash against the rugged shore,
A lullaby for souls in awe,
The ocean's breath, forever more,
In salty air, we find our laws.

Seagulls cry in wild abandon,
Their flight a dance upon the breeze,
In the embrace of waterâ€™s hand,
The vastness whispers through the trees.

- Aldona Gustava
