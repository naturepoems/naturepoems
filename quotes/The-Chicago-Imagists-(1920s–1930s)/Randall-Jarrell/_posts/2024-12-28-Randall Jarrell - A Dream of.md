A Dream of Trees
    When they grow, when they stop,
    Cast, Strangled. In every creature,
    Every sound, they are huge.
    Like the roots, stones, and moss.

    A canopy of shadow,
    Each leaf a mirror caught,
    Each tree a towering soul,
    Whispering this eternal when.

- Randall Jarrell
