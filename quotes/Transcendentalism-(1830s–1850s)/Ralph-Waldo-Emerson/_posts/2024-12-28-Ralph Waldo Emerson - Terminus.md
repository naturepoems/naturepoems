Terminus

   The year’s at the spring,
   And day’s at the morn;
   Morning’s at seven;
   The hill-side’s dew-pearl’det,
   The balloons of the breath of morn.

   The year’s at the spring,
   And homeward bound it brings;
   The heart is youngest,
   When Nature’s poets begin to sing,
   For the woods—all that is fair in shared wings.

                                                        —Ralph Waldo Emerson
