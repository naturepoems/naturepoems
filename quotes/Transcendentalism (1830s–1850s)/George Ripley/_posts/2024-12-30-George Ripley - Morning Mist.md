In the morning mist     
The dew hangs on the leaves,  
The stillness fills the air,  
And the world wakes slow,  
Glistening with each drop of life.

The brook stirs softly,  
Whispers to the stone,  
The shadows dance in light,  
And nature speaks alone,  
With tones that only silence knows.


- George Ripley
