The Fox

The fox is much cherished,
Yet ceaselessly at work  
Amidst the blooms and shadows,
Affecting the lost woods' sanctum;

Unravels the quiet  
In which he parlies, bounded where
The fragile landscape strews  
Tastes all its meanings intended.

On those white heights; trembling
Against the static curtain of  
His body, and where he waits
In persistent lucidity.


- Marianne Moore
