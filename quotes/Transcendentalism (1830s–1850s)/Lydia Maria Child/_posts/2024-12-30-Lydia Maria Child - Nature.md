NATURE

Nature’s father, thou art all,
Filling valley, hill and stream,
With health and joy, leaves, birds, and flowers,
And we but live in thee, our dream!

The water dances merrily,
The flowers bloom in bright array,
Oh brighter than the summer sun,
Are hearts that greet thy warm display!

Thy tapestry of green and gold,
Each stroke a summons to behold,
The grandeur of thy endless love,
In earth, in skies, in stars above.

- Lydia Maria Child
