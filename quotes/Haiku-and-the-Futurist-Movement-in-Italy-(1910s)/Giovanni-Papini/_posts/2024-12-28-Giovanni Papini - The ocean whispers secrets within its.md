Stroking the shores with timeless caresses.
A dance of the waves, where serenity hides,
In harmony's heartbeat, the spirit confesses."

The ocean whispers secrets within its tides,
Stroking the shores with timeless caresses.
A dance of the waves, where serenity hides,
In harmony's heartbeat, the spirit confesses.
