Windswept Fields

Out beyond the bustling world,
farm fields extend like memories,
a patchwork quilt of green and gold.
Windswept grasses dance,
whispering tales of seasons past,
a chorus that echoes through the air.

Sunsets bleed into horizons,
while cicadas serenade the night,
every heartbeat of the earth,
a reminder of labor and love,
where the roots of time run deep,
and the soil cradles hopes anew.

- Cecilia Ludovica Morandini
