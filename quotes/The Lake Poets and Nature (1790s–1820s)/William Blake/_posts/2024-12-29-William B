To the Evening Star

Thou fair-haired angel of the evening,
Now descending from the skies!
Now the grateful period is given,
To the world’s end, pray arise.

Let thy golden imperfection,
Shed a light of silver gleam;
Now read Eden’s light and glory,
To night’s bright pearl of dreams!

- William Blake
