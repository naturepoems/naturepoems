A Winter’s Night

The moon hangs low in the sky's embrace,
While crystal stars in silence peep,
The world is wrapped in a cold lace,
As the hush of nature drifts to sleep.

The fir trees stand in sentinel grace,
Peering through a mantle of white,
Each branch a dream, each shadow a trace,
Of the magic born this winter’s night.

Oh, let the chill fill the spirit whole,
While warmth dwells in a hearth's soft glow,
For nature’s beauty shall soothe the soul,
And cradle the heart from cold and woe.

- Amelia Welby
