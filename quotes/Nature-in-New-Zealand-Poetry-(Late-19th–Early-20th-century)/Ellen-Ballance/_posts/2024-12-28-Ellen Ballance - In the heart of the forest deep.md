In the heart of the forest deep,  
Where sunlight filters through the green,  
A tapestry of life unfolds,  
Mossy stones, and ferns that lean,  
The silence speaks of ancient times,  
Of spirits that roam beneath the pines,  
And every rustle, every sigh,  
Is nature's hymn, forever nigh.

- Ellen Ballance
