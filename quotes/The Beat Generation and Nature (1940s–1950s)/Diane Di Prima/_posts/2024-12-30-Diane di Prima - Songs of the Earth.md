Songs of the Earth

The songs of the earth
are hidden in plain sight,
falling like notes from
the sky,
in the laughter of children,
in the rustling leaves,
the pulse of the river,

in each wave that crashes,
each pebble turned,
we hear the whisper
of creation.

Let’s listen closer,
don’t let your heart die,
finding caverns of beauty
in each footstep taken,
in the sprawling fields,
in the urban jungle,

the heart beats louder,
you will find me there,
where joy mingles with sorrow,
a gentle reminder,
that we are rooted in love,
a thread in everything,
a song worth singing.


- Diane di Prima
