The forest is the dark womb
    of the world
        of flesh and light
The birth of trees
    and the sun shining on
        that flesh
and falling in a
    delicate
        whisper of silence.

To walk there
    is to know soft
        night
To know the essence
    of the hidden.

O bird of the moon
            dance for me!

- Michael McClure
