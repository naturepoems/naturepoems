There are no 50/50 cases
In this world of black and white,
Do it right or let it go,
And heed the day's fading light.

A solitary bird alights,
To sing a song, or so it seems;
An echo through the shadowed leaves,
A whispering of lost dreams.

To wander through the countryside,
In the chill of autumn air,
Is also to recall the joy
Of life upon a dare.

- Robert Frost
