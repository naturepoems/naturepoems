What If

What if the spirit of the leaves,
Was all the wind could ever glean?
What if the very knowledge shown,
In sunlight made the dark fitz begin?

See the dogs racing on flowered hills,
Where night draws its gnomon shades to sketch;
And in the folds of the well-worn trails,
Nature listens to cosmic events enmesh.

- Ezra Pound
