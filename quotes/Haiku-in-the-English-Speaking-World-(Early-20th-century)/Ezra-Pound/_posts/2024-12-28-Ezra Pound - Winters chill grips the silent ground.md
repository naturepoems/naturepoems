author: Ezra Pound
quote: "Winter’s chill grips the silent ground,  
   crystals adorn the sleeping trees,  
   nature rests in quietude.
    
   The stars are bright against the dark,  
   a promise of warmth to come,  
   in the heart of frost, life lingers still."

Winter’s chill grips the silent ground,  
   crystals adorn the sleeping trees,  
   nature rests in quietude.
    
   The stars are bright against the dark,  
   a promise of warmth to come,  
   in the heart of frost, life lingers still.

- Ezra Pound
