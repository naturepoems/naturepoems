Nature's Heart

Beneath the azure sky, I tread,
Upon the paths where blossoms spread,
In fragrant forests, troubles fade,
In nature's heart, foundations laid.

The songs of birds, they serenade,
With whispers soft, sweet peace invades,
Each leaf a canvas, green displayed,
In harmony, life's dance portrayed.
