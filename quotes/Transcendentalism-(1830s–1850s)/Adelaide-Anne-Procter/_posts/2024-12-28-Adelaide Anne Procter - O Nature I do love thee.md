O Nature! I do love thee so,
   Thou art my life, my heart's delight;
Thy bosom hath a soft repose,
   Thy skies a stillness, calm and bright.

The murmur of the flowing stream,
   The whisper of the sighing trees,
The brightness of the sunny beam
   Are full of beauty, joy, and peace.

- Adelaide Anne Procter
