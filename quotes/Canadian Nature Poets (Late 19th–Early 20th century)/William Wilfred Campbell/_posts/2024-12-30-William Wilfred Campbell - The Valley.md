The Valley

In the valley green and low,
  There is peace and stillness rest;
  Where the gentle waters flow,
  And my heart feels ever blessed.

The whisper of the morning breeze,
  And the songs of birds so clear,
  Are mingling with the swaying trees,
  As I walk and linger here.

The vale is draped in tender light,
  With a promise in the air,
  And I find a forever bright,
  In the green world, fair and rare.

- William Wilfred Campbell
