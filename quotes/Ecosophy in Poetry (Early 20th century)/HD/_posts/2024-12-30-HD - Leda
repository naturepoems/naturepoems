Leda

A river was flowing, 
The sun kissed the sea, 
I felt its warmth as love. 

A swan rose up, 
It fluttered against the blue, 
And in that grace 
I knew my heart held something true. 

Yet the love of man, 
In shadows and whispers, 
Became my being, 
Echoing through the woods, 
Where the river's embrace 
Was soft but dear. 

O moving water, 
Cradle me in your depths, 
Where dreams swim, 
And the swan flew high.
