The Clouds

The clouds parade in glorious sight,  
As silver linings greet the light;  
They dance in elegance, bold and free,  
A wondrous play in the skies we see.

Each shape a story, each shroud a tale,  
Let whispers of the wind prevail;  
Within their folds, the memories bind,  
Of nature's grace, the colors combined.

- Hartley Coleridge
