The light of evening, falls across the sky,
And what a scene it paints where trees stand tall.
The soft wind breathes, and whispers lullabies,
Until the world is hushed, and darkness calls.

The colors fade to brown, then gray and dark,
As stars awake to burn in mystery.
But still, my heart holds fast this fading spark,
That nature’s pulse, a guide, will always be.

I walk beneath the branches thick and strong,
And find my solace there; my troubles cease.
For in the forest, I know I belong,
Wrapped in the earth’s embrace, a sense of peace.

- Robert Frost
