Give me the land, the trees, the sky,  
The rivers, the mountains, and the sea;  
For in their hearts my spirit meets,  
Each boundless moment, wild and free.  
 
Sing me the songs that nature wrote,  
In the whispers of the wind;  
And dance with the shadows through the light,  
Where all beginnings blend.

- Rudyard Kipling
