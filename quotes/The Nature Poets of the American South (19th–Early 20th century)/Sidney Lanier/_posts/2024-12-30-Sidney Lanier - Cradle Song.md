Cradle Song
Here in the shade of the cherry-trees,
  Wind-blown through a phantasy wide,
Mother-voices murmur with soft degrees,
  Lulling the laughter at their side.

But hark! the whisper of soft replies—
  From the lisp of dreams in the sway,
The luren sings where the bluebird flies,
  Under the vagueness of day.

- Sidney Lanier
