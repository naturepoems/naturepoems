A Summer Night

The summer night is softly dim—
  A calm that comes from stars,
  And twilight rests on nature’s rim,
  With joy in every breath.

The shadows of the trees arise,
  In silhouettes so rare,
  While the murmur of the evening sighs,
  An echo of the air.

Oh, let me drift with them to dreams,
  Where peace in silence weaves,
  And life lights up like silver beams,
  On breathing summer leaves!

- William Wilfred Campbell
