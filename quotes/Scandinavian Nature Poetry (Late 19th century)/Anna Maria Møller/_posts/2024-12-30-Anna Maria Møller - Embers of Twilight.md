Embers of Twilight

As daylight fades, the sky turns rose,
A canvas wide, where beauty glows,
With every sunset, a promise made,
In twilight's warmth, our fears allayed.

The chirp of crickets, a nightly tune,
Under the watchful eye of the moon,
In the whispers of night, dreams take flight,
As stars emerge, piercing the night.

In the hush of dusk, the day’s embrace,
In nature's wonders, we find our place,
With every heartbeat, the world does sigh,
In the dance of dusk, we learn to fly.


- Anna Maria Møller
