Mountain Reverie

In the embrace of the ancient peaks,
Where silence reigns and time stands still,
I feel the pulse of the wild earth,
A whispering force, a powerful thrill.

The rocky crags, the snow-capped tops,
Hold secrets of ages, long since passed,
In their shadows, I seek my truths,
A journey inward, destined, vast.

Each step is a prayer, a deepened breath,
In natureâ€™s cathedral, solace found,
Here, I lose and rediscover myself,
On this sacred altar, profound.

- Torrenti Orazio
