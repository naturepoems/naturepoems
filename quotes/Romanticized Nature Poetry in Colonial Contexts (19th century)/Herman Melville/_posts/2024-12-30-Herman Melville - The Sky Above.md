The Sky Above
Above, the sky, a canvas vast,
Tinted in shades of fiery flame,
As dusk drifts slowly, day moves past,
And dreams awaken, wild and tame.

With clouds that drift like thoughts in flight,
The softest whisper fills the air,
A secret shared with stars at night,
A universe of love laid bare.

Each shadow drawn, a memory bright,
Each color fused, a work of art,
For in this space of gentle light,
The truth of nature fills the heart.

So let me gaze, let my soul fly,
In freedom found, I feel the edge,
For in this moment, 'neath the sky,
I find my pledge, my blessed pledge.

â€” Excerpt from "The Sky Above" (not an actual poem of Melville)

- Herman Melville
