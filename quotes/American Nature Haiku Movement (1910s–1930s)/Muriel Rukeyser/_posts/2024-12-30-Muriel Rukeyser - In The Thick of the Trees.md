In the thick of the trees, 
new life twists through crags.
The roots stretch in secret
like veins toward the liquid center.

Moonlight dances on the water,
resting its well-weathered stones.
I sink like a mist under the branches,
finding songs that have never been sung.

All the measures pulled from silence,
yet I speak not of absence,
but of presence, of weathered smiles 
dancing atop the warmest of memories.

Each wind bluster 
apart — to mold the branches thinner,
each petal making promises,
knowing beauty cannot help
but emerge from the roughest overgrowth.

- Muriel Rukeyser
