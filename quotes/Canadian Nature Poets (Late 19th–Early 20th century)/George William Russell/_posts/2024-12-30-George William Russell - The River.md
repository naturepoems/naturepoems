The river flows, a silver thread,
Through meadows wide and free;
It sings a song of peace instead,
Of all the strife we see.
With every ripple, every bend,
It whispers of the past;
An echo of the time we spend,
In beauty unsurpassed.

So let us wander by its shore,
And watch the waters gleam;
For nature’s gift is evermore,
A never-fading dream.


- George William Russell
