In the stillness of the night,  
The moon awakens the whispering trees,  
Casting shadows that dance and sway,  
Under the watchful gaze of stars.

O gentle breeze, carry my thoughts,  
To the mountains where the rivers flow,  
And the heart of the earth beats profound,  
A hymn of nature, eternally sung.

- Thomas Mofolo
