At dawn, the world awakens,
With hues of pink and gold—
A canvas brushed by time.
Nature stretches and yawns,
As new days bring fresh promises,
And the universe sighs.

Each ray, a gentle nudge,
Each breeze, a soft caress,
Awakening the slumbering blooms,
In the hush of morning light,
Where beauty is born anew.


- Louise Bogan
