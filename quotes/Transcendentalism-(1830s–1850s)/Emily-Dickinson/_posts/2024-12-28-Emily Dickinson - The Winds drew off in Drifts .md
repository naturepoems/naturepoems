The Winds drew off in Drifts –  
The Cameo weartered eight,  
The Grass is high and soft –  
But nothing worn or straight.  

Not even a lawless day  
Can stiffen the Hunter's feasts,  
Through mazes in his grass  
Where I have thought quite sweet  

To sit, when summer sneaks  
And only wraps the throats –  
Of times, like Mirth,  
In breezes soothed,  
—Emily Dickinson
