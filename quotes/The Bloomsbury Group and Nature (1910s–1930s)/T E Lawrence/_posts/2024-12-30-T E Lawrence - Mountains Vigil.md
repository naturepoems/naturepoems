Upon the mountains, silence reigns,
   Wrapped in mists of softly woven skies.
   Here, every rock and stone retains
   The stories of the ages, wise.

   The river flows like time unbroken,
   A timeless track upon the land,
   And by its banks, mere words are spoken,
   In whispers of a gentle hand.

   The crags, the spruces, stand as sentinels,
   Guardians of the secrets held,
   In every breeze, a sweet farewell,
   Leaving tales of life, upheld.

- T E Lawrence
