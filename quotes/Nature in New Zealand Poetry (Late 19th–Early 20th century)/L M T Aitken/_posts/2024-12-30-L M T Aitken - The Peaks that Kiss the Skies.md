The peaks that kiss the skies of blue,
   Stand sentinel o’er vale and glen;
With crisp, cold air, a blessèd view,
   A world untouched by selfish men.

Each snow-capped summit, pure and bright,
   Reminds us of the power great;
In nature's grace, we find our light,
   And silence speaks, while hearts await.


- L M T Aitken
