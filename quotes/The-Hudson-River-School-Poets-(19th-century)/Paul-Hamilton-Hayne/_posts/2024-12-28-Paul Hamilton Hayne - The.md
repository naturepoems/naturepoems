The Stream

Murmuring, a silver coil,
Through the verdure glides away;
O’er the pebbled rocks it toils,
Singing cheery songs of play.

O, in thy gentle course, my friend,
I find a soft communion sweet,
From dawn till twilight’s tranquil end,
Thy whispering grace is my retreat.

- Paul Hamilton Hayne
