Whispers of Autumn

Autumn writhes in bright decay,
The crisp air crackles with a tune—
Leaves spiral down in joyful abandon,
While the earth sighs, wrapped in color's lure,
And every step I take is a promise,
Of new beginnings in the falling light,
For in this season of fading grace,
I find the ecstasy of life redefined.
