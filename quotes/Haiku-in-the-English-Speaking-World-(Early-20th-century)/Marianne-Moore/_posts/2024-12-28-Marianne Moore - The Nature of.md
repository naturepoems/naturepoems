The Nature of Truth
   It crawls like a snail,
   weighing each rock,
   each twist of the winding path,
   leaves a mark;
   it sings of stern lakes,
   considers the thorns,
   sees wet grass, mourning,
   cheerless, or bright;
   nature must laugh,
   this barren song,
   this hundred-voiced verse,
   must breatheâ€”
   truth is a fierce wind.
   As if one had seen the storm,
   the heavens, unconfined.

- Marianne Moore
