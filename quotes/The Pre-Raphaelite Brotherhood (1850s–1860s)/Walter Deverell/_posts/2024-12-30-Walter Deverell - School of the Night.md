SCHOOL OF THE NIGHT

The stars in clusters are a myriad crown,  
That tuneless night, it seems to whistle and moan;  
Yet from deep within the shadows all around,  
Come the thoughts of nature's own green grasses grown:  
Until at last the solemnity is prone,  
O'er land and sea, in silence thus we've sworn.


- Walter Deverell
