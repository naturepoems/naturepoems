Cedar
Cedar trees stand,
piercing the clouds,
their scents carried far,
roots entwined with valleys,
saving the dreams
of the winds that sweep,
and the whispers of water
that follow far into night.

Cedar, ancient one, strong,
hold us close in this life,
remind us of the journey,
to walk among the plains,
where the old spirits speak
of our future still.

— Gary Snyder
