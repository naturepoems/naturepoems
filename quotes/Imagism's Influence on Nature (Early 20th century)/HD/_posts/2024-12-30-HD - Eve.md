Eve

Love, I am struggling

between grace and the light;

the morning flower is brave,

it flowers between the stones

swayed by its glory.

I do not crusade

for the man in the night;

let the glory of the sun

come down upon him.

Each morning delivers my heart;  

crystal in the rocks,

I am yearning the last night,

to the moonâ€™s swimming pearl.
