Oh, gentle rain that falls so sweet,
In every drop, a rhythmic beat.
You cleanse the earth, and plant the seed,
A testament to nature's creed.

With every storm that shakes the ground,
A symphony of life resounds.
Embrace me with your tender grace,
In your cool breath, I find my place.


- Zora Neale Hurston
