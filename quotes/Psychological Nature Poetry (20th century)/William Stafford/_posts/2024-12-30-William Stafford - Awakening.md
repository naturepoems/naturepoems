When I rise with the sun,
    the first light awakens
   the dew still resting,
and the world holds its breath:
     petals just about to unfold,
        dreams waiting to take flight.

        My body is one with the air,
            vibrating with whispers
          of unvoiced beauty.
Around me, the leaves dance,
   and I understandâ€”
    this is what it means to be whole.


- William Stafford
