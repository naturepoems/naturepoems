Ash Wednesday

I
Because I cannot hope to turn again
Consummation in this life.
My prayers, I cannot hope to turn again.

Breathe with my heart,  
And breathe once more.
Each fleeting breath the world shook.
Step lightly,  
O beloved,  
For this day is dark and filled with care.

II
And sung in the morning air, like a siren  
Ere we lose hope with nature's endless spring.
This is just one moon exit, down upon the brook.
Life ascends beyond a shrub, beyond the grains of sand.

And all of us know this truth, but by what mark  
Will the day yet come?  
We stand in the sunset with only salt and shadows.  
Where once the world breathed, passion fills us forevermore.  

You may live alive along winter's edge, from pond to path.  
Life feeds upon the day's blast.  
Seeds grow once more on hill and vale, you know.  
There are great inner winds, confessing still.

- TS Eliot
