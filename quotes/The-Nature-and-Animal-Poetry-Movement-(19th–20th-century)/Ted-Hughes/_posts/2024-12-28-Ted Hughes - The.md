The Thought-Fox

    I

    I imagine this fox slipping into my presence,
    A quiet figure with that luminous shadow,
    A clear intellect wrapped in fur. 

    II

    Its black feet, like a thought, come closer,
    Throughout the rest of the stillness,
    The night sky heaves towards the moment
    The fox becomes more than just a vision.

    III

    And soon I hear the faint rustle,
    Sounding like whispers rolling over stone,
    I am not alone in this wilderness, it is murmured,
    But nothing lives and nothing stirs but its paws.

    IV

    At last, it springs alive into my imagination,
    A being stretching outwards to touch my heart,
    And we are both consumed by the fever,
    For even in darkness, I must create.  

    


- Ted Hughes
