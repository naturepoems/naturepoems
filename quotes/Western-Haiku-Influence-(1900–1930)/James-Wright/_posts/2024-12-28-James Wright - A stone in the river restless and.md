Whispers secrets to the flowing waters— 
All is in flux though we feel still, 
On this bank of familiarity, 
I stand listening, felt again, your name."

A stone in the river, restless and free, 
Whispers secrets to the flowing waters— 
All is in flux though we feel still, 
On this bank of familiarity, 
I stand listening, felt again, your name.
