Rain

Softly the clouds embrace the earth,
In whispers, rain descends from high,
A tender kiss, a moment’s birth,
As tear-drops kiss the parched ground dry.

Emerald leaves drink life anew,
Unfurling in the drenching glow,
Nature dons her jeweled hue,
In liquid light, where wildflowers grow.

In puddled streets, reflections gleam,
As shadows pass and laughter wakes,
The world awash in silver dream,
While every drop a secret makes.

Oh, let the rains of springtime fall,
Awake the earth, the soul within,
For in each drop we hear the call,
Of life reborn, of love again.


- Valery Briussov
