Wildflowers

In fields where the wildflowers grow,  
Their colors dance in the sun’s warm glow;  
Like painter’s strokes on canvas vast,  
Every bloom tells a story of summer’s past.  

They sway with grace in the gentle breeze,  
Whispering tales to the wandering bees;  
Their fragrance lingers in the afternoon,  
A symphony played to the soft-spoken tune.  

Each petal a wish, each leaf a dream,  
In the tapestry woven by nature’s seam;  
So let us walk where the wild things roam,  
For in their presence, we find our home.

- E J Brady
