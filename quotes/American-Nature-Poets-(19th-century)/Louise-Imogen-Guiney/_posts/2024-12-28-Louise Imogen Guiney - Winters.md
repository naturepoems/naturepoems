Winter's Breath
Gathered snow, like silver sheen,
Cloaks the earth, so pure, so clean.
Boughs sag under frosted weight,
Nature rests, in tranquil state.
Stars above in crystal light,
Glisten gently through the night,
Whispers echo, dreams that soar,
In winterâ€™s grip, we wait for more.

- Louise Imogen Guiney
