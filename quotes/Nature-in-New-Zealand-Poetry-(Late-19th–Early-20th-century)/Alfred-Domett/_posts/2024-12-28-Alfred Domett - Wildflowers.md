Wildflowers

In the meadow, where nature smiles,
    The wildflowers spread their grace,
With colors bright that stretch for miles,
    In this soft and tender space.
They dance with the wind and sing of the sun,
    A tapestry rich and free,
Each petal and stem tells a story begun,
    In the lap of the earth by the sea.
