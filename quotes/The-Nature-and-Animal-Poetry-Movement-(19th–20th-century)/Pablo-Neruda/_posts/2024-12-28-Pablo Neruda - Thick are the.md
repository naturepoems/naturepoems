Thick are the trunks,
ancient roots of the earth,
dwelling with stories
of each growth phase.
Sculpted whispers,
they wear lichens anew,
cradle the rain,
with ageless truth.
This circle, this loop,
has been drawn in wood,
inked in the air,
an epic density,
that speaks to me
as I walk among you.
In your arms, I find
the continuity,
the sacredness of land,
jewels of the world’s memory.
