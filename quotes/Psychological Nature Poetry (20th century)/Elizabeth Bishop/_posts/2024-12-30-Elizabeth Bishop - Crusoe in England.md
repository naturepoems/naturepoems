Crusoe in England

The wind and the waves,
towns growing in shallow rock,
elms that take their sweet,
eek and eek and not of this world;
weather all over the world,
understand and reach out
like the ultimate measure of stone.
Who is out there again,
as each wave as at long last
can take each one
and put on idle
while he sleeps, still reading
how each salt comes back,
a feather, a hand, a butterfly.
