The Flowers of Evil

Beneath the green ivy,
Sluggish, softened, there apparaint,
Dreamy, delicate language uttered:
Messages wild by earth deferred.

In the shade slow whisperings do pass,
Fragrant as a tender breath,
They trail in dreams the past so sweet,
Nestled in clover at where beds meet.

There, all is only order and beauty,
Luxury, peace, and sensuality.


- Charles Baudelaire
