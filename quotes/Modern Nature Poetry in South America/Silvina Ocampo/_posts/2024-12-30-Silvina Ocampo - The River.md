The River
a white serpent
incision in a dream
of silk and water
only the flies move keeping
thinkers alive.
with rings of storms
and the ebbs of waters,
this sweet idea where I see
it too is one next to another
a house of farms of trees,
a paper bridge across with
that golden charm of the breeze.
Nothing can speak of it,
all is silence by the water
by the sleepy river.
