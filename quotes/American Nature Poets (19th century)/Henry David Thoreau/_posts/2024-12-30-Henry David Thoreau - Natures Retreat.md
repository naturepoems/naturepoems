I walk in the woods,
Together with Nature,
She reveals her wonders,
Every form and creature,
The whispering pines,
The rustle of leaves,
Crickets in night’s chorus,
A lull you believe.

And there when I listen,
I hear the heart beat,
Of this nurturing world,
In the sacred retreat,
Let all hearts awaken,
And no sorrow know;
This land of beauty,
Where life’s rivers flow.

- Henry David Thoreau
