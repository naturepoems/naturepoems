A flock of sheep that grazed along,
The gentlest breeze, its tender song; 
Upon my heart it leaves a mark,
Of each past beauty seldom strong.

The white clouds drifting slow away,
The grass that sweeps in boughs and sighs;
Each comb of mist that shines this day,
Reflects the meaning of our lies.

Yet, as I wander through the green,
I notice shadows playing rings;
The scenes of life are never seen,
Except through what the sunlight brings.

And when the twilight falls on earth,
I turn my thoughts to joys of yore,
To thoughts beyond my simple worth,
Where still, the endless echoes soar.


- William Wordsworth
