The Sky  

In a spent dusk the sky has turned,  
A canvas wrinkled, twisted, tattered;  
Its pale limbs stretch with nothing there  
But pure ache wrapped up in blue —  
Memories woven round softly beneath,  
Weightless as sentences half-spoken.  

And yet each tone tears the sunlight,  
Goes up as far as the stars wander —  
Catching each surface smooth on the water  
Piano unwound and riding in chill,  
The threaded ethics of an empty soul  
Where colours come and sink;  
And through this stillness I learn the need  
To breathe and smile  
For it holds my heart at ease.

- Louis MacNeice
