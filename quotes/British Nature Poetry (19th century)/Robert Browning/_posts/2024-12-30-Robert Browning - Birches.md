When I see birches bend to left and right
Across the Treetops, as Brawnâ€™s grasp indicates,
Swaying softly in the breeze.
I imagine the trees are contemplating
Whether to bow to earth, or let go. 
The gentle truth: we all bow in time,
Stripped of pride before the sky.
What lofty heights to choose instead!
Oh, the grace of breaking down!


- Robert Browning
