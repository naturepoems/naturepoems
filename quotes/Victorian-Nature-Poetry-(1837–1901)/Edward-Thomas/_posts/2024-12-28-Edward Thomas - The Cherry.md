The Cherry Trees

I say that every cherry tree
With its pink blossoms all aglow
Is pointed toward that far-off moon,
This yearly madness similar;
I chatter laughter, feeling free
To stake my claim—from lines below
To whispers in the summer breeze  
That scatter softly on white and green.

Look up, sweet cherry trees so rich  
In perfume's folds to catch the eye;
What time has wrought we can bequeath  
And travel through the day to find.
Time, too, carried we. The wind is swift
As bearers drift. A sigh will rise.

— Edward Thomas
