The Windows

Lord, how can man preach unless he first be  
The gospel he would teach?  
What light is left of fallen man?  
With whose nature, though dark, 
Let eyes anointed, soaked in love,  
Speak of the law with gracious heart,  
A lower part of man raised rather then to die—  
This portrait painted bears,  
The right sensation that retires  
And yet receives the sun's bright beams,  
That reflects heaven's nature,  
To leave for hurt or pain or blame,  
But calls itself restored again.  
O lovely art!  
Lift up the eye,  
And homeward turns my heart  
And ye who’s hearts obey  
Much less than thine!  
Sing it x10—
Man lives and breathes, alive.



- George Herbert
