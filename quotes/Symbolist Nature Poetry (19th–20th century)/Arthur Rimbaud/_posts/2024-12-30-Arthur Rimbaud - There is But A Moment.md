There is but a moment, a moment divine,
Where grasses play in an ancient line,
Underneath the sky, blown by the breeze,
Soft shadows flicker through mellow trees.
All of life’s whispers carry the song,
Slowly through moments where memories throng,
Capture me dear, with a gaze so green,
Wherever I wander, lovely and unseen.

- Arthur Rimbaud
