This is my letter to the World  
That never wrote to Me –  
The simple News that Nature told –  
With tender majesty  

Her message is committed  
To Hands I cannot see –  
For Love of Her – Sweet Countrymen  
Judge tenderly – of Me  

Her Poets shall not be Pfforced –  
To prove their wings – must rise  
Yet guilty once – they show –  
They shall be slow and wise!

- Emily Dickinson
