In the heart of the forest,
Where the ancient trees whisper,
And sunlight dances on leaves,
Nature sings a soft lullaby,
Welcoming all who wander here.

The brook babbles sweet secrets,
As it winds through the emerald glades,
A symphony of rustling roots,
And the breeze carries tales of yore,
In the cradle of life’s embrace.
