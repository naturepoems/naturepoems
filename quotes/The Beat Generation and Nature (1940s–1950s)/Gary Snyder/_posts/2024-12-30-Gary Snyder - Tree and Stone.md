Tree and Stone
A tree stands, rooted deep,
knowing the earth's pulse,
it sways out in the wind!
It stirs with the inner life
that surrounds,
whispering to each stone,
I am alive!

A stone rests on its ancient bed,
still within its composed mass,
yet every moment holds
light captured through time,
touched by the winds of seasons,
dancing life from a thousand years
of silence.

— Gary Snyder
