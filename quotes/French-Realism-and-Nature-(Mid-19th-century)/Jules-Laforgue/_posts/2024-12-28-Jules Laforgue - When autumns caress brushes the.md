When autumn’s caress brushes the ground,  
The leaves, like empires, dissolve into dust,  
Each one a tale of ages past.  
They swirl in a ballet of decay,  
Whispering secrets through the crisp air,  
Under the fading shades of twilight.  
Yet in their fall, there is rebirth,  
For in every ending lies a heart’s new hope,  
And the cycle sways with a tender pulse,  
A promise held in the whispers of the wind.

- Jules Laforgue
