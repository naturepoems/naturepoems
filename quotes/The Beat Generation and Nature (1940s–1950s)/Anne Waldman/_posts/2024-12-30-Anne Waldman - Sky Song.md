Sky Song
the sky is stretched in cobalt,
a vast reality broken over mountains,
a day carved by dappled clouds, 
footprints of sun tracing the curve of flow,
here is stillness, here is wind,
every breath in the atmosphere,
a hum, not just silence,
thunder hangs over the gold fields,
young blades of grass waving goodbye.

listen—every voice consents,
there are echoes of leaves, memories gathered,
and the landscapes alive,
of rhythm and pulse,
everything connected, 
more than flesh, 
more than the tiny instance of water.

Anne Waldman
