The Conqueror

Around the setting sun the firmament grows,  
Veiling thy beauty, darkened with leaden woes;  
For lo! the day dissolves to th’ weary resolution,  
And the depths squander death’s very pollution.  

How lowly bows the sod beneath  
The great gluttony of the eye found death  
When the shadow of spirit is felt so near,  
As peace is locked down with the best of fear.  

As loud night-warblers renew the lament,  
The cypress trees pall thrice; this sad descent  
Shall witness the spirit in garish remorse  
Like trembling jewels that bleach it of course.  

So wilt thou weep for the delicate pain  
Of men who wrought great in shouldered disdain?  
For all know bliss forever is nigh,  
But wait as the laden hearts weigh up the sky.  

And the name of yearning is made swift  
To void the fears in this dusky shift,  
And pinch in bliss that sins with fangs  
When the waves shrink down and the light hangs.  

Have I not leaned thine arm almost a dream?  
In truth as the long hours flow thus a rare stream;  
O! set free the hush on space divine,  
And let me forget while resting here in thine.

- William Cullen Bryant
