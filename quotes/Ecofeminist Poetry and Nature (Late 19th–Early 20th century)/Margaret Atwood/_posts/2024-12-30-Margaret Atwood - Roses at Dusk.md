Roses at dusk make
A sky of the deepest blue,
As shadows deepen,
I walk the path homeward,
Where petals unfurl like
Thoughts of past, tied
To roots, stretching out
Into the earth and beyond.
They are what remembers,
In the quiet of night,
Dew resting lightly
On the edge of experience.
Ah, life flows in the water!
Life’s ungraspable
Roots intertwine—
With the breath of wind, 
It sings a song from every
Bloom touched; they follow me,  
The wanderers of dusk.

- Margaret Atwood
