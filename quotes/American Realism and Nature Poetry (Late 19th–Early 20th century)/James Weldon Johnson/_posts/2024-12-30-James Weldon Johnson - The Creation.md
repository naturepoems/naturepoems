The Creation

And God stepped out on space,  
   And looked around and said,  
   I’m lonely—  
I’ll make me a world.

   And as  
   The world was rolling on  
The air was thick  
And joyful music began to play,  
   As God stepped out on space,  
   And spoke the word.


   And that’s how  
   The world was created,  
   And from the void came  
   The waters and the sky.

   And now  
   I walk in the breeze,  
   Hear the whispering trees,  
   And feel life’s gentle stir,  
   For I was there,  
   When God made the world.
