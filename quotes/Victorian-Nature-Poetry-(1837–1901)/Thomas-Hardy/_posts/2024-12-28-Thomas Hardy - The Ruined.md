The Ruined Maid
'O Melia, my dear, this
Is a magnificent way.
The delvings of yore did seem quite listless, 
With barely horizontal ray.

The dairy is firm, the clover grows fine;
Finest of sheens dear yellow;
Sun-cups, the seeds which turn half divine.
Meet thy love in the sweet gifts of letter—

That steadfast notice betwixt us two
Shall mean less in century hour.
O Melia, dear, have you known
What it is when fate has power?

- Thomas Hardy
