The Forest

In the gold of the dusk, ethereal,
The crimson fire of the evening sky;
Emerging, the trees cast long shadows,
Their trunks, like strong arms in prayer, rise high.

Windswept leaves in a rustle whisper,
Rustling content in the warm lullaby.
Scent of pine, where the scent is sweet,
In the cloak of twilight, life holds her sighs.

The silence here is a profound mystery,
A calm embraces every hidden shade;
Yet in the entwined roots, a darkness sleeps,
Where the whispers settle deep in the glade.

- Alexandre Blok
