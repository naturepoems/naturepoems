On the Shore

Beside the tranquil waves of foam,
I watched the sun descend to rest,
The gulls danced to the ocean's song,
As though the sky had woven dreams, 
A tapestry of brilliance, rich in color—
Yet within my heart a shadow loomed,
For every beauty whispered loss,
In the soft embrace of silver sands.
