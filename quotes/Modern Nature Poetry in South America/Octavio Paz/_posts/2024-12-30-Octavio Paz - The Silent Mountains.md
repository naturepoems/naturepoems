Mountains stand, proud,
aching with ancient strength,
yet tender in their moss,
soft voices in the breeze;
under their watchful gaze,
a cacophony of life unfolds.

Birds call in the distance
as day meets twilight,
a serenade of nature,
a reminder of our place,
humbly grand yet fleeting.

- Octavio Paz
