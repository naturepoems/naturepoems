The Rain

The rain falls on the thirsty ground, 
In drops of diamonds, gleaming found; 
Each droplet tells a tale of care— 
That Nature sheds on all laid bare. 

Oh soft, sweet rain, that knits the gloom— 
In each fresh drop, new life will bloom; 
You kiss the soil, you wake the seed— 
A fleeting moment is all we heed. 

With every shower, the world awakes, 
From ancient dreams the spirit shakes; 
The air is filled with scents divine— 
Of vivid bloom, you twist and twine. 

So fall, my rain, and cleanse my soul, 
With every drop, I feel made whole; 
For in your grace, I see the light— 
The beauty born from every night.

- George William Curtis
