Echoes of Nature

In the twilight hush, where the echoes fade,
The world still breathes in shadows cast warm,
Each whisper of wind, a serenade,
Holding hearts in a gentle, timeless charm.

Each leaf unfurls under the night sky,
Bathed in the glow of the silver moon,
The secrets of dusk trickle softly by,
Carried away in a lonesome tune.

The crickets’ song fills the cool night air,
A harmony threaded through branches and bough,
In nature’s embrace, there is wonder rare,
In this film of existence, we take a bow.

As the stars shed light on the shadowed glen,
And under their gaze, we all belong,
We find our solace and seek beyond pen,
In the echoes of nature, the earth’s sweet song.

- Katherine Mansfield
