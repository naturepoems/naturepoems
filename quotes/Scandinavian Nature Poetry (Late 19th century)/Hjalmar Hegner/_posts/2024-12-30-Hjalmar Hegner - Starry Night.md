Beneath the starry, velvet night,  
The world transforms in cosmic glow,  
Each flicker holds a wish, a light,  
That dances softly on the snow.

I walk amidst the tranquil air,  
With every step, the earth I feel,  
In this vast space, my heart laid bare,  
In silence, natureâ€™s place to heal.

- Hjalmar Hegner
