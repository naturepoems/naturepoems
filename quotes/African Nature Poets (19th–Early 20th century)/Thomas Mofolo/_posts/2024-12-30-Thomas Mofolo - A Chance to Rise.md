With every dawn, a chance to rise,  
To witness the magic in the skies,  
Nature awakens in a glorious dance,  
A tapestry woven, a sacred romance.

The fragrance of earth, fresh and bright,  
A reminder of beauty in morning light,  
As the world spins on, so do I,  
In gratitude for the life that flies.

- Thomas Mofolo
