O Lord, the world is filled with flowers:
You know the ways and whence they bloom;
Through all our days and all our hours,
Let me abide within Thy room.

Though flowers fade, the promise lingers,
Your fragrant love shall still remain;
In quiet nights and solemn singers,
By every stream, let me rejoice in thy rain!

- Joyce Kilmer
