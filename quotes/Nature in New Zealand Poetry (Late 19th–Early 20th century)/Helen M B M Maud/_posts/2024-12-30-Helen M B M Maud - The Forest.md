The Forest

In emerald shade, the forest dwells,
A sanctuary of the meek,
Where silence speaks, where nature swells,
In every bough, the whispers seek.

The ancient trees, with arms outspread,
In majesty, they stand and sway;
Their roots like fingers, dreams widespread,
In mossy beds where softens play.

So take a step, embrace the green,
Let nature’s heartbeat echo true;
In every breath, life’s pulse is seen,
A bond of earth, forever new.

- Helen M B M Maud
