---

The oceans stretch, both fierce and calm,
Their whispers weave an ancient psalm,
With tides that pull, a rhythmic dance,
In salty air, I find my chance.

To stand alone upon the shore,
And feel the pulse of life once more,
Each wave a story, each crash a sigh,
In natureâ€™s arms, I learn to fly.
