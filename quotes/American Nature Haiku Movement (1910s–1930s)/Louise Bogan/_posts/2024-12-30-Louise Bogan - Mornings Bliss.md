The dawn breaks soft and gentle—  
A tender caress of light,
Kissing the earth awake.
Birds sing their morning chorus,
And life stirs in the quiet,
As day unfolds its arms.

In the garden's embrace,
Petals open—
Revealing colors bright,
A celebration of rebirth,
And the joy of being alive.


- Louise Bogan
