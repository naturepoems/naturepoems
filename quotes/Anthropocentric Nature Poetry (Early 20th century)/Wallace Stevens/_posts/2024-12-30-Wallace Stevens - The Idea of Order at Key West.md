The Idea of Order at Key West

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed of itself alone;
The sea was made of her. She was the maker.

The song was hers; in it, she spoke to the sea.
The sea did not exist until she sang,
And the sea made of her a being of her own.

The words were surplus, for they could not tell
Of a world where nature met the voice.

If it was not for the song, there would be no world,
And the world she made was a world of her own.
