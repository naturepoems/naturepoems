The Wind

O, restless Wind that roams the night,
Through trees that sigh and bow and bend,
You bring a whispered secret light,
A promise heard from end to end.

You carry scent of pine and earth,
And stir the sea to wild delight,
Each gust ignites a spiritâ€™s birth,
Reviving dreams within its flight.

In harmony with every tone,
Your sigh caresses all you greet,
In every heart, we are not alone,
For there your melody we meet.


- Mary Elizabeth Coleridge
