The ocean stretches,
each wave a verse, a poem
of movement and rhythm,
each splash a celebration
of existence.

I stand at the edge,
where sand meets sea,
a liminal space,
where I feel the heartbeat
of the earth, alive and wild,
a reminder of love
that flows unceasing,
forever patient, forever kind.

In salt and foam,
I uncover my soul,
and the whispers
of the sea speak to me,
a promise to return,
to find joy in the tides.


- Alice Walker
