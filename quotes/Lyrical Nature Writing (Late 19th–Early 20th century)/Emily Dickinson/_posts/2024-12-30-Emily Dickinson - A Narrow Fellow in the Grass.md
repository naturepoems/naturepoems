A Narrow Fellow in the Grass  
Occasionally rides—  
You may have met Him—did you not  
His notice sudden is—  

The Grass divides as with a Comb,  
A spotted Snake skims swiftly by—  
The Grass divides as with a Comb,  
But never trained a foot.  

And in the grass I hardly see  
The fear he leaves behind—  
Leads on to me—  
While I am stung by feelings fine  
And miss the stops—I cannot see.  

The Grass indeed is not a thing  
A fellow's eye can view—  
Unless it passes softly by,  
And leaves him skin-deep bruised—  


- Emily Dickinson
