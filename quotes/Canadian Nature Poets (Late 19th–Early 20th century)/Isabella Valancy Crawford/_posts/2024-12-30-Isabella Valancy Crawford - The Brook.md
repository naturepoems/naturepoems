The Brook

Winding, ever winding,
  Through the greenwood glade,
The soft light falls, and finding
  A place it makes the shade,
As the brook, a merry creature,
  Trills its happy song,
And the trees, in gentle feature,
  To its cadence throng.

Round the rocky mossy coast,
  Watching each curve and curl,
It shines, a liquid ghost,
  A silver crystal whirl!

How it tumbles and avoids,
  Yet never quite escape;
All the shadows it employs,
  In a merry escaping shape.

- Isabella Valancy Crawford
