Ah, the river that laughs and dances,  
It weaves lifeâ€™s tapestry with silver threads.  
How it glimmers, reflecting the universe,  
In its flowing water, dreams unfurl.  
On its banks, wildflowers flourish,  
In a kaleidoscope of serenity,  
Each petal a prayer to the endless skies,  
As the sun dips low, steeped in gold,  
And the rush of water lulls my heart;  
At twilight's close, the world whispers love.

- Jules Laforgue
