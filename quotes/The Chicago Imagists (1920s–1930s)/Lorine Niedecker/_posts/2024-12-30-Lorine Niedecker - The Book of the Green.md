The Book of the Green

The sun is again in the green,
   a book on the grass.
The open page,
   I can't read.

Hot breaths on noon,
   cloud shadows slip away,
A squirrel moves in the sweet dew —
     I'm patient as a tree.

In the whispers of willows,
   the sound of paper,
crumpling like a voice,
   bending like the embrace of leaves.

There is no voice to echo my name,
  with only the wind,
who is warbling it, and playing it on—a
    scribe of the earth.

- Lorine Niedecker
