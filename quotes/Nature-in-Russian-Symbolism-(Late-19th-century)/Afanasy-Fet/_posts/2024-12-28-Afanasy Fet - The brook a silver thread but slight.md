The brook, a silver thread but slight,  
In whispers tells of distant shore,  
Where evening casts her dreamy light,  
And shadows rest forevermore.  

The rustling leaves begin to sway,  
And listen to the hymns of dusk,  
While twilight melts the light of day  
And wraps the world in stillness husk.
