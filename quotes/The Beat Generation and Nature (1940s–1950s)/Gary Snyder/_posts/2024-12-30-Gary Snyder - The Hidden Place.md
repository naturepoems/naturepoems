The Hidden Place
Beneath the leaf,
under the wet soil,
there is life insistent,
cupped in the dark
of the hidden place
where time breathes vastly
and unseen roots reach out,
intertwining in the silence.

Rain whispers, and the crickets call,
songs of things that dwell
in the past, and death spills
into rich new life, green
growing over the stones.

— Gary Snyder
