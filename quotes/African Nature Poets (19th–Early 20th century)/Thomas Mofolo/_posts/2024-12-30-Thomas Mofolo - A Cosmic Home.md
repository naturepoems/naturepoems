Beneath the stars, where the wild things roam,  
The universe whispers of a cosmic home,  
In the rustle of leaves, I hear the call,  
Of the great cycle of life, embracing all.

The night unveils the hidden grace,  
Of creatures that move without a trace,  
And in the silence, a truth unfolds,  
In nature's arms, our stories are told.

- Thomas Mofolo
