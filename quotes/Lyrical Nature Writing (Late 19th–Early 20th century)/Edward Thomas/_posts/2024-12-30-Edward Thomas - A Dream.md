A Dream

In dreams I walk by streams that flow,
In whispers of the moonlit night,
Where shadows flicker, soft and slow,
And stars converse in soft delight.

Each breath I take is filled with light,
A balm for these seeking thoughts,
With nature's heart, my soul takes flight,
And in this realm, all pain is naught.


- Edward Thomas
