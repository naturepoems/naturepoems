A Farewell
The golden light of day declines,
   And life, now slipped, must end;
Within the waves of time’s designs,
   A pulse, I cannot mend.

For in the green of gleaming woods,
   When sorrow shakes the trees,
In gentle calm, from hollow floods,
   I choose, ‘bove all, such keys.

Within each flower, each verdant bough,
   A touch of memory glows;
And though the light of morn is now,
   I feel it as I go.

With every step, I fondly feel
   This beauty fade away;
In essence made of wood and seal,
   I dwell in twilight’s play.

o earth, from candle made of stars,
   Who celebrates the day!
With tender songs through years and wars,
   In freedom shall we stay.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
