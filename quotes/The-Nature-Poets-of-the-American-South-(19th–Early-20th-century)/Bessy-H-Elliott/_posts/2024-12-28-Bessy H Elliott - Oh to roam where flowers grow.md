Oh! to roam where flowers grow,  
Beneath the trees, where rivers flow;  
To walk through woods with paths untried,  
With nature as my honored guide.  
Her gentle touch on every hand,  
Her calm embrace, a soft command;  
In every sound, a melody  
Of earth's sweet harmony with me.

- Bessy H Elliott
