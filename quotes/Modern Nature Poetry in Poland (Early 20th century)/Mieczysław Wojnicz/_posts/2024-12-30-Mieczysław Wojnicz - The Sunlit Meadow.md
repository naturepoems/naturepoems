The Sunlit Meadow
In meadows bright where lilies sway,
The sun spills gold through fields of hay,
Butterflies flit, a vibrant hue,
In nature’s palette, the heart renews.

The laughter of the children’s play,
Echoes through the blooms each day,
A moment caught, a timeless treasure,
In sweet simplicity, we find our measure.

- Mieczysław Wojnicz
