On the brink of the lake, where the waters lie still,  
reflections of dreams blend with shadows at will.  
A canvas of colors, where the sky meets the shore,  
each ripple a whisper, nature’s own lore.

The cool breeze carries, sweet scents of the pine,  
as the sun doth descend, painting evening’s design.  
In this moment of peace, when the world feels right,  
I find solace in nature, under fading light.

- Émile Zola
