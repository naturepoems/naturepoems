The Sea

Full of beauty, power, and strength
None but the wildest heart feels pain;
Its waves have gathered tenderness’s mirth
Once, wracked, and many times again.

And in its depths pour forth the voice
Of spirits bending round in delight,
The ceaseless lark, the tree at hand  
All speak to me, in friendship's stance.

The sky above, is so wondrous calm;
Its billows glimmer, break, and fold;
And earth applauds the siren’s song,
Flowing softly, grief, despair are but awaiting,

- Lord Byron
