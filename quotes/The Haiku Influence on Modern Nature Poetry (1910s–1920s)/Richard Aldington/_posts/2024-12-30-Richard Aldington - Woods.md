Through the tangled woods I roam,
Where shadows stretch and whisper low,
Among the wildflowers’ sweet perfume,
And hearts rest easy with their dreams.

In each nook, the sunlight plays,
Creating tapestries of glow,
And in these spaces vast and free,
I learn the language of the leaves,
And heed the symphony of the wild.

- Richard Aldington
