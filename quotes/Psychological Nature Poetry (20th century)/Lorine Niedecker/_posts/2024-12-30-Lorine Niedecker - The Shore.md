The shadow deepens above the beach,
What wild currents make that platform loose,
In the grassâ€”the sea,
Gathering, forming feeling,
Every crest arises,
Like whispers of the unborn,
Empires of vast calm.
Mists float low, serene-touched sky,
As mist turns to quiet
On borrowed feathers of time.
To exit can never be a choice,
Transformations proof the flame, profound.
We embrace all we cradle,
The stones still warm high underfoot.

- Lorine Niedecker
