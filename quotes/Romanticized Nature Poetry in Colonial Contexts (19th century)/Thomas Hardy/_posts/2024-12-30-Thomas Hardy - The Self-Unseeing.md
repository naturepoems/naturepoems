The Self-Unseeing

The evening glance strikes somewhere still,
On elixirs that were true,
While scents divine, the thrushes spill
A magicâ€™s mood or dew.

Yet I stood beneath a story oak,
Arrayed in lifeless care;
The darkened forebill folded stole,
Adrift, too gray was air.

For what in art is half a tryst
With a woman who last spun,
With trees blown past and behind mist,
That say the roses won?

- Thomas Hardy
