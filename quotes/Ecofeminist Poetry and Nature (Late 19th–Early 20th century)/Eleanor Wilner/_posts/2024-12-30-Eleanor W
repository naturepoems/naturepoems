The moonlit path  
always beckons to all who wander,
who get lost among leafy archives,
cascading voices of the night;
yes, let the world sing,
let it thrum through the veins,   
let us receive what calls  
to that vast expanse,
to that wildering profile,
all along the journey,
where dreams take flight
with freedom among tendrils,
untethered from tomorrow’s weight  
with scents of evergreens,
of earth—in beauty.
