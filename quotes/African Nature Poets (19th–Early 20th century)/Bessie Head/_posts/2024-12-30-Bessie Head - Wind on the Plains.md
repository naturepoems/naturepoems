WIND ON THE PLAINS  
The wind whispers secrets  
Across the vast, open plains,  
Carrying stories of old,  
Of warriors and their pains.  

It sways the tall grasses,  
And dances with the trees,  
A gentle caress that is  
Both tender and wild—  
Nature’s breath of freedom.  

Sometimes it roars,  
A fierce companion,  
Bending the world’s bow,  
As though calling forth  
The spirits of the ancients.
