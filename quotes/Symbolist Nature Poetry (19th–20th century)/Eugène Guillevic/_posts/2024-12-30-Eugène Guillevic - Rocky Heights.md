Upon rocky heights, where
   the frosted sun kisses,
  the laughter of winds spins,
   and the world unravels.
 
Horizon drapes like a scarf,
   wrapping the earth in vibrancy,
   spreading bright like echoes,
   in every crevice and stream.

Here lies joy, woven
   through blades of quicksilver,
   as clouds release their shadows
   to dance upon valleys,
   leading us toward eternity.

With each beat of day,
   we find the pulse of existence,
   held in a mirror of mountains,
   where time is silken,
   and every moment
   a treasure trove of life.
   
Rejoice as we wander,
   beneath the vast,
   entwined within the vastness of sky.

- Eugène Guillevic
