Summer
without it first.
So that darkness as it lifts,
answers tender and limber-born
enfolding your homeward arc.
Thine are the ripened fields of gold,
gleaming-
where thrushes plunge like flutes
at dusk — and the light behind pulses
unfurling moon-rats in thick lanes,
streaming along dusky sides,
creek beds of evening-dew,
you must pace through with me,
flower-loosed, deeply drunk.
Where wingless the air is shy, a-gather within us.
We shall drown softly, unargued
by nature’s rapid silk, drifting ever-onward.


- Mina Loy
