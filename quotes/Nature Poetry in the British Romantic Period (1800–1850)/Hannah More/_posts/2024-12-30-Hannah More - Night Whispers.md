The gentle whisper of the stream,
As daylight fades to evening's dream,
Calls forth the stars to twinkle bright,
And fills the world with soft delight.

The moon looks down with silver sheen,
Upon the landscape, calm and clean;
The shadows dance, the crickets sing,
And peace descends on everything.

Oh, let us wander in this night,
With hearts so open to the light;
For in these woods, beneath the sky,
The spirit soars, the soul flits by.

- Hannah More
