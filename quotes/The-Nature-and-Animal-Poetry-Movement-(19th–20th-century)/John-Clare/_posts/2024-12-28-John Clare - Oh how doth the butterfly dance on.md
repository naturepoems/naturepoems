Oh, how doth the butterfly dance on air,
In wings of silver, like dreams laid bare,
Each flutter a story, each rise a flight,
A fleeting moment of heavenly light.

In meadows of gold, where daisies grow,
Her gossamer trails the soft winds blow.
With delicate grace, she kisses the blooms,
A creature of wonder that never looms.

The whispering grass feels her elation,
As she flits through each flowering creation.
Come, let me linger where beauty flies,
And find in her flight, my heart’s sweet ties.
— John Clare
