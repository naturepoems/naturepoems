As twilight falls, the world does sigh,
The sun bows low, the stars comply,
Each twinkle tells of a night well spent,
In natureâ€™s lap, all worries relent.

The crickets chirp a lullaby,
While fireflies flicker in the shy,
In this hushed night, all fears do cease,
Embraced by dark, I find my peace.
