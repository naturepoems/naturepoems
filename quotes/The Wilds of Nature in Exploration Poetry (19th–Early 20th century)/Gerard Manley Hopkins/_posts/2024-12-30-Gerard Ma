Autumn’s Whisper

The leaves fall softly, a gentle sigh,
   In colors rich, they carpet the ground,
   A tapestry of gold beneath the sky,
   Nature whispers, a soft, sweet sound.

In fading light, the days grow brief,
   Yet, there’s beauty in this change of scene,
   As trees stand bare, a quiet grief,
   The winds carry tales of what has been.

But still, there’s a warmth, a lingering glow,
   In every sunset, a promise to keep,
   As autumn sings her soft, sweet woe,
   And lulls the earth in a tranquil sleep.

O Autumn, your whispers I hear,
   A song of closure, a gentle rest,
   In your embrace, I hold you dear,
   For in your end, there lies the best.


- Gerard Manley Hopkins
