When rivers weave tales through valleys so deep,
And mountains stand guard like eternal wards,
The beauty of nature is one we shall keep,
In our hearts, as a reverent accord.

With skies that ignite with the sun's warm embrace,
Every moment is painted with wonder anew.
In this vast expanse, we find our own place,
As nature invites us to start our own view.

- Anna Brigadere
