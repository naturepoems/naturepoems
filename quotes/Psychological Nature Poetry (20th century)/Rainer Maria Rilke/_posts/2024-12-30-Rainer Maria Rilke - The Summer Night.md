The Summer Night

The stars wake with the moon,
And the night is a dark embrace,
The air thick with fragrances,
Of jasmine and lilac sweetening time,

Where all is a hushed invitation—
To listen to the nightingales' serenade.
And deep in the heart of the stillness,
Nature hums a lullaby unnoticed.

Hushed now, I wander along the pathways,
My heart open to each shadowed form,
For in the summer’s gentle cover,
Life’s mysteries unfold slowly, softly.

In every heartbeat, there is beauty; 
I catch the scent of union,
As the veins of the evening pulse,
Against the quiet fabric of night; 
Where every star is a note of bliss.

I feel the essence of being—
Cradles of time, wrapped within darkness,
Bathe me whole in luminous bliss.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
