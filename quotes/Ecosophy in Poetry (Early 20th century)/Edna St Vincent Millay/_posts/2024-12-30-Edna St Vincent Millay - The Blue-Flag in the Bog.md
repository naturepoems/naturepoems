The Blue-Flag in the Bog  
  ------------------------  
The blue-flag in the bog has found  
  A way to lift  
A long-stemmed leaf above the mire,  
And it has stood  
A high-brimmed cup,  
  To hold the overflow,  
The tops of the wild grasses,  
  The embroidered leaves,  
It is a sunbeam stray again,  
A wild swan's wingâ€”  
  Can its beauty be taken from me,  
  The sweet scent of the blue-flower,  
In this beautiful deep?  


- Edna St Vincent Millay
