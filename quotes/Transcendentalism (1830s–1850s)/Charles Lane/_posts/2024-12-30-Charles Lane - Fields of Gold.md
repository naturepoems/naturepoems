Fields of gold beneath the sun,
Where time and nature become one,
Each stalk a story, waiting long,
In silence wrapped, they sing a song.

With gentle hands, the farmers toil,
To turn the earth, to bless the soil,
In every seed lies hope and grace,
In nature’s bounty, we find our place.

- Charles Lane
