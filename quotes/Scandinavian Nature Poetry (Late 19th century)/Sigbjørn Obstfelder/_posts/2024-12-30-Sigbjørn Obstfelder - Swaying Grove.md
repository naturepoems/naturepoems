Beneath the canopy of a swaying grove,
Where sunlight dapples and shadows play,
I find solace in the whispering leaves,
In the songs of the wild, I long to stay.

Each petal a story, each branch a song,
In the heart of the forest, I feel so alive;
Nature sings in harmony, a timeless refrain,
In its loving embrace, I forever thrive.

- Sigbjørn Obstfelder
