The thicket deep, where wildflowers weave their art,
In fragrant tapestries of gold and green,
The gentle sigh of nature, close to heart,
A hidden realm that time has seldom seen.

The dances of the butterflies, so light,
Flit through the branches, weaving through the air,
As sunlight spills its honey in the night,
A spell is cast, beneath the willow’s stare.

And in this woodland, solitude’s embrace,
Wraps daydreams in its leafy cryptic sighs;
With each soft rustle, nature finds her place,
In perfect balance, life both breathes and flies.

- John Clare
