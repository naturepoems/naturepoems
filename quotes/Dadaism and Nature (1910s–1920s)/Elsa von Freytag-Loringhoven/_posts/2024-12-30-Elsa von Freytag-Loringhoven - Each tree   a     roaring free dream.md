Each tree,
   a 
    roaring free dream,
      slivered
       with sky.
       Muscles of moss
   pinching unison,
    oh, nectar! We dance!
       The wild wine flows,
   from a petal's deep mouth,
   to hold the forest's laughter --
   demon of roots,
   ghost of chairs.
   Out of thorns,
   come roses like
   trumpets that trace the weather.

- Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven
