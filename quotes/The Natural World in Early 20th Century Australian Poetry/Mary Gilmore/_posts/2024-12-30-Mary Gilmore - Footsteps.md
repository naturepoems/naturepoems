Footsteps

With every step upon the earth,
  A dance of life’s sweet waltz,
In paths unknown, gives birth to mirth,
  Each footprint softly halts.

For nature shakes her ancient dust,
  In every stride we take;
With every light and shadow thrust,
  New stories we shall make.

So tread with care, for life is grand,
  And every breath divine;
In every brush of nature’s hand,
  A memory we twine.


- Mary Gilmore
