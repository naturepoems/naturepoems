The green lizard crackles against the heat,
Under the chill of the alpenglow,
And pairs of birds will sing until the night,
With shades of twilight dancing slow.

To the meadows we may tarry close,
Before the fury of winds arise:
A fairer spot ‘neath emerald trees,
Where glistens still, above the skies.

- A E Housman
