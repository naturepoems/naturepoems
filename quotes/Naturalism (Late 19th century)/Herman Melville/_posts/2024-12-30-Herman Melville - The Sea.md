The Sea  
   
O mighty ocean! wide and vast,  
Your waves crash high against the shore,  
A ceaseless hymn that long shall last,  
A dance of wild forevermore.  
  
A restless spirit ever roaming,  
Upon your waves, my heart be free,  
With every tide, new life is forming,  
In storm or peace, it calls to me.  
  
And ships that brave your open arms,  
In journeys bold across the foam,  
They carry forth the mariner's charms,  
And in your depths, they find their home.

- Herman Melville
