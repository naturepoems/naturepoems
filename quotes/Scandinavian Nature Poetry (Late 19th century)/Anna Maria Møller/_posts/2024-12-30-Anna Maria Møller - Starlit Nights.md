Starlit Nights

Beneath a blanket of velvet night,
Stars awaken, twinkling bright,
A cosmic dance, the universe wide,
In nature’s cradle, we take pride.

With every glimmer, a story unfolds,
Whispers of the past, secrets told,
In the silence, we hear the call,
Of dreams and hopes that rise and fall.

The moon, a sentinel gleaming fair,
Watches over with gentle care,
In these moments, we discover our way,
In nature's magic, forever stay.


- Anna Maria Møller
