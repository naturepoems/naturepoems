In the hush of dawn, when the world is still,  
And the sky soft blushes with pink and gold;  
A promise awakens on the sleeping hill,  
As nature sings out the stories untold.  

The birds serenade from the branches high,  
Their songs drift like notes on a gentle breeze;  
While the sun peeks over the edge of the sky,  
In the dance of the day, my spirit finds ease.

- Ruth Dallas
