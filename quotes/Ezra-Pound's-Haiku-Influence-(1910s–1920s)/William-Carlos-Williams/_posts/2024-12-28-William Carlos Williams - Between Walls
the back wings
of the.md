quote: "Between Walls
the back wings
of the fly

are covered with red
and as the flower snips

the uttering glow
of crushed weeds—

deep in the paths
between walls,
drum beats—from far,

only a fraction
of which remains."

Between Walls
the back wings
of the fly

are covered with red
and as the flower snips

the uttering glow
of crushed weeds—

deep in the paths
between walls,
drum beats—from far,

only a fraction
of which remains.

- William Carlos Williams
