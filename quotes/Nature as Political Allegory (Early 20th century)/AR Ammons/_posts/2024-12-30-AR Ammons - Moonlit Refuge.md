Underneath the moon’s soft gaze,
establishing shadows over all
that breathes—the pine trees stately,
the ferns whispering in the chill,

I find sanctuary in darkness.
There’s comfort in the night’s embrace—
a slow unfurling, a release,
as stars etch silent stories,
each twinkle inviting thought to wander.
