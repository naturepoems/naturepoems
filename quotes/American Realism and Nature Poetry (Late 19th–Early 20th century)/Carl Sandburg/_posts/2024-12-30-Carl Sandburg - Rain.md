Rain

The rain is a gentle cry,
Bringing hopes upon its folds,
Each drop a whisper from the air,
To greet the waiting earth.
Softness and coolness unfolds my skin,
A cool caress stirring the heart,
Greeting life anew.
Let the thunder speak otherwise,
For the sky promises a brighter day.

Soon the clouds will wander on,
To the next place they can kiss—
Filling lakes and streams,
Bringing life to the roots of trees,
Breathing life, each pulse, its sound,
And the earth will answer to the call.

- Carl Sandburg
