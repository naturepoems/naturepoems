Nature is a patient teacher,
   it says with every sunrise,
   each snow flake that falls,
   the sap that rises in the trees.
   In that desire to connect,
   I find myself reaching out,
   like roots seeking the moist earth.

   Let me be present in these moments,
   watching as the cicadas sing,
   the waving grasses bow in breezes,
   and I, a mere soul,
   find grandeur in the soft strokes
   of a world beyond myself.

   Here I learn to listen,
   cherish with gratitude
   the life that comes from saying yes,
   standing still amid the chaos
   and embracing the wisdom
   of harmony and growth.


- Wendell Berry
