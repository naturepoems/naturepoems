 SUNSET ON THE HILL

Oh how the sunset gilds the distant hill,  
A canvas vast, brushed bright with amber hue;  
The whispers of the breeze are hushed and still,  
As nature holds her breath for this debut.  
With every sunset, dreams of night renew,  
And beckon forth unspoken, soft desire,  
In golden light, the world feels fresh and true,  
As radiant colors fuse and sing like fire.


- Walter Deverell
