The moon at midnight, melting bright,
In a silver mist of air last lingers,
On the meadow, where the night-birds' flight
Beats down from their voices, winding with their fingers.

Their wild notes weave a shadowy lace,
With the stars that glimmer and wane above,
As silence finds, in her magic space,
The thrumming strains of a nocturnal love.

- George Edward Woodberry
