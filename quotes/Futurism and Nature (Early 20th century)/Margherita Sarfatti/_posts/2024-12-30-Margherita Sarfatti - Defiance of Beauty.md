Luminous flowers sway,
a sway of rebellion,
a defiance against entropy,
a soft challenge to time,
as they bloom, they shout,
'Here I am, come to witness!'
Brushstrokes of nature,
a bold mural painted,
you and I suspended,
each laugh, each breath,
once mere whispers in a storm.

- Margherita Sarfatti
