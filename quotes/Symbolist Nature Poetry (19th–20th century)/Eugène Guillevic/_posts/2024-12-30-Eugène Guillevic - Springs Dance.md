When spring unfolds
   her cerulean fabrics,
   every budding limb
    drinks in the essence,
    a timeless offering.
    The fragrance of blossoms
swells like a secret song,
   so the earth writes to the sky.

Against the backdrop
   of a hawthorn’s blush,
   I find the love letters
    of bees,
    in the warm breath of honey,
    in every languid hum.

Old stones collect dew,
    as laughter spills,
    from a brook,
    where the spirits gather,
and the grass kneels in awe.

This, my love,
   is where life dances,
   in the wild embrace of spring.

- Eugène Guillevic
