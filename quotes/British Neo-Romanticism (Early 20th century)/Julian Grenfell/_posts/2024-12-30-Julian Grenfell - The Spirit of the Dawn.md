The Spirit of the Dawn
I love the morning, in that light
The grey things lose their coldness,
And the great sun rolls over the land; 
The autumn leaves and the eagle skies.
I love to see the soaring clouds,
The bluepavilions in which birds cry,
But I must turn â€“ for oh the seasons!
They wake the sighing heart that heaves.
And when the centre of the dawn shall glow,
Oh, the soaring white must mark my soul!



- Julian Grenfell
