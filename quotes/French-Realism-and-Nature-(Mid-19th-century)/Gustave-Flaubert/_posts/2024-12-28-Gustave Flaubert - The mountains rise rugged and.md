The mountains rise, rugged and steep,
Their peaks a testament to natureâ€™s might,
Beneath their shadows, valleys slumber,
Bathed in soft, silvery moonlight.

Pines stand tall, sentinels of time,
Clad in cloaks of evergreen hue,
Guarding the earth with ancient wisdom,
A symphony of life, ever new.

- Gustave Flaubert
