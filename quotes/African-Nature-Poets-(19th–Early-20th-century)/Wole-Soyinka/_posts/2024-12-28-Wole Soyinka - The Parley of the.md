The Parley of the Stars
High above, the stars convene,
In a silent pact, so pristine,
With the moon as their sovereign judge,
In cosmic flow, they never budge.

O, the meeting of light and dark,
In the folds of night, there starts a spark,
Of stories etched in cosmic dust,
Crafted in starlight, forged in trust.

As I gaze up, I seek to find,
The whispers of dreams that fate entwined,
In the tender night, in soft embrace,
We become lovers of the boundless space.

- Wole Soyinka
