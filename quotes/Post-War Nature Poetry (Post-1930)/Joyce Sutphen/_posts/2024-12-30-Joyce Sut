The river flows, an unending song,
a melody stitched in the fabric of time,
each ripple a note, each bend a chorus,
a journey winding beyond the horizon.

Along its banks, life teems,
a chorus of voices rising with the water,
a blend of laughter, whispers, and sighs,
each presence a reflection in the current.

The trees bow gracefully,
their roots drinking deeply from the life,
a dance with the river, a symbiosis,
a reminder that we are all tethered.

And here, in the flow,
I find my own rhythm, my breath entwined
with the pulse of nature’s heart,
a connection that transcends mere existence.

To walk alongside this liquid path,
a pilgrimage of the spirit,
each moment a testament to the beauty
of life’s intricate, weaving tapestry.


- Joyce Sutphen
