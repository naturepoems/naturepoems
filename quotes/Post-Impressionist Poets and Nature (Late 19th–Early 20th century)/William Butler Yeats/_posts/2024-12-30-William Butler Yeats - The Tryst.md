The Tryst

I have come to the sacred place,
Where your heart whispers by the grove,
Along the stream where lilies sway,
And in love’s magic, we shall move.

You are a week of wild blooms,
And the earth beneath me, deep and whole,
In every arching whim of time,
I hold your laughter in my soul.

- William Butler Yeats
