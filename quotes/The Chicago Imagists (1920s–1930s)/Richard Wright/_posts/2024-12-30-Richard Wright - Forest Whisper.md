In the heart of the forest,
Where the air is thick with mystery,
I hear the voices of the trees,
Each trunk a saga of time,
Their roots tangling beneath me.

The dappled sunlight dances,
Creating patterns on the ground,
A tapestry woven by nature’s hand,
And I am but a wandering spirit,
Searching for the secrets within.

Here life is unhurried,
The silence profound,
With each breath I take,
I am part of this ancient song,
A note in the chorus of the wild.

- Richard Wright
