The Dandelion
oh dandelion,
king of weeds,
yellow crowns carrying

once a glory, 
fluff in the air,
blown away like wishes.
all the wrong or right ways to grow,
from sidewalk cracks and garden beds.

miracle child
you cast and scatter,
making lost dreams seed again.
what is your secret?

you break the silence first 
in the morning, and everywhere
among traffic,
while I sit here sketching

life’s wild insistence, 
the dare of you,
courageous and soft between fingers.

Anne Waldman
