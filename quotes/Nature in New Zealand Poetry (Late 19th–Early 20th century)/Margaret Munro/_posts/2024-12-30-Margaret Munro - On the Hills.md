On the Hills

Where the hills embrace the sky,  
And earth meets heaven's sigh,  
I wandered through the fragrant air,  
In peace, amidst beauty rare.

The wildflowers in colors bright,  
Blooming fields, a pure delight,  
While birds sang soft, their melodies,  
In harmony with swaying trees.

The rolling hills, so bold, so free,  
A tapestry of verdancy,  
Each step a journey, each breath a song,  
In nature's arms, where I belong.

- Margaret Munro
