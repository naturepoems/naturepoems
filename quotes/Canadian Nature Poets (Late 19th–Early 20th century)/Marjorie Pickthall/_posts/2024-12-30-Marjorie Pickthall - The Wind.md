The Wind

The wind that stirs the sleeping trees,
A restless spirit gliding high,
It dances through the leaves with ease,
And carries whispers to the sky.

With every gust, a story told,
Of journeys made, of dreams upheld;
In nature's breath, the brave, the bold,
A symphony in silence swelled.

- Marjorie Pickthall
