To Nature
O Nature, swallowing paths of wood  
In every star that lights the way,  
For in your heart is all the good  
That leaves no footprints of decay.
 
The sylvan paths go winding round  
With every mossy memory  
And winds that whisper, soft, profound  
With breath of music wild and free.

- John Clare
