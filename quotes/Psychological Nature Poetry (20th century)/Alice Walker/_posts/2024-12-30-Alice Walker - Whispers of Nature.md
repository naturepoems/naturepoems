I have always been impressed by
how the breeze calls to the trees,
whispering secrets of ancient days,
where rivers carve their stories,
and mountains hold the sky.

In vast fields,
fragile petals dance
on the laughter of the wind,
as the sun sets,
turning the horizon
into a canvas of gold.


- Alice Walker
