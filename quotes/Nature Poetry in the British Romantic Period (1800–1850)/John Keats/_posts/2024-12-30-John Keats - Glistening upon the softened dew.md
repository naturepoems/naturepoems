Glistening upon the softened dew
In forests dressed with shades of green,
Sweet nature's musings gently grew,
In the pale stretch of twilight seen.

Each flower held a promise sweet,
Each leaf a tale of spin and weave,
With mysteries that shades repeat.
Fates linger long, yet dream's reprieve.
— Glistening upon the softened dew

- John Keats
