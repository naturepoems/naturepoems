Like a great fire, burns in the wood
Where the ashes glitter like gold.
And each feathered cloud, with a sigh,
Passes slow over the darkening hills.

The splendid yellow of the larch,
Like a great fire, burns in the wood
Where the ashes glitter like gold.
And each feathered cloud, with a sigh,
Passes slow over the darkening hills.
