The Ocean's Whisper

Waves crash against the shore,
a rhythmic applause of nature,
each tide a heartbeat,
each foam a fleeting kiss.
The salty breeze caresses softly,
sending shivers of nostalgia,
where every grain of sand
holds stories of the deep.

Beneath the surface,
a world of wonder breathes,
a dance of creatures,
a tapestry woven from life,
as we look out, lost in the horizon,
a longing for what lies beyond.

- Cecilia Ludovica Morandini
