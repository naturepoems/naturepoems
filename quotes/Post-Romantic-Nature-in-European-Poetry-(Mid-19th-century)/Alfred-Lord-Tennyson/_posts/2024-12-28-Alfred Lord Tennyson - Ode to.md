Ode to Memory

I
My spirit loved, or did not know,
As air hath voices and tones,
As waves the white cloud bright and low,
Or sunbeams scatter gems in stones.

II
And lo! among the ancient trees,
Where fragrance weaves a silken shroud,
The winds are whispering through the leaves,
And Nature sings to me aloud.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
