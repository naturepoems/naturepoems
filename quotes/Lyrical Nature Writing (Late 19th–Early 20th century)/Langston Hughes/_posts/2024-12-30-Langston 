Joy

Joy to the heart
Is a child at play,
Laughter floats up
To the sky so gay.

Nature's bliss
In the your eyes shines,
In every tree,
Love, so divine.

Joy's warm embrace
Wraps up each day,
As spring's soft rains
Gently wipe away.

For each bright dream
Seeks the sun's ray,
And joy's gentle heart
Seeks the love to stay.

- Langston Hughes
