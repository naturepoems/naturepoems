Frosted Boughs

In winter’s hush, the world turns white,
Like lace upon a sleeping earth,
The frosted boughs, a pure delight,
They cradle dreams, and whisper worth.

With every flake, a story spun,
Of icy magic and quiet grace,
In nature’s chill, we are all one,
As winter wraps us in its embrace.

- Marigold Johnson
