A piece of the sky,
   and a little glimpse of
         the horizon…
        Forms of new life,

in the folds of a
shell,
a solitary tree.
    Nature, the fleeting hush,
        where dreams hide.
     
there, in stillness,
   softness;  whispering wind,

     a bird’s call,
       echoes through
   empty spaces...

- Max Ernst
