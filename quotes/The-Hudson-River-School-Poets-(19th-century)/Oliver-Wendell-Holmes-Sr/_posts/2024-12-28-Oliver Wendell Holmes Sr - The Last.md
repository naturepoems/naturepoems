The Last Leaf

I saw him once before, as he
Looked at me, and then away,
Stretched before me, as the mothers
In their most joyful days, also
Droop and bow like trees
As I picture, now, the man,
Enthralled by a wild sunset haze.

A fervent whisper sings through
The golden leaf of his youth,
True to life, and I feel to rest
Over the heavy leaden frays.
What wiser words can a man sing, and
Memories sung so close to spring?

- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr
