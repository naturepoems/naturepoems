O Nature! thou art to the heart,
That plaintive strength, that subtle glow,
For wants beyond all mortal store,
Tame not the winds, nor tame the waves,
Let the eternal breezes spare
All things that must forever blow.
The happiness we dare not share,
Is better than what we must forbear.

-- Robert Southey, "Ode to Nature"
