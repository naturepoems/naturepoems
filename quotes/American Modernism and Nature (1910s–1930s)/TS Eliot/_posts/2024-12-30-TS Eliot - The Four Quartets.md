The Four Quartets

Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future,
And time future contained in time past.
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable.
Time past and time future
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present.

Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage we did not take,
Towards the door we never opened
Into the rose-garden.  
My word is the way of the few.

There is one final way\
A full grain of wheat – redemption in loss.
Let us not forget fate; what favors us,
And most of all, gentlemen, seize the day.  
This, for September and spring.
The one calls forth all spring,  
A show once more beyond semblance,
Where time takes us all to our close
Together again, at rest.


- TS Eliot
