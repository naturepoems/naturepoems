In summertime, the sun’s out all day long;  
At wintertime, the sky’s a chilly gray;  
Yet spring has come to bring us love and song,  
And flowers wake anew to greet the day.

The daffodils dance lightly in the breeze,  
The blossoms spill their fragrance everywhere;  
And all the world enchants, and all it sees  
The magic in the air, the love we share.

- A E Housman
