The eve casts its mantle, a cradle of stars,
while the world breathes softly, forgetting its scars.
Moonbeams caress the river, blurring the bars,
where dreams sail away in small, silvered jars.

Night animals stir, weaving shadows in play,
the rustle of leaves in a folk tale ballet.
Here nature elopes with the deepening night,
and the heart finds its place, in the quiet delight.


- Gustav Suits
