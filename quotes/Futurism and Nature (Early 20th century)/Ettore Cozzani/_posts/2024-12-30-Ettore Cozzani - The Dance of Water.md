Cascading down the cliffs,
Water dances in sunlight,
A cascade of laughter,
Tumbling fiercely into dreams.

Each droplet a messenger,
Bearing tales from the mountains,
Where ancient spirits linger,
Woven into the rocks and roots.

In this pure essence of flow,
Time is merely a whisper,
And the soul finds solace,
In the echo of natureâ€™s call.

With open hearts, we stand,
Beneath the breath of the earth,
And in reflections of the stream,
We see the depths of ourselves.

- Ettore Cozzani
