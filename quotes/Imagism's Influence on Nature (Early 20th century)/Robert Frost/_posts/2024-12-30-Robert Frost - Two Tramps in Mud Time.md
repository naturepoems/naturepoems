Two Tramps in Mud Time
The sun was warm but the wind was chill.
You know how it is with an April day.
When it is summer in the world, and all
But the trees' new leaves have come to green,

There should be those spindled boughs and limbs,
Not yet at all. It seems like overhead,
The roses are not yet at all in bloom,
Although the air is full of warmth.

I am glad to see the wind and smell,
The air is full of all the simple things,
That come back to me, and seem to come alive.
But is it really true, say the trampsâ€”
That nature is only, really dead?

- Robert Frost
