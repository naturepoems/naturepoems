Fields of Lavender

In fields where lavender blooms unfold,  
A fragrant dream, a story told.  
Each petal whispers soft and sweet,  
In nature's arms, our hearts will meet.
  
A violet sea, where time stands still,  
The sun kisses earth with gentle will.  
In every breath, a moment cherished,  
In fields of lavender, worries perish.


- Halfred Lee
