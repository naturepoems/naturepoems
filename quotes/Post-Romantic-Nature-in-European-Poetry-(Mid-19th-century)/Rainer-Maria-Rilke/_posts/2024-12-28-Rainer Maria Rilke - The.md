The Garden

Here, in the sanctuary of blooms,
Where colors explode like laughter,
And every petal opens a door
To the paradise within the heart.

Bees hum softly, settling in,
As the sun and the shadows play,
Creating a symphony of presence,
In a world where beauty holds sway.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
