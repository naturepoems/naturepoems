The Sound of Trees
I wonder about the trees,
Why do we wish to bear
Forever the great loss?

I wonder about the trees.
What do they seek in the forest
For what they could not keep?

Would we not wear our leaves
And colors of the season's falling,
And the warmth of our roots
Would we not feel them hunger?

But there is a sun
Upon the leaves and upon their bark.
Let the sun reign!
The wise dark trees will burn.


- Robert Frost
