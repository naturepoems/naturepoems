The View from My Window

This view,
filtered through the frame
of my simple life,
shows the great expanse,
green hills rolling away,
a horizon that holds
the secrets of the world.

I see the trees,
their branches intertwining,
dancing with the rhythm
of the wind—
a celebration of existence.

Each day,
the sun descends,
painting the sky
with strokes of orange and blue,
reminding us,
we are all part of it,

like the birds that mock time,
ignoring the ticking clock,
vocalizing their freedom,
echoing the song
of the universe
where all is connected,
where we belong.
