Pohutukawa Blooms

With crimson bells that set the night ablaze,  
Pohutukawa blooms in a fiery haze,  
As summer whispers sweet lullabies,  
Embracing the ocean beneath the blue skies.

Your blossoms burst forth with joyous delight,  
A herald of christmas in the warm twilight,  
Standing guard by the shore, where the waves kiss the sand,  
A symbol of love, of home, and the land.

May your beauty remind us of memories past,  
As we gather beneath you, friendships built to last,  
In the heart of summer, our spirits find peace,  
In the shade of your branches, our worries release.

- P E J M Taylor
