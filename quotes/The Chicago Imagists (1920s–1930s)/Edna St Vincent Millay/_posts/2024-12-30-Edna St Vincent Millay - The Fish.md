The fish, the fish!  
The fish in the brook!  
  
                     Their giddy way,  
             Their glimmering backs,  
             So light they seem,  
             So paint them bright  
             Up high above,  
             Their lips a-smile,  
             And, oh!  
            They leap back to my heart again,  
                  
                              In the hush of the night  
                           Beneath the stars.  
Plaything of waters!  
                 
                          The thistle-down,  
                     So soft, so fleet,  
            That dances down the lane!  
So soft, so fleet!  
              
                   Here,  
                             Under the air,  
                           Like petals blown  
                       Bending to the sun.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
