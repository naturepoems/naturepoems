The Scent of Spring

The scent of spring upon the breeze,
A fragrant promise of new life;

In every bud that gently frees,
A joy that crescendos like a fife.

Let me remember in my heart,
That nature speaks in every hue;

A world reborn, where love takes part,
To share with others, pure and true.


- Philip Freneau
