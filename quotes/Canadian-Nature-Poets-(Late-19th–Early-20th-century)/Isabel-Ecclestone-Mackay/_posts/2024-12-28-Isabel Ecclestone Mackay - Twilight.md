Twilight

The twilight drapes a velvet cloak  
In shadows streaked with gold,  
As nature's bosom softly breathes  
Her secrets, ages old.  

The murmuring of the distant sea  
Is music to my soul,  
And crickets serenade the dusk,  
As stars begin to roll.  

I watch the fading light depart  
As night slips in so sly;  
Oh, behold the turned face of earth,  
As day bids her goodbye.
