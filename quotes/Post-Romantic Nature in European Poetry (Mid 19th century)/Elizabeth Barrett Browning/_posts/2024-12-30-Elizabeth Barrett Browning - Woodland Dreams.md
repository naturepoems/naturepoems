O dearest woodland, fresh and bright,
With every leaf that dances free,
You cradle dreams in morning light,
And sing sweet tales of mystery.
A garden where the heart can soar,
Amidst the branches, bloom and sing.
You hush the world, and at your core,
Through nature’s grace, new life shall spring.
As shadows drift in echo's hue,
And whispers weave through twilight’s glow,
In nature’s heart, I find anew,
The beauty shared in every flow.


- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
