The Autumn Leaves
When autumn comes, the leaves find flight,
In swirling dances, pure delight,
Crisp air carries whispers loud,
The trees stand tall, a lovely crowd.

They twirl and spin in colors grand,
A tapestry by nature's hand,
As every leaf, a story told,
In golden hues, they shimmer bold.

- Mieczysław Wojnicz
