When winter's breath comes whispering,
And blankets the world in white,
The trees wear cloaks of silver,
As frost etches dreams upon glass,
In echoes of a silent night.

Every crackle in the stillness,
Is a secret of the cold,
Nature holds her breath in wonder,
As life takes a slumbering pause,
In the purity of snow's soft fold.
