The Fall of the Leaf
O yellow autumn leaves, how lovely you sway,
In your dance of gold and warm embrace of day,
Where whispers of the evening winds sighing low,
Gently kiss you down to the earth below.

I see you fall in graceful clusters true,
As summer wanes and the skies reflect your hue.
Oh, tell me, leaves, the tales of days long gone,
Of sunlight caught in a moment of song.

- William Butler Yeats
