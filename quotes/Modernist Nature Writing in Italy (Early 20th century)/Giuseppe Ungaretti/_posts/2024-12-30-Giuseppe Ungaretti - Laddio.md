L'addio

         Farewell.  
         You drift like foliage 
         With a mesmerizing embrace.
         As trees bend back,
         Intertwining with deep night,
         And sway like an old memory,
         Breathing in soft darkness,  
         Temporarily lost.
         
        
        
         


- Giuseppe Ungaretti
