Stars

The stars are shining, silver bright,  
In the velvet cloak of night;  
Each twinkle, each celestial glow,  
Tells secrets of the world below.

Oh, how they dance! Oh, how they play!  
In myriad forms, in bright array;  
A tapestry woven from dreams and sighs,  
Embroidered in the vast, dark skies.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
