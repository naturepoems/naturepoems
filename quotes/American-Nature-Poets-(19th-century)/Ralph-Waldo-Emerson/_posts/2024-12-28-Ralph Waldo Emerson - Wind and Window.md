Wind and Window Flower

Lament of the flower,  
And wishing thy bloom to glisten,  
When sudden the windows are all but shut,  
I feel thou thy spirit so deeply vibrant  
In nature's breath, now up untoned with you,  
Wishing as the pines do, in distant sense  
To speak with some being led to rest.  
- Ralph Waldo Emerson
