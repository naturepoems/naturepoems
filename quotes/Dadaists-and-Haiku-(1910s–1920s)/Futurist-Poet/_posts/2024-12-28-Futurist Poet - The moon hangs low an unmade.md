author: Futurist Poet
quote: "The moon hangs low, an unmade bed,
Stars scatter thoughts, experiences shred.
Time collapses in a cosmic rush,
Nature's heart beats in a fervent hush.

Every moment a canvas, every breath a stroke,
From chaos arises, life’s grand joke.
Windswept echoes, shadows in play,
Ode to the present, dissolving away."

The moon hangs low, an unmade bed,
Stars scatter thoughts, experiences shred.
Time collapses in a cosmic rush,
Nature's heart beats in a fervent hush.

Every moment a canvas, every breath a stroke,
From chaos arises, life’s grand joke.
Windswept echoes, shadows in play,
Ode to the present, dissolving away.
