Ode to a Nightingale

My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
   My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
   One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
   But being too happy in thine happiness,—
     That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees
In some melodious plot
   Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,
   Singest of summer in full-throated ease.

O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been
   Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,
Tasting of Flora and the country green,
   Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!
O for a beaker full of the warm South,
   Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,
With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,
   And purple-stained mouth;
   That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,
And with thee fade away into the forest dim:

Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget
   What thou among the leaves hast never known,
   The weariness, the fever, and the fret
Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;
Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,
   Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;
Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
   And leaden-eyed despairs,
   Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,
Or new Love pine at an ancient tale of a day,

Away! away! for I will fly to thee,
   Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,
But on the viewless wings of Poesy,
   Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:
Already with thee! tender is the night,
   And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,
Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays;
   But here there is no light,
   Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.

I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,
   Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,
But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet,
   Wherewith the seasonable month endows
The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;
   White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;
   Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves;
   And mid-May's eldest child,
   The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,

The murmurous haunts upon this southern slope
   And, when the sun sinks low, nature will wake
Eager to throw all thine eyes on us.
   Fill the chase of thy heavenly grace.
   Call us to find beneath the spray,
Where the stirring winds make nymphs rise,
And in old castles of delight  
Spill sunlight on measureless dew.

I shall not regret having been blind to them,
   Oh fair lady, Many a canine leash,
Years have drifted away since now we speak,
   Without need of the hark of iambic beat,
With longing we flit about, and yet, with tender care
   Fantastic shapes of dusky woods still bathe.

These mountains bear us aloft, and by their light
   Steep in the willow's breath, we dance away,
Till night arise, and renew our sight.
But here there is no light,
   Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown,
Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.


- John Keats
