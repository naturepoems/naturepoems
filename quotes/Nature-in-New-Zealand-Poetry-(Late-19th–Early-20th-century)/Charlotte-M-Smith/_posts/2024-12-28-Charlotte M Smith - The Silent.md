The Silent Wood
In quiet woods where shadows creep,  
The air is filled with dreams;  
The whispered hush that loves to keep  
The stillness of the streams;  
Where branches bow and sway with care,  
In soft and tranquil shade;  
Each moment lingers—breathes the air  
Of nature’s calm cascade.

With every step, on leaves that sigh,  
I wander long in peace,  
The silence speaks, in depths of sigh,  
As nature doth release  
Her secrets—softly as the dawn  
Is kissed with growing light,  
In woodlands where my heart has drawn  
Its joy from nature’s might.

- Charlotte M Smith
