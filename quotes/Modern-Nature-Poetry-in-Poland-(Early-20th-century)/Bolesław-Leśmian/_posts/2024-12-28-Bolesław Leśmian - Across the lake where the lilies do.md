Across the lake where the lilies do float,
And the world is wrapped in a silken embrace,
Nature conducts her eternal sweet note,
In the cadence of life, in her thrills we trace.

Echoes of laughter spill over the land,
In the arms of the flowers, the sun shall reside,
While shadows dance like the heartbeat of sand,
In this garden of secrets, where hearts confide.


- Bolesław Leśmian
