I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,
Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong;
The carpenter singing his as he measures his planks or beams,
The mason singing his as he makes ready for work,
Or leaves off work;
The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat,
The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench—
The hatter singing as he stands;
The wood-cutter’s song, the ploughboy’s on his way in the morning,
Or at noon intermission or at sundown.
 
                              
                             - Walt Whitman
