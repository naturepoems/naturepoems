A Moonlit Night

The moonlight has a chill  
That kisses the night flowers  
And makes them tremble,  
Each petal drinks it in  
Like cream poured on berries.

The bees are sleeping now;  
The stars laugh a little,  
Almost, in their bright hearts;  
There is a hush over the land,  
The world is silvered in peace.

- Amy Lowell
