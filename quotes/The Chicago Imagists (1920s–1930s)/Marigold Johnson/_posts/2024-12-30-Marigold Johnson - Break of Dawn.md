Break of Dawn

As dawn unfurls its golden wings,
The world awakens from its dreams,
In softness, light begins to sing,
And nature’s glory brightly gleams.

The morning dew, like diamonds laid,
Caresses all that comes to life,
In every note, the whispers played,
Reveals the beauty born of strife.

- Marigold Johnson
