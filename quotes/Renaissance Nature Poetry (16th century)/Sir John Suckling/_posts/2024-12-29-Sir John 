When evening falls and stars appear,  
A blanket of night draws ever near,  
Each twinkling light, a tale untold,  
Of friendships that the cosmos hold.  

With night’s embrace, my spirit’s free,  
To wonder at infinity,  
For in the hush, all becomes clear,  
As nature’s peace draws ever near.

- Sir John Suckling
