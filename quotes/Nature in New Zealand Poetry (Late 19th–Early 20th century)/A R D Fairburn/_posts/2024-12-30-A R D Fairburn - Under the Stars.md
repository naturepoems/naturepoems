Under the Stars

Beneath the stars, the earth awakes,
With secrets nestled in the night,
The moonlight bathes the world in grace,
In cosmic dance, no end in sight.

The universe, a wondrous quilt,
Stitched by the hands of fate’s decree,
In every twinkle, love is built,
For in the dark, we’re truly free.


- A R D Fairburn
