Sonnet V

My heart is warm, my heart is swift,  
With winds of love behind it blowing,  
And all the world, the purple twist,  
Swayed by each petal as it’s growing.  

So sweet the calm, so bright the air,  
Where love's wildflowers steeped in honey,  
Bring forth the clanks of laughter, fair—  
Beneath the sinuous sun, it’s sunny!  

Oh, grant me kind delight, my dear,  
A heart that quakes with gentle song,  
For every cloud is light out here—  
Each moment shared feels never wrong.  

— Edna St. Vincent Millay
