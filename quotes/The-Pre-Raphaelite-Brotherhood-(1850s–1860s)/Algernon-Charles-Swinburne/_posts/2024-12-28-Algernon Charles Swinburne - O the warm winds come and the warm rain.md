O the warm winds come and the warm rain falls,
And the trees stand heavy with a crown of emerald; 
More bright are the flowers than a maiden's eyes, 
More balmy the fragrance of the golden wild,
So the skies should bend down in the soft evening air.
- From "The Springtide"

- Algernon Charles Swinburne
