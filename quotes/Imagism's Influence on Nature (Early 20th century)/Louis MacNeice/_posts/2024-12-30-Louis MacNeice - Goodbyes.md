He stood in the sun on the green grass,
In a music of echoes and sighs,
And the skies were blue as the hours passâ€”
He said the world was full of goodbyes.

With petals blending in soft waves,
He beckoned them nearer, near:
The sweet of the fruit is spoken in graves,
While the echoes of laughter are near.


- Louis MacNeice
