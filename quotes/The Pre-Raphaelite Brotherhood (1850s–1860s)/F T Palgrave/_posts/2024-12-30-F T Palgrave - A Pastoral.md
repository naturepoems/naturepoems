A Pastoral
Come forth, my friend! the sun is bright;  
The birds are singing in the air,  
The flowers bloom in colors gay,  
And sweet the scents that wander there.  
Let us together roam the lane,  
Where trees in leafy shadows sway,  
Each step will blend with nature’s song,  
And chase the lingering clouds away.  
The rustling leaves, the bubbling brook,  
The whispers of the gentle breeze,  
Bring forth the joy, in every nook,  
As daylight dances through the trees.  
So come with me, through sunlit glades,  
Where life in beauty never fades!  


- F T Palgrave
