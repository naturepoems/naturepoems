IN NATURE’S GARDEN

In Nature's garden, where wonders abide,
With petals of color and fragrances wide;
The bees hum their prayers as they gather and play,
While flowers sway gently, in whimsical ballet.

The tenderest leaves dance in lavish delight,
As sunlight caresses the world into light;
And rivers, like ribbons, thread through the green,
In a splendor of colors both vibrant and clean.

Let us wander these pathways where beauty is found,
Where silence is loud in the beauty profound;
For in Nature's embrace, we find what we seek,
In whispers of love, where the heart cannot speak.

So take my hand, dear friend, let us roam wide,
For Nature’s own song is our faithful guide;
Together we’ll walk on this earth, ever true,
In the magic of life under skies so blue.

- Thomas Bracken
