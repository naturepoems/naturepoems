Wind

    I

    This is the wind that kills.
    An eddy forces life away
    Twisting the world into a jumble.
    I know this wind is a God, unyielding.

    II

    He will scissor the trees,
    Slice through roots, tumble stones, 
    Freeze breaths into screaming.
    I stretch my arms across the sprouting trees  
    Defending all hanging leaves and light from him.

    III

    Love of the mortal, hold back the rage, 
    Will spare our calm spirits and strength,  
    As he clears the timbers and sends leaves flying, 
    Releasing ghosts into the void,  
    For to hold on would bury life into dark silence… 

    IV

    Must I go to sleep?
    The trees will shake, exposing the earth.  
    I find I am just a residue.
    Unbounded energy will still demolish my heart.
