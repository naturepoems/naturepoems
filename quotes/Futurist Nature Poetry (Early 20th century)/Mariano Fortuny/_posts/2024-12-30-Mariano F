In the quiet of dusk, when the world turns to gold,
Nature’s own story begins to unfold.
With each falling leaf, a whisper is cast,
Reminding us all of the seasons that pass.

Let us gather these moments, like fireflies’ glow,
For in every heartbeat, the essence of flow.
In the canvas of life, where nature abounds,
Live deeply, love fiercely, in beauty we’ve found.

- Mariano Fortuny
