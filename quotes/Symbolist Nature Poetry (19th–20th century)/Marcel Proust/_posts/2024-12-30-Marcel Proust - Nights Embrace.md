The sky unfurls its vastness, tenderly it glows,  
A palette of colors, where deep indigo flows.  
Clouds like wistful dreams drift, soft and ephemeral,  
In this boundless expanse, I'm overcome by the celestial.  

Stars shimmer like diamonds, scattered with care,  
Each twinkle a story, a breath of the air;  
And as darkness blankets the world so wide,  
In stillness I ponder, with the night as my guide.  

Oh, let me revel in the quiet night's embrace,  
To lose myself wholly in this infinite space;  
With Nature above me, my heart beats in time,  
A whisper of eternity, a dance so sublime.

- Marcel Proust
