Summer
         The heat lingers
on branches,
     a soft hum
          settling deep,
   the flowers expand
     into the ground,
    staking their claim,
dancing around like children,
alive, we breathe deeply,
    savoring sun,
       all that comes,
         rays licking
and the green,
        bending with wishes,
who could resist?
          Summer,
        a story
          told in colors,
             a song
sung through the light.

— Frank O’Hara
