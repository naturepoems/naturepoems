There are mornings I wake
And feel the world breathing along with me,
The soft rustle of leaves, a gentle wind,
That carries whispers from the earth.
The sun stretches its golden fingers,
Gently nudging the stars away,
And in those lively moments, I remember—
Nature’s pulse syncs with my worries,
Welcoming me into its expansive embrace,
As I breathe into this vastness, find
a quiet haven in the warmth
Of life renewing itself, here, now,
A secret known in the blooms of spring.

— "Morning Embrace"
