A Patch of Old Snow
There’s a patch of old snow in a corner
That I should have looked in before.
But the buyer that I am today can see
The way the old snow lies-covered there,  
As though it were pregnant past two lives,
And smoothed by a moon of coming rain.

It’s an end I hold without regret,
And I’ve lost my memory of what came before,
Of old paths and drifts, like mounds of waves;
So plaited and weathered like a dream,  
Like whispering myth, where the wild wind stirs
Through every hair—that chorus gone, still held—
This snow’s the past that I can remember now.

How solemn and solemn shall it be:  
My light shall keep unfolding on another screen.
To pass along a lifted brow  
See only beauty in this cleftspring world’s ways,  
With joy till all ends ignite the breeze,
And gather every answer in its reach; 
That this patch of old snow written deep  
Springs back to anything; all the past  
Recreates its life in me.
There, diminutive illumination holds!
There’s wisdom in nothing—  
I breathe and watch the snow light workings of beauty.
Why, it’s lovely:  
That somewhere lives the old snow still behind
In corners waiting for light's embrace to bring us cleavy,
Ciphers gone from moon's sweet coronations of dust.
