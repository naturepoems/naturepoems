To Autumn

O Autumn, when the leaves fall free  
   Like dreams among the trees;  
With gold and garnet falling slow,  
   Winds lift them on the breeze.  
The earth is rich with rusted shades,  
   While birds take flight from shore;  
And all the world sings of the day  
   When we shall meet no more.  

â€“ Laurence Binyon
