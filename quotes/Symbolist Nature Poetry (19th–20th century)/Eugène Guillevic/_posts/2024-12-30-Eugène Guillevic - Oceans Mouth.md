The ocean's mouth opens,
when dusk spreads its wings,
  and light’s last tendril clings
  to the rocks and the waves.

In the whirl of blue,
   where the horizon bends,
   even dreams sail there,
      in silent paraphrase.
Into an endless meeting:
  sea and sky - a blaze.

Such is the life
of those who wander.
  The clangor of gulls,
    echoes, recedes;
  it leads to the depths,
  sinuous, undisclosed,
  where the pearl's white birth lurks.

Feel that, my love?
   The heart of our love lies
   in the pulse of the tide.
   Let us be born here, together,
   unwritten.

- Eugène Guillevic
