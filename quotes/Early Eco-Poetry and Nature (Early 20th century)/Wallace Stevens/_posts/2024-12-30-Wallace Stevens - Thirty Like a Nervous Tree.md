THIRTY LIKE A NERVOUS TREE

The trees stand stiff and tall
Like thirty almost perfect men,
Bigger than life, no pulse
But their shadows
That move, unlike clouds.
They shook no fruit;
They seemed too alive to bend.
They stood like boys,
Like girls ripe and warm,
Too satisfied to dim down,
Too decent to touch the grass.

I think they know me
More than I know them,
O fragile tree, boy, girl,
They stand at ease in the sun; 
To stay like simply as I sleep.

- Wallace Stevens
