---

The ancient trees, they bow and sway,
With stories etched in every ring,
And from their roots, the earth doth play,
A song of life, a timeless spring.

With ferns that curl and grasses sing,
In verdant fields where wildflowers grow,
Each bloom a gem, a vibrant fling,
Nature’s palette, a brilliant show.


- Rudolph Rudy H Dalrymple
