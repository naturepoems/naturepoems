Beneath the ocean's endless waves,
Where the world goes deep and cold,
Life thrives in hues of sapphire,
A realm of wonders untold.

Corals weave like magic carpets,
Fish dart in a ballet of grace,
Time lingers in the water's embrace,
In the depth, a timeless trace.

Here, the silence speaks volumes,
In the pulse of the tides' embrace,
Nature thrives in the dark and bright,
Creating harmony, a tranquil space.

- Julian Tuwim
