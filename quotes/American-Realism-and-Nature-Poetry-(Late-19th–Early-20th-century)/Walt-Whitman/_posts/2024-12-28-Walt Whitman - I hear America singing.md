I hear America singing,  
The varied carols I hear;  
Those of mechanics—each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong;  
The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam;  
The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work;  
The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat—the deckhand singing on the rail;  
The men and women singing in the fields;  
  
I hear America singing,  
  
And I am borne aloft by its mighty song.  


- Walt Whitman
