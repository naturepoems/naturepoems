The fragrance of the blooming rose,  
The gentle buzz of bees at play,  
In nature, life forever flows,  
In simple, sweet, and pure ballet.

Each color sings, each scent enchants,  
A symphony of life reborn,  
In gardens where the heart still dances,  
By natureâ€™s grace, our joy is sworn.

- Hjalmar Hegner
