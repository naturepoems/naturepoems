The Spirit of the Ocean

Waves crash upon the shore,
With a roar that sings of freedom,
Each foam a dancer's leap,
In rhythm with the universe.
The ocean breathes profoundly,
Echoing the heart of lands,
Carrying tales unseen,
From the shores of distant sands.

I walk along the water’s edge,
Where sea and sky embrace,
And lose myself within the whispers,
Of the ocean’s vast, gentle grace.
For in the endless swell of tides,
I find the pulse of all life,
The spirit of the ocean swells,
In tumult and in strife.

— Wole Soyinka
