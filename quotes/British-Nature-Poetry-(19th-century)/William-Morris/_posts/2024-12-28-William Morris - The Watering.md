The Watering Place

Torn, tangled edges of the wood,
                The sun-glare sets them bright,
Lost in amber solitude,
                While shadows weave with light.

Here I linger on green banks,
                Where lilies float in streams,
And the bubbling water thanks,
                The sun in golden dreams.


- William Morris
