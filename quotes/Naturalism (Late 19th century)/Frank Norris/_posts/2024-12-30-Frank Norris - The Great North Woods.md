The Great North Woods  
    --    An Ode to the Real Nature of Wilderness  
In the forest deep, where the shadows lay,  
And the winds weave tales in their gentle play,  
The great pines whisper secrets long untold,  
As the sun dips low in hues of gold.
 
Wild rivers run free, carving earthâ€™s embrace,  
With a power profound, a relentless grace;  
They sing to the stones, and the timeless trees,  
Of the ancient past, where nature breathes.
 
O, the air is fresh with the scent of pine,  
And the heart beats wild, in rhythm divine;  
For here in the wild, life's spirit abounds,  
In the pulse of the earth, true beauty resounds.
