The Grass divides as with a Comb,  
A spotted Shaft is seen –  
And then it closes at your Feet  
And opens further on –  

But the narrow Fellow in the Grass  
Is all the Truth upon –  
He likes a Whip of Downland –  
But now his lesson fades,  

You may not be too sure who came –  
Or if He came at all –  
The narrow Fellow in the Grass  
Is all the Truth upon –  

"The Grass divides as with a Comb"

- Emily Dickinson
