The Pathway

Through the park, the winding way  
   Unfolds before my feet;  
With flowers purple and white aglow,  
   And where the river meets.  
The whispers of the locusts faint,  
   And echoes of the throng;  
But here the dreams of nature reign,  
   And burst forth into song.  

â€“ Laurence Binyon
