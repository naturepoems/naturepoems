A FEVER

O do not love too long, sigh old, and thereby,
Whose lovely mind doth swell to silly joy,
Yet doth nothing shine, for harsh designs allowed,
That doth delight in suns to brighten nigh.

When love's regal means fall - too bright but dreams,
You be my passion; cast, driven to supply.
Though flame should leap to die, my heart's brightness gleams,
And handle plays me to some comfort drawn nigh.

Thus this love wound, lies blank; unmoved to claim
Your fond disguise, as bonds that came too late.
Whose bliss lashes breast could yet be based to shame,
For joy of breath has rolled long retention.'

- John Donne
