Crest of the Tide

At the crest of the tide, where the sea meets the shore,  
The waves tell their stories, always wanting more,  
With each gentle crash, comes a whisper of time,  
A melody woven, that’s rhythm and rhyme.

In the salt in the air and the sun on the sea,  
We find the adventures that make us feel free,  
Oh, let us embrace all that nature can bring,  
For in the crest of the tide, our spirits take wing.

- P E J M Taylor
