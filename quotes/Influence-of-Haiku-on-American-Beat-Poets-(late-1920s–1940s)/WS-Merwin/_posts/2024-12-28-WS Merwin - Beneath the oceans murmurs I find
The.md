quote: "Beneath the ocean’s murmurs, I find
The pulse of life, more ancient than time,
Where the deep reflects the sky's infinite gaze,
Coral gardens bloom in cerulean whispers,
Fish dart like thoughts, light tracing paths,
And within, the salt of the world, alive,
A rhythm of creation that knows no end."

Beneath the ocean’s murmurs, I find
The pulse of life, more ancient than time,
Where the deep reflects the sky's infinite gaze,
Coral gardens bloom in cerulean whispers,
Fish dart like thoughts, light tracing paths,
And within, the salt of the world, alive,
A rhythm of creation that knows no end.
