O’er mountain peaks, the eagles soar,
In circles wide, they chase the air,
In nature’s realm, they seek for more,
With every glide, they shed their care.

The heights of earth become their home,
In freedom’s flight, their spirit thrives,
As guardians of the freeing dome,
In wildness, every creature strives.


- William H Prescott
