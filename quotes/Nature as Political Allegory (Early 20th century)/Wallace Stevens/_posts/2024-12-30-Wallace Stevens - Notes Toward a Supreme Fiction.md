Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction

I
It must be abstract.  It must change.
It must give pleasure.

 II
Gipsy, lion, and bird: here somersaulting
  In the bright bubble of singing.

 III
There must be no universal weight,
  No eternal chime of the chord;
Forget the transcendental and the wild.

 IV
The event of science, the flesh of the know—
  The twist between the two and the what kettle,
The stir of figurative flowers;
Beast and earth together, a sun that dives—

V
In a reed that is bent it stakes a façade.
  Secure in its foundation of filth,
Drifting nights of it, now in consequence.


- Wallace Stevens
