Swan

The swan glides across the water,
a vision of perfect grace,
its wings powerful, wings tender—
yet, magnetically still.
Thus life beckons to learn,
to trust the body,
the beauty that moves from side to side,
like breath,
or years. 

I chase its story, as it metes out
tranquility, capturing the sun,
a gilded presence in its wake,
a celebration of all my own swimming, coming back,
a swan, mysterious and soft—
reminding me how to live,
how to return again and again,
full of love.

- Mary Oliver
