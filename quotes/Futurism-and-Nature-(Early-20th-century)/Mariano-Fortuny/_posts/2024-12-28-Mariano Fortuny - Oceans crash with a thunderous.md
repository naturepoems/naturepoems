Oceans crash with a thunderous roar,
Upon the shore, a rhythmic encore.
Seashells whisper stories of the tide,
Of distant lands where secrets hide.

The salty breeze, a lover's kiss,
In nature's arms, we find our bliss.
The sun dips low, a fiery embrace,
In the twilight's glow, we find our place.

- Mariano Fortuny
