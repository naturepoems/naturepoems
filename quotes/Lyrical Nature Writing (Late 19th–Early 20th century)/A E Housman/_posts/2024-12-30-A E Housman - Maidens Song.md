MAIDENS' SONG

The birds are singing in the trees,
The sun is shining from the sky:
And you, dear maidens, you are free,
And I would have you come with me
To the sweet common where we lie.  

The fields are covered with flowers,  
And the brook runs clear and bright,
So let us gather the blooms and be
Like the birds that sing with glee,
In our hearts all day and night.  


- A E Housman
