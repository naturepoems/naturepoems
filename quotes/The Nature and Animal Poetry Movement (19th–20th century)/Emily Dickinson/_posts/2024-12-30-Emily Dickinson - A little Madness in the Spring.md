A little Madness in the Spring  
Is wholesome even for the King—  
But God be with the Clown—  
Who ponders this tremendous Scene—  

This whole Experiment of Green—  
As if it were his own—  
In France—the first and last of men—  
With a little Madness in the Spring—  

Is wholesome—certainly for the Queen—  
And the Clown must droop his gaze—  
On the Flowers, and must wander hence  
To Nature's Garden there!  


- Emily Dickinson
