In twilight’s tender glow we meet,  
Where silver streams serenely flow,  
The orchestral sound of life’s retreat,  
With echoes soft of long ago.

What dreams in colors bright abound,  
Each leaf a secret to unfold,  
In every rustling, whispered round,  
The timeless tales of ages told.

- John Everett Millais
