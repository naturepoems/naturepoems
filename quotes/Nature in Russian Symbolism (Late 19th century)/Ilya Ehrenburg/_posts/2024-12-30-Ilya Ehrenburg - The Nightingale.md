The Nightingale
In the gentle dusk, the nightingale sings,
A melody wrapped in fragrant air;
Her notes flutter like the tender wings
Of dreams that float and linger there.

With every chirp, she beckons the stars,
To dance among the shadows cast;
In twilight's glow, love's echoed bars,
Remind us of the fleeting past.

- Ilya Ehrenburg
