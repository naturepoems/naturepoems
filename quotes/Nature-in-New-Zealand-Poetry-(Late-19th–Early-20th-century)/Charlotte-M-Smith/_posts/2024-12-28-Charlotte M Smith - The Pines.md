The Pines  
The pines wave on the bright blue hills  
Where evening lingers late,  
And murmurs soft the sweet, sweet rills  
Which flow at nature’s gate;  
They sigh to every breath of air  
And point their gloaming tips  
To heaven’s fading colors there,  
Where daylight gently slips.

Each needle sparkles as it sways  
With shadows dark and bright,  
And with the flowers pause to play  
When day becomes the night,  
For nature’s heart, in purest sleep  
Doth set her sighing trees,  
And in the stillness, calm and deep,  
Join whispers that to please.

- Charlotte M Smith
