A Tui's Song

In the depths of the forest green,
Under a blue that is ever serene,
The Tui trills, so sweet and clear,
Notes that dance on the breeze, we hear.

With feathery wings, it flits about,
In the blooms of the flax, there's no doubt,
The nectar flows, a feast divine,
Sipping nature’s brew, the Tui dost dine.

Oh, melodies echo through mossy glade,
In shadowed nooks where the silence played,
Life awakens with each vibrant sound,
In the heart of the wild, where joy is found.
