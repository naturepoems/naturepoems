A Snowstorm
Out of the poised darkness while the wind,
Half sob and half a whisper, records the night,
The air is filled with genuflections of light:
The snow, in all its nifty puffs, unpinned.

Each flake, a simple orb, comes rushing fast,
As poet’s breath takes flight with every spell,
A joke of wit employed where all may dwell,
‘Yonder diamond flecks past.’

In quietude, a solemn stillness there,
Where night blankets in a dreamy lure,
The snowflakes fall and with them carry prayer,
A mantle soft for hearts that seek for sure.

This timeless hushed repose a world anew,
Each flake a keeper of our hopes in gray,
Thus, on the ground where all gives way today,
The snow descends like grace—the heart is true.

- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr
