Rain

In the hush of quiet hours,
A rain began to play upon the roof,
The sound was an echo of a thousand flowers,
As joy broke silence, in sweet reproof.

The drops, they danced like elves of light,
Filling the world with a silver cheer,
In the depth of shadows, they broke the night,
And carried redemption, nothing to fear.

So, let the rains come down with grace,
Pour blessings upon the earth from high,
And let it cradle every weary face,
As life awakens beneath a wider sky.




- Stephen Crane
