quote: "A bird shapes its verse on a line of dawn,
Calls to the lingering stars, untouched, unwatched.
The fluttering joy clings to the evening sky—
The soft end notes held tight in the dark,
As flowers open under a twilight calm
That brushes the night with sweet, strange warmth."

A bird shapes its verse on a line of dawn,
Calls to the lingering stars, untouched, unwatched.
The fluttering joy clings to the evening sky—
The soft end notes held tight in the dark,
As flowers open under a twilight calm
That brushes the night with sweet, strange warmth.

- Marianne Moore
