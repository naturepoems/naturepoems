Dewdrops
  
  In morning light, the dewdrops gleam,
  Like tiny jewels on blades of grass;
  They sparkle bright, a waking dream,
  A fleeting glimpse of time that’ll pass.
  
  Each droplet holds a world within,
  Reflecting skies of azure blue;
  A mirror’s touch, where hopes begin,
  As nature whispers soft and true.
  
  With warmth of day, they slowly wane,
  Their brilliance lost in sun’s embrace;
  Yet still, the heart will seek again,
  The beauty found in nature’s grace.
