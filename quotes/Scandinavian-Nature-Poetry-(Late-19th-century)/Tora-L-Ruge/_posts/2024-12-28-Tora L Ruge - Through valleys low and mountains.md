Through valleys low and mountains high,
The winds carry, the echoes sigh,
In every corner, life’s embrace,
Each creature finds its sacred space.

The dance of clouds, the sun’s warm kiss,
In nature’s realm, there’s endless bliss,
For every heartbeat in the wild,
The universe sings, its spirit wild.
