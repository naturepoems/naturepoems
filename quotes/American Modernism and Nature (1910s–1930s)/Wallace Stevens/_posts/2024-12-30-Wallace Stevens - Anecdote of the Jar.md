Anecdote of the Jar

I placed a jar in Tennessee,
And round it went
Upon a hill.
It made the slovenly wilderness
Surround that hill.

The jar was gray and bare.
It took dominion everywhere.
The jar was round upon the ground
And tall and of a port in air.

The wilderness rose up to it,
And sprawled around, no longer wild.
It did not give of bird or bush
Like nothing else in Tennessee.



- Wallace Stevens
