Beneath the canopy of the night,
The stars like jewels glitter and gleam,
Softly the moon’s pale silver light,
Casts shadows deep in dreams and dreams.

The trees stand tall like guardians grand,
Their leaves whisper secrets of the past,
As if they here on ancient land,
And time itself has not gone fast.

For in the silence, all is clear,
With every breath, I feel my soul, 
Nature's beauty is ever near,
In her embrace, I feel whole.

- George Gordon Byron
