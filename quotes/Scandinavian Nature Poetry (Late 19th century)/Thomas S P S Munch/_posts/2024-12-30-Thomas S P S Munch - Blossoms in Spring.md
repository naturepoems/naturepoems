Blossoms in Spring
Awake, dear heart, to nature's song,
where blossoms don their garb of spring,
petals unfurl and life grows strong,
a palette rich, as joy takes wing.

The earth rejoices, a fragrant chest,
with every scent, new hopes arise,
where vibrant colors seek their rest,
a canvas stretched beneath bright skies.

Each bloom a wish, a tale of light,
in the garden's cradle, loveâ€™s embrace,
a reminder that through darkest night,
spring brings forth life, divine and grace.


- Thomas S P S Munch
