In winter’s grasp, beneath the skies,
The white snow veils the silent ground,
But in the distance, softly rise
The bold outlines of trees profound.

The stillness shrouds the world tonight,
And through the air, as echoes wend,
The haunting whispers turn to light,
And beauty, in her shimmer, blend.

- George Edward Woodberry
