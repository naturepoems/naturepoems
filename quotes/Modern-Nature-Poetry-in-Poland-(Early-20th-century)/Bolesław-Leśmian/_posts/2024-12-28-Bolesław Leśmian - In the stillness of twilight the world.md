In the stillness of twilight, the world holds its breath,
As shadows stretch long and day starts to fade,
And the echoes of nature sing sweet songs of death,
In the cycle of beauty, where all is remade.

With the stars reawakening, the night comes alive,
And dreams paint the skies with their wispy allure,
In the embrace of the dark, we learn how to thrive,
For in nature's soft stillness, our spirits are sure.


- Bolesław Leśmian
