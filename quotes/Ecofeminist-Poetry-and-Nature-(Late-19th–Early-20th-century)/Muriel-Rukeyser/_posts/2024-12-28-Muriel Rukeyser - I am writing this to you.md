I am writing this to you   
from the end of a line,   
not from the center,   
not from the beginning.   

You and I shall not be in the sun   
as we traverse the world,   
drenched in the tempest   
of our speech.   

We take a path of trees   
that each has its own light--   
that is not ours.   

But the wind finds   
the irises, and the orchids   
by the river.  
The light   
reaches us as   
glory, and we listen   
to the sound of the earth.  

We breathe softly,   
we live and die,   
and still the trees remain.
