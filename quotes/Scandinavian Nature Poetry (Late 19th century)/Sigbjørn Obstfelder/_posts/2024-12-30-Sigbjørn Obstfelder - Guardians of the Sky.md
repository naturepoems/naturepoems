The mountains rise, fierce guardians of the sky,
Their peaks piercing clouds, adorned in snow;
A realm where eagles soar, wild and free,
And the echoes of ancient tales still flow.

As I wander through valleys lush and bright,
The sun spills gold upon the verdant land;
Rivers sing, weaving tales of old,
And I am but a witness, a listening hand.

- Sigbjørn Obstfelder
