The sun was warm but the wind was chill.
You know how it is with an April day.
When it’s sunny and bright, it’s not warm but it’s
Not colder than a couple of degrees.

So there I stood in the sun, and thought warm thoughts 
Of outside’s immense sky, the way I could sway,
Enveloped in sun, but the wind, still, took me.
And it was April, the time we’ll fly away.

At time, I might have wished but for today,
I will watch the world, listen to it say
That it’s not just warm. That wind, you know
Has a voice of its own, and it can put you in your place.

I can’t say where I am going, but I feel the heat peak,
Just as that wind, there, will take me away
And let me return to the sky, on this most perfect day.

- Robert Frost
