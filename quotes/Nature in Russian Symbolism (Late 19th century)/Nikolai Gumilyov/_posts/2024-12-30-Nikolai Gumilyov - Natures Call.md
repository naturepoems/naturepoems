Nature's Call

The forest sings, the river flows,
With every breath, the earth awakes,
In every heart, the beauty grows,
As nature calls, the spirit shakes.

The mountains tower, ancient and wise,
Guardians of the dreams untold,
In their shadows, the canvas lies,
A masterpiece of life, of old.

The sun and moon, in rhythm dance,
As day and night embrace the land,
In nature's arms, we find our chance,
To lose ourselves, to understand.

Oh, answer her call, embrace the wild,
For in her heartbeat, life is sung,
In beauty fierce, like nature’s child,
In every moment, we are young.

– Nikolai Gumilyov
