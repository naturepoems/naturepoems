So let us wander ‘neath the skies,
  And feel the earth beneath our feet,
  With every sunset, new surprise,
  A bond with nature pure and sweet.

For life is but a fleeting spark,
  In nature’s vast and endless sea,
  Let’s cherish each and every arc,
  And find our joy, eternally.

- Isaak Walton
