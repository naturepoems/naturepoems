The Fall of Hyperion
A vision at morning dream’d I; how that world
Was wrapped within the climes so carefree—
But now so sweet the blood of destiny flows,
That all's delight crumbles at nature’s breeze—
As creatures blend their sounds in the soft glow...

Amidst those leaves whispering wise,
Out of sweet resignation to embrace the sky;
Where we gazed at nature's sights in time,
And never let the tenderness die.

- John Keats
