Wind

I

This shaking keeps me steady.
I should know. What winds blow
And lift me would hurl
The world past my window.

II

Wind is like a tree, breathing, stretching
Out its wooden arms that sway,
Its fingers on the sky.
I hurl myself into it
And the trees bow to my mayhem
And moan to me.

III

Wind brings the wild hunger,
The cry of a thousand birds,
The treble of voices,
Sensation, life, a passion,
This pulse of the earth weaving cycles._

IV

It is natureâ€™s press against me,
That satisfaction of mountain moves,
And I feel my own bones stir,941
Filling the echo of its roar.

- Ted Hughes
