The land of lost content
I see it shining plain,
The glory of the proud,
The story of the slain.

The land of lost content,
It lies beyond the sea,
The land to which I would
I should not return, but as a thought to me.

And whether far or near,
Whether a thought or home,
I shall have to outlive all,
To outlive the deadly dome.

- A E Housman
