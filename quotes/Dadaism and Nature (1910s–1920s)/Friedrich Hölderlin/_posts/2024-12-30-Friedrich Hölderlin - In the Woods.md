In the woods, where shadows dwell,  
The trees stretch high, like thoughts turned inward,  
Their branches weave silence into song,  
And the earth resonates with dreams unsung.
  
Nature's breath, a calming sigh,  
Cradles the spirit, life's gentle cry,  
Open hearts, like petals unfurl,  
In the sanctuary of this verdant world.


- Friedrich Hölderlin
