The Pond

I see a world of small, unseeable things,
a world that can only be visited
in the silent hours of dawn,
when the water looks like glass
and memory is clear.
Under the water the little fish brush past
like shadows in a dream.
There is a sudden plunge of wings;
a great blue heron rises,
turning its head to look at me
as if I were the ghost.
In this quietness of a pond,
we are all ghosts, drifting,
reflecting the light, the ones who have passed away,
those who are still alive,
even the water plants that reach and shiver
in the light that is slipping away.

- Mary Oliver
