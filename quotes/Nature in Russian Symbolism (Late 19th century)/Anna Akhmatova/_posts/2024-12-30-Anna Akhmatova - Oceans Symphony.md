The sound of the ocean, a never-ending song,
Calls to the heart of the soul that is lost,
The waves hold memories of loves and desires,
In the cradle of time, they weigh less than cost.

The tide that ebbs and flows with the moon,
Reminds me of patience in lifeâ€™s vast embrace,
Each ripple a moment that carries a dream,
In the spacious expanse, I find my place.


- Anna Akhmatova
