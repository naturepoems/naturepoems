Ode to the Sky  
The sky stretches,  
a vast infinity,  
where clouds curl  
like playful dreams  
rolling past the sun—  
a painted canvas,  
blues and whites,  
flashes of pink,  
where thoughts wander,  
drifting in the atmosphere.

A bird pierces  
the thickness of the air,  
a musical note,  
winged ambition,  
a freedom dance  
under the vast ceiling  
of existence.  
In this boundless expanse,  
a million moments echo.

And I find myself  
in this grand disarray,  
aligned with the universe—  
vulnerable yet fearless  
under its azure embrace.

- Richard Huelsenbeck
