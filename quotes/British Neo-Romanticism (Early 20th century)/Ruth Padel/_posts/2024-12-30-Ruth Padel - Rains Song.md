Rain’s Song
Today the rain dances down,  
a soft caress against the ground,  
as it gifts the thirsty earth  
with each precious drop.

Puddles form, nature’s mirrors,  
reflecting a world in motion,  
where the joyous rhythm of raindrops  
mesmerizes, a gentle lullaby.

With every splash, a spark of life  
awakens in the soil,  
promises of blooming,  
as the world washes clean,  
eager for a rebirth.  

So let this rain fall,  
as I breathe in the scent of renewal,  
especially born on nature’s tears,  
grace notes echoing through the air.

- Ruth Padel
