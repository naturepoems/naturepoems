I heard a Fly buzz – when I died –  
The Stillness in the Room  
Was like the Stillness in the Air –  
Between the Heaves of Storm –  

The Eyes beside – had wrung them dry –  
And breaths were gathered sure  
For that last Onset – when the King  
Be witnessed – in his Power –  

I willed my keepsakes, Signed away  
What portion of me be  
Assignable – and then the Fly  
Laid its Marquee –  

With my Life’s air –  
And I debated where  
To outwit the rest,  
As through the sides of me –  


- Emily Dickinson
