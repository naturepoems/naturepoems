Whispers of the Sea
Upon the cusp of dusk’s embrace,
The sea hums softly, in wicked grace,
Crashing tales upon the sands,
Of aging ships, of foreign lands.

O, the waves they dance, with frothy flight,
In relentless rhythms, a sweet delight,
Kissing the shores with tender might,
Under the stars' watchful sight.

What secrets do you hold in your foam?
Where do you wander, far from home?
In the whispers, a sage of time, a lore,
In your deep mysteries, I implore.

- Wole Soyinka
