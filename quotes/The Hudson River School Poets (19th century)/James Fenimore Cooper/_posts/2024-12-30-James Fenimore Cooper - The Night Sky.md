The stars in the heavens,
   A tapestry bright,
Where the dreams of the wanderers
   Are woven to light.

With the moon like a lantern,
   That hangs in the sky,
It guides my steps onward
   As the moments drift by.

In the silence of twilight,
   My spirit feels whole,
For the night is a canvas
   That paints the soul.

- James Fenimore Cooper
