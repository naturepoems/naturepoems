Summer Night
The thick dark shadows
Of the whispering trees,
For the moon is too bright
  In the velvet night.

The stars are all smiling,
As their twinkle suggests
That the summer is new
And the world is at rest.

Let the soft night ease
  Every wavering ache,
And let your heart sway
  In the beauty awake.

- Langston Hughes
