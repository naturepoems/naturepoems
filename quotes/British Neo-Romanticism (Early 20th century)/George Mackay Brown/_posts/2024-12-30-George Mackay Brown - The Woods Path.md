The Woods Path

The narrow path through the woods,
Lined with ferns and ancient stones,
Where shadows play games with the light,
And the hush of the world envelops,
A sanctuary of whispered thoughts.

Birdsong rises, a flute-like echo,
As if nature sings its secret hymns,
And with every step upon the carpet of moss,
I feel the heartbeat of the earth,
A pulse of life, strong and enduring.


- George Mackay Brown
