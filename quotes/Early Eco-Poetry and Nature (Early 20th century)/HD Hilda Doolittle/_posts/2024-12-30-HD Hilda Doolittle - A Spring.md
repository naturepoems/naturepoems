A spring  
has not passed; 
not a leaf,
or twig hath ceased,  
- from the return  
of spring  
arising- 
in the green flow,  
a thousand years;
in the long depth
or sleep,  
a pearl rippling,  
in the water.
- Your finger-  
your soft touch  
- would not shatter,  
what yesterday, when there was no more- 
- nor all the  rivers pass. 
Would you wear, my love, 
- or marvel, choke,  
- would you of a stream,  
a soft thing, a wisdom as a flower? 
- My heart aches, 
you are there; 
you are absent.

- HD Hilda Doolittle
