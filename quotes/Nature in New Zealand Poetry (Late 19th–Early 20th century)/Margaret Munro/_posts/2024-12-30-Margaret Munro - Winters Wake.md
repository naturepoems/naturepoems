Winter's Wake

The frost lay upon the ground,  
A crystal veil without a sound,  
But deeper still, as sun did break,  
A promise where the lilies wake.

Through barren fields, the whispers creep,  
As Winter's sorrows slowly sleep,  
And tender shoots reach for the sky,  
In hope that Spring is drawing nigh.

With laughter, colors soon return,  
And life anew begins to burn,  
Oh gentle Earth, in your embrace,  
Each season tells of nature's grace.

- Margaret Munro
