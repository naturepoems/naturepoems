A morn of joy, a day of bliss,
With every flower that blooms will kiss;
The birds that sing, the trees that sway,
In harmony, they greet the day.

For in each petal, in each leaf,
There lies a whisper, deep belief;
That nature speaks in tones refined,
And echoes in the heart and mind.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
