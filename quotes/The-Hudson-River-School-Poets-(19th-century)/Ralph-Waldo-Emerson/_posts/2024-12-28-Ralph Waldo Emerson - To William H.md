To William H. Channing

When in the woods, this bough I hold,
With buds of promise, to unfold
The treasures of its life, so bright,
Erewhile hidden in the night.

The twilight, veiling distant hills,
Casts shadows at my feet, and fills
My heart with hope and wonder free,
As from the bough I glean a plea.

Take close the song of leaves and trees,
And learn the thoughts that nature frees;
Let hearts to highest things aspire,
And kindle in the soul desire.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
