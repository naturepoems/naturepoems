When Sun and Moon Collide

When sun and moon collide at dusk,
  And colors blend and flow,
The memories of day unmask,
  A soft and gentle glow.

The twilight paints the world in hues,
  Of lavender and rose;
In every shadow, joy ensues,
  While night begins to close.

The stars awaken, twinkling bright,
  Like diamonds on a sea;
Each one a wish, a glimpse of light,
  That calls the heart to be.

In this dark dance of time and space,
  I find my deepest dream;
For in this quiet, sacred place,
  My spirit learns to gleam.

So let the day and night unite,
  In harmony sublime;
For in their dance, I gain the sight,
  That transcends even time.
