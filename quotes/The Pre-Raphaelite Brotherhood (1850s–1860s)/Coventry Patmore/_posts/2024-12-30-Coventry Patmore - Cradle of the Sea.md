In a cradle of the sea, alone,
The shimmering waves shall bring,
All the fears of silent leaves and stone.
Each cloth of life its sting,
Makes every heart beat freedom towards,
Where the night's bright wings did cling.

A drop shall echo on the hard,
Once washed in the arms of a cloud,
Will hang the waves of white beyond,
Cry from the eyes of the proud.

- Coventry Patmore
