The Singing Brook  
Oh, merry is the brook that sings  
Amid the rocks and mossy springs;  
It dances on with joyful glee,  
A laughing child so wild and free.  

Through emerald glades and valleys wide,  
It whispers tales with every tide;  
In every note, a joy profound,  
With nature’s grace, it weaves around.
