The gentle breeze upon the hill,
Meets blooms of rich and varied hue;
The songbirds drown the woodlands’ thrill,
And stir the dreams to life anew.

Yet as the dusk falls soft and kind,
The stars arise, the growing night;
Enwrap me close, I'll leave behind,
This world and seek the moon's sweet light.

Let nature’s wonders fill my core,
From dawn to dusk, her voice inspire;
A tranquil peace forevermore,
In beauty found, my heart's desire.

- James Russell Lowell
