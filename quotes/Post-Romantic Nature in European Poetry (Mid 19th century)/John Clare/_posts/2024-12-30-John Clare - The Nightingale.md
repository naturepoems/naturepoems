The Nightingale

A glorious sound is in the vale,
A nightingale sings on the gale;
With notes so sweet, and passion clear,
It fills the heart, while drawing near.

In every brake, each lovely glade,
Its airy notes weave forest shade,
So soft and sweet; with rapt delight,
Itâ€™s felt through woods in evening light.

So silent are the sad-struck oaks,
That listen to its happy yokes,
For spring has come on soothing breeze,
And each sung note whispers of peace.

- John Clare
