Each morning as the sun wakes,
its fingers stretch across bright horizons,
blessing all of life anew.

    |
Birds break the silence,
orchestrating a morning hymn,
a rhapsody of color,
a celebration unbound by time,
a symphony leading forth,
inviting even the shyest
of hearts to rejoice.

    |
This world is a canvas,
each breath a brushstroke,
a tremor in the veins of existence,
a moment caught in the flow
of nature's endless performance.

- Philip Whalen
