The Sea

Oh mighty sea, your strength is wide,  
With waves that crash and ebb with pride,  
You cradle ships and whisper dreams,  
A realm of wonders, wild extremes.

The gulls do dive with joyful cries,  
As sunsets paint the evening skies,  
In every wave, a story flows,  
Of distant shores and sands that glow.

Oh, endless depth, where freedom sings,  
In your embrace, my spirit springs,  
For in the tides, both fierce and free,  
I find my peace, oh mighty sea.

- Margaret Munro
