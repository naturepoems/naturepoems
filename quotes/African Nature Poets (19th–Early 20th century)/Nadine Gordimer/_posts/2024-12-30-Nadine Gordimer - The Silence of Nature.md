I remember the dominance
of the thorn and the acacia,
the whispers of the wind
through needle-leaved trees,
infinitesimal movements in the golden grass.

Indian summer, and the fireflies.
Night closes in,
the stars become the only masters
of the deepening darkness.
Oh how I long for that silence
which envelops all in its embrace.

Let me breathe in the scent of earth, 
the dampness of decay,
ot the harshness of city breath, 
a place of wild things,
where life was once abundant.

- Nadine Gordimer
