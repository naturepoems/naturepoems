Morning  
   
Awake, my heart, to morning light,  
As nature stirs from dreamful night,  
With golden beams that dance and play,  
In every leaf, the dawn’s bouquet.  
  
The chorus of the waking birds,  
A melody that stirs the soul,  
In tranquil fields, where beauty’s heard,  
As life returns, we feel it whole.  
  
O morning bright, with hope you bring,  
In every breath, our spirits rise,  
With nature’s gifts, our hearts take wing,  
In joyous light, the world complies.

- Herman Melville
