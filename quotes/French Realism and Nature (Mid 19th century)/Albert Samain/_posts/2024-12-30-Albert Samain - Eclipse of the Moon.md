Eclipse of the Moon

When shadows dance on amber dunes,
And night paints dreams in silver light,
The moon dons a veil, a rare cocoon,
Whispering secrets, soft and slight.

With stars, she holds a silent court,
As crickets serenade the air,
The world, a stage with lessons taught,
In stillness, deep as night’s despair.

Yet through her veil, a glow peeks shy,
A promise that dawn will rise again,
For in the depths of even the dark sky,
Hope holds its breath amidst the pain.

So here I stand, beneath this sight,
Let not the shadows sway my soul,
For in the moon’s deep grace tonight,
I find the energy of whole.

- Albert Samain
