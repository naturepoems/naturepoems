The Mountain Pine

In silent woods where pine trees grow,
I find a peace the world can’t show.
Their scent of earth and air combined
Is balm to body, heart, and mind.

The roots run deep, the needles sway,
In every wind that comes to play.
And standing proud against the sky,
The mountain pine soars high and nigh.

With whispers of the past they speak,
In every bough, a wisdom sleek.
In nature’s heart, they stand alone,
Majestic and unyielding tone.
