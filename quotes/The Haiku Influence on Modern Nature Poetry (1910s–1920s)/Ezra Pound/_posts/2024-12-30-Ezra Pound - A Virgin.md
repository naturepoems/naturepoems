A Virgin
A naked woman in a thirteen-rowed castle
   Together with soldiers—our mouths shut together.
Not afraid to laugh; as the sun slides past,
   The good morningpeace, under your apple trees
        Waits as the very peace of dawn—
Make the sunshine willow—
    A child plucks flowers, shivers.
To the woman who saw the gentle light;  
   And every year sleeps in the wave, 
      And breathing sends the flame.

- Ezra Pound
