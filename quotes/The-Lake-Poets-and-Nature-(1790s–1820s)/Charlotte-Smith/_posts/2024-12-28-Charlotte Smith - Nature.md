Nature

In quietude, along the streamlet’s flow,
The light and shadow play, through vale and grove;
The flowers smile bright, while all the wild things grow,
Their hues reflecting nature’s purest love.

From every green and fragrant place they rise,
The world should love, and learn from nature's guise.

— Charlotte Smith
