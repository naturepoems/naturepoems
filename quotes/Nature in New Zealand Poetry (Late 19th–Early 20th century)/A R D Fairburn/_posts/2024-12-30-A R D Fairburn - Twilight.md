Twilight

When twilight spreads her curtain wide,
A hush descends upon the land,
The sun dips low, a fiery guide,
Lighting the sky with golden hand.

The shadows lengthen, cool and deep,
As stars blink softly into sight,
And nature cradles us to sleep,
In whispered peace, the end of light.


- A R D Fairburn
