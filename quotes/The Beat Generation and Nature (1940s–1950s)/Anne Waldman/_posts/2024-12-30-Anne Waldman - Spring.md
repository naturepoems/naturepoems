Spring
among the daffodils
I found a small brown nest
with streaks of feathery down
in it.
dry leaves rustled
under my feet,
sunlight cradled the quiet birds,
wrapped them in soft wool.

I think of the blush of spring,
its laughter spilling like them, 
on my shoes.
shaking off the shadows 
from winter's floor.
as birds took to the sky,
filling it with song.

Anne Waldman
