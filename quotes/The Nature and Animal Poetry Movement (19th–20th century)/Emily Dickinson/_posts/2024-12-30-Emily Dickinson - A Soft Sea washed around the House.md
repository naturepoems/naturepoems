A Soft Sea washed around the House  
A Soft Sea washed around the House  
A Sea of soft, soft sand—  
Nothing but a wisdom change  
Can make this wise and grand—  

That Sea took all Mary Jane  
And he could not make it clear  
For all the little stitch of thought  
Was silken on the air—  

Brown crickets creeping hitherward  
And crickets creeping there  
But then the Sea will make it good  
If they only fix their hair—  

So let it weave the just, true thread  
And towards the light a day  
A Sea of soft, soft sand—  
With an honest tree afloat—  

So shall I care a—wound at all  
While Mary Jane's adrift—  
I saw the softest Sea around  
It was a soft gift.  


- Emily Dickinson
