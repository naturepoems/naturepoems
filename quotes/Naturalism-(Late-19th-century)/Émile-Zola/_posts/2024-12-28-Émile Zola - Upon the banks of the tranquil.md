Upon the banks of the tranquil stream,
Where ripples dance in the golden light;
The willows sway in a tender dream,
Embracing the whispers of the night.

Frogs croak a song to the evening star,
As fireflies begin their nightly tune;
Nature's orchestra, sweet and bizarre,
Plays under the watchful gaze of the moon.

- Émile Zola
