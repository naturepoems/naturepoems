As twilight falls, the stars appear,  
In velvet skies of midnight blue,  
Each twinkle tells a story dear,  
Of dreams that dance, and wishes true.  

Beneath the boughs, I sit in peace,  
With natureâ€™s symphony around,  
In this stillness, my worries cease,  
And in the quiet, joy is found.

- William Ellery Channing
