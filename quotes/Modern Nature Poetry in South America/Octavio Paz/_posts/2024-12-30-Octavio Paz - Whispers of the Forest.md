I walk through the forest,
a silent conversation with leaves,
with the brush of the wind,
filled with memories,
my heart dances among the branches.

Nature breathes,
in hues of green and blueâ€”
the sky, the mirador,
a gateway to the limitless mind,
a reflection of thought and solitude.

- Octavio Paz
