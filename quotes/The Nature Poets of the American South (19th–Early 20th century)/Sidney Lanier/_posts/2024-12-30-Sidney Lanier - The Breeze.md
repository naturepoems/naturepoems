The Breeze
O breeze so eager to enfold,
  With tender whispers on a sigh;
You dance through forests, promptly bold,
  And weave the songs where shadows lie.

The rustling leaves converse in play,
  With jovial voices rich—with cheer,
O, breeze, upon this summer day,
  Your laughter wraps the world so dear.

- Sidney Lanier
