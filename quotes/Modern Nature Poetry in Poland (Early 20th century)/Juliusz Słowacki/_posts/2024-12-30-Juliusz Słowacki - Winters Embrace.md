The winter's chill, so crisp and bright,
Wraps the earth in a blanket of white.
Silent whispers through the trees,
A sacred hush, nature's peace.

The world rests in a tranquil state,
Each star above a silent mate.
In the frosty air, time stands still,
As nature sighs, and the heart will fill.

For in the beauty of the snowy night,
Lies a promise of spring, a future bright.
The cycles turn, forever will,
In nature's grace, our souls are still.


- Juliusz Słowacki
