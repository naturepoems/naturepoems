The sea of life is wide and deep,  
With waves that lap our shore;  
They come and go in a restless heap,  
Their whispers thick with lore.

The sun that sinks in the evening glow  
Spills gold on the ocean’s crest,  
While the soft winds play and wild birds flow,  
In silence the heart finds rest.

O Love that rides on the fleeting wave,  
With all its joys and fears,  
Let not the sea a rift engrave,  
For peace within appears.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
