A Leaf from the Past  
A leaf flutters down from the sunlit tree,  
It whispers the things that the day will see,  
Forgiving the dreams of its wandering past,  
Flowing softly as clouds drift fast.  
Oh, I gather the shadows it bears with care,  
Ripe with the memories it longs to share;  
A leaf from the past is warmth in the chill,  
And the whisper of a life that beckons still.

- Alfred Noyes
