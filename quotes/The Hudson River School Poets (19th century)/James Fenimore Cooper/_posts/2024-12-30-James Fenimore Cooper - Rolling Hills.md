The hills that are rolling,
   Like waves on the sea,
With the meadows a-glimmer,
   They are calling to me.

As the sky paints a portrait,
   Of the day soft and long,
I am one with the moment,
   I am part of the song.

Let me wander forever,
   On this earth that is mine,
For the beauty of nature
   Is a treasure divine.

- James Fenimore Cooper
