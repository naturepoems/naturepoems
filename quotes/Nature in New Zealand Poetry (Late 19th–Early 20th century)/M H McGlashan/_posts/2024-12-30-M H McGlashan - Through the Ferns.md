Through the Ferns

Among the ferns, in shaded glens,
  Where mossy carpets lie,
The whispering breeze like old, dear friends
  Muses of days gone by.

The dappled light, the soft embrace
  Of leaf and bough above,
Invites us to a quiet space,
  Replete with nature’s love.

The insects hum a secret tune,
  The forest breathes a sigh;
As gentle as the rising moon
  That sails across the sky.

Here let me dwell, in love entwined,
  With every fragrant breath;
For in this haven warm and kind,
  I find the peace of death.
