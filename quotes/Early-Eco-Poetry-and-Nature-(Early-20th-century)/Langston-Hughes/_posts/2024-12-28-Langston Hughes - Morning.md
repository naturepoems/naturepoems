Morning

Sometimes when I sit and scratch the head of my dog
   And look at the awning of leaves,
   I feel a morning of a new day.
I listen to the soft rustle of the leaves
   And wonder what tales of the day
   Will have been spun in time for sunset.

I wait for the sun to blossom and the night to fall.

- Langston Hughes
