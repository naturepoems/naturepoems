A beautiful spot no longer seen,
A garden of perennial bloom,
Where sorrows dwindle, hopes grow green,
And flowers laugh away the gloom.

Under these arches of the trees,
With sunlight dancing on the ground,
The songbirds echo on the breeze,
And all the world of peace is found.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
