Gathering clouds were in the sky,
The trees were all a-roar:
And I, beneath that new reply,
Stood praise within the door.

The flowers were all a-leaning low,
The grass was thick and wet;
And all the glorious world below
Stood waiting for the yet.

In gloom and thunder round me hung,
While sorrow jumped with bliss;
I smiled till all the chorus sung—
I laughed till I could kiss.
