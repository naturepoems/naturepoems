The Evening

The sunset paints the evening sky,
With colors bold as hearts fall shy;
It whispers softly to the night,
As day concedes to nature’s rite.

In strokes of crimson, gold, and blue,
The world finds rest in twilight’s hue;
And dreams, like doves, begin to soar,
In gentle peace, forevermore.

- Richard Watson Gilder
