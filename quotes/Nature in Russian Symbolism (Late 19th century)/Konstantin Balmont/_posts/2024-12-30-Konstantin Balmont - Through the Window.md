The blue sky is at my window,
  The trees are sparkling like gems,
  And in the fields of happy daisies
  The wind sings its enchanting hymns.
  
  All the flowers break into laughter,
  The sun is bright and warm as day,
  And in the shade they spin in dances,
  The green leaves sway in sweet ballet.

- Konstantin Balmont
