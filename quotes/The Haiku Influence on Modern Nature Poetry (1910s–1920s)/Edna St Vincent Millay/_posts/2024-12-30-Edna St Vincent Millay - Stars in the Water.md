I see the stars that echo in the lake,
Reflections bright, a mirror to the night.
Forest whispers tell tales of the wide awake,
The air holds a language that needs no light.
Oh the silence carries thoughts, gently cocooned,
Words that drift softly through dark’s velvet bite.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
