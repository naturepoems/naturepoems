The brook flows through the meadow,
A ribbon, bright and free;
Its laughter brushes flower-blooms,
That dance so gracefully.

It knows the song of seasons,
In whispers soft and low,
While shimmering pebbles listen,
And hold the stories slow.

Here every stroke of sunlight,
Writes poetry in the air;
The secrets of the forest,
Are found in water’s fare.

So let the brook’s sweet journey,
Teach us to laugh and sigh,
For nature’s pulse and heartbeat
Weld word and thought to fly.

- David Garnett
