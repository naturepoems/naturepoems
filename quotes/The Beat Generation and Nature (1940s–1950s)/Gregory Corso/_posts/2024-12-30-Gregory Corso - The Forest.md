The Forest
by Gregory Corso

The forest is wild
like a child, though
I cannot approach it,
fearing its shadows
will take me, root me.

And yet, in its heart,
such wonder awakens:
a tree that leans
against a million
still lives,
that holds within,
a universe of colors,
 
how can I enter - there
is danger in the thick of it,
my thoughts will unravel,
my breath will lift, 
it will drown my reason,
a flood of leaf and branch,

sending me spiraling upwards,
whispering, between the light,
- I could lose my name
in the silent echoes,
A child again,
at peace with the chaos,
a humble wanderer
in the beauty of things.


- Gregory Corso
