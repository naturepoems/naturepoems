Autumn Song

O Autumn! thou art richly clad,
With leaves of gold and crimson hue;
In every rustle, I am glad,
For every moment brings anew.

The air is crisp, a cooling breath,
As sunbeams dance on fields of grain;
Where harvest sings of life and death,
In nature's cycle, sweet refrain.

I cherish thee, beloved time,
For in this season's waning light,
I feel the pulse, the perfect rhyme,
Of every day, both dark and bright.

- Thomas Woolner
