To a Young Beauty
O sweet everlasting, whose beauty is irremediable,
You shall not be hindered by sorrow nor by remorse;
But why must the head be ever troubled,
When that which dwells within is sweet?

Let the fetid and evil ghosts tumble,
Folded within their fallen paths,
When the morning scent of violets,
Comes with the light and echoes of laughter.

Sigh, when the waste calls you back via sinister call;
When ringing scents rage against the ballads.
Flee, I beseech there’s a place unchanging;
To where the swallows sing wailing verses for love.

- William Butler Yeats
