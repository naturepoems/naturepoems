The crystal lake reflects the heavens,
  A mirror of the skies so deep,
  Where every ripple tells a story,
  And nature's heart is fast asleep.
  
  The mountains guard the silent waters,
  The trees lean gently to confide,
  In every breath, a world of wonder,
  In every glance, our hearts abide.

- Konstantin Balmont
