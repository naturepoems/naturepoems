To a Dancing Bee
O, bumbling little fellow,
Listen to the flowers speak—  
Send your golden honey
To all the world in winged delight!  
Secret paths in fragrant air  
Teach you joy with each new flight.

On dewy dusk
Will you rest your weary head  
In a curling petal,  
Tucking sleepy wings  
Under your love?
