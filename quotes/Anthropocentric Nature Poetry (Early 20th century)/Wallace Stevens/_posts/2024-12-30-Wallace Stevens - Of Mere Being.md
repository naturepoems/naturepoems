Of Mere Being

The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space,
Like a tree made of glass.

The palm stands on a barren hill,
And its orb of blue
Falls limpid in the distance.

The palm stands on the edge of space,
And here is nothing, nothing but
The original image of the palm,
The palm of the height,
The palm of the throne.
