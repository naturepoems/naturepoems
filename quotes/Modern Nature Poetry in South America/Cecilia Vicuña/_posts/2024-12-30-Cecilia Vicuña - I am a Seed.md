I am a seed,
a whispering seed
buried deep,
in the embrace of earth,
a promise of green,
waiting for warmth,
a growing urge,
a gradual awakening.

From shadow to light,
I will push with all my strength,
knowing that in my heart
lies the memory
of the rain, the sun,
the very salt of tears,
a vital connection.

I will rise, I will flourish!
I will become the leafy
breath of air, the soft
shadow of boughs,
the essence cradled
by the sky.

- Cecilia Vicuña
