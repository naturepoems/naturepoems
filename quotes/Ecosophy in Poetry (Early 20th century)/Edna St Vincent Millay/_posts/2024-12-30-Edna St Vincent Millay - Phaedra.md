Phaedra  
  -------- 
  O, never more  
  Will the dew of spring clothe the grasses,  
  Or, never more will the violets bloom—to die  
Under the frost of night.  
  I see the shadows falling,  
Beneath the deep gardens where I wander;  
I hear the whispers of the leaves,  
And the air is full of the coming of summer.  
  I have waited and I wait still  
Until the light can shine—  
What if the light is as vague as it always was?  
What shall I alter, save silence?  


- Edna St Vincent Millay
