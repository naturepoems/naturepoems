The Night Sky
Beneath the silent dome of night,
Stars twinkle like distant worlds,
Each a beacon of ancient light,
Casting dreams across the abyss,
In the vastness, we are small yet grand,
Threads of existence woven in dark,
Galaxies spinning in eternal dance,
And as the moon whispers softly,
A silver sigh in the darkness,
We are reminded,
Of the infinite wonders above,
Nature's poetry,
Written in the stars.


- Mario Carli
