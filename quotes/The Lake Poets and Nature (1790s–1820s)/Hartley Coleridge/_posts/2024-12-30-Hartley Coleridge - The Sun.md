The Sun

O mighty orb, whose rays of gold,  
Are scattered wide as they unfold;  
Thy chariot wheels are crowned with light,  
And day is kissed by thee, O bright.

The hills in amber hue are dressed,  
As shadows lengthen in the west;  
Thy laughter fills the air with cheer,  
While nature’s beauty sings sincere.

Awake, ye valleys! rise and sing,  
In endless praise to him we bring;  
For in thy warmth and glow we find,  
The sacred bond with all mankind.

- Hartley Coleridge
