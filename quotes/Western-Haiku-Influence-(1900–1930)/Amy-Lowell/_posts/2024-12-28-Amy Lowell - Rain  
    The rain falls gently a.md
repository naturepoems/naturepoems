quote: "Rain  
    The rain falls gently, a silver thread,  
    Weaving dreams into the ground.  
    Each drop a memory, softly bred,  
    Awakens life all around.  

    In puddles, the sky finds its face,  
    Reflecting clouds that drift by,  
    Nature’s tears in a tender embrace,  
    Telling the world how to sigh."

Rain  
    The rain falls gently, a silver thread,  
    Weaving dreams into the ground.  
    Each drop a memory, softly bred,  
    Awakens life all around.  

    In puddles, the sky finds its face,  
    Reflecting clouds that drift by,  
    Nature’s tears in a tender embrace,  
    Telling the world how to sigh.
