A light exists in spring
Not present on the year
At any other period —
When March is scarcely here.

A color stands abroad
On Solitary Fields —
That science cannot measure —
And names that it reveals.

But most are in the Mind —
And no man will deny
We are as wise as we —
At the same time — the summer night.

- Emily Dickinson
