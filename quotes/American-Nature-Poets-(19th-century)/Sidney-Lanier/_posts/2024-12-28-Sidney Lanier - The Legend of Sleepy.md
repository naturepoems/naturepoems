The Legend of Sleepy Hollow

By Sidney Lanier

I
A posy of colors float on the lake,
      Where the rushes and lilacs do grow,
A haven where every sorrow could break,
      As the river moves soft, like the flake of the snow.

II
So the mind will rest gold in the dusk,
      When the ripples dance in a sweet, bright sun.
And softly the dreams rock the beautiful husk
      Where the woods weave a song, and the glee is begun.

- Sidney Lanier
