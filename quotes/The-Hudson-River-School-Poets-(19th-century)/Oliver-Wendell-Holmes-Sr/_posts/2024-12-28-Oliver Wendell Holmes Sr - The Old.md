The Old Bridge

The old bridge over the river,
That murmurs the history's song,
Where the stones are the lips of silence,
And the grating of centuries long.

There lie the reeds from the meadows,
And grasses so high, so green,
While the shadows of nights fill the river
With memories lost, unseen.

Some children have danced through the arches,
With the echo of voice in song;
Mid whispers of faith in the breezes,
And the breeze has blown them along.

O, the old bridge over the river,
Where footsteps of silence abide,
May it hold in its arms forever
The dreams of our hearts and our pride!

- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr
