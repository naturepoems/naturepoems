To Lavinia
As the lone bird, who wanders
Through the fluttering fields of spring,
And, spreading wings adorned with light,
Can find no rest but o'er the hills
Rides softly in the morning air,
My heart feels joy far into night,
Where quiet peace and wisdom share
A glimpse of beauty to the fair.

Lavinia, thy thoughts are sung,
Rich as the violets in the wood,
That stain the air and send the tune
Of youth toward the only good.
Forever in thy essence shines
The circle round thy whispered name,
Embowered with the laughing boughs,
In every fulgent, still acclaim.

- Henry Vaughan
