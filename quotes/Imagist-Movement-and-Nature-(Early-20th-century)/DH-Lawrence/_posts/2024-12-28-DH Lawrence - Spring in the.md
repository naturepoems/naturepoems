Spring in the South
  
There is no such thing
As a far-off spring.
It comes, rooted
In the fertile earth,
Among the fires of sun.

It blooms, spills forth,
Pink and white, green shoots
Sprouting over pastures,
And the air is full
Of new laughter, renewed life.

Come listen,
Feel the heartbeat,
As the world wakes up 
From winter's dream,
Into a new embrace.

                         - DH Lawrence
