Golden Dunes
In the golden dunes, where the sun kisses sand,
Mirages of dreams placed by an unseen hand.
Each grain holds a story, of time and of place,
In the vastness of beauty, we find our grace.

With the whispering winds that sculpt each curve,
The dunes rise and fall, with a gentle swerve.
In the heart of the desert, a quiet we seek,
Where nature’s soft whispers speak without speak.
