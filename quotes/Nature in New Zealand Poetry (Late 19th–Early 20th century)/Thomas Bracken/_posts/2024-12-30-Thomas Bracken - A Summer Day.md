A SUMMER DAY

The sun climbs high in a cloudless sky,
And the world is drenched in golden cheer;
The wind brings whispers and sweet replies,
As Nature sings, and the heart feels clear.

The flowers toss in the playful breeze,
Their colors painting the canvas wide;
While trees in concert sway with ease,
A symphony of the earth’s glad pride.

Small birds flit by with lively notes,
Their songs make music on every bough;
And as I breathe, my spirit floats,
On pathways of joy, in the here and now.

So, let this day unfold like a dream,
With every moment a treasure dear;
For life is a tapestry, a radiant theme,
Woven in love, under skies so clear.

- Thomas Bracken
