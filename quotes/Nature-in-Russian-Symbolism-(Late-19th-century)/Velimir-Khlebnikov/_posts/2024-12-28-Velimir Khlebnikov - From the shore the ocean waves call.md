From the shore, the ocean waves call,  
whispering secrets of the deep,  
where mysteries lie in the dark,  
a realm untouched by human grip.  

The tide ebbs and flows  
as if breathing  
with the heartbeat of the earth,  
each rise a sigh,  
each fall a retreat  
toward the edge of the unknown.

- Velimir Khlebnikov
