quote: "A single leaf drifts down,  
Caught in the breath of autumn,  
Beneath a gnarled oak,  
I ponder the cycle of life,  
How endings feed new beginnings."

A single leaf drifts down,  
Caught in the breath of autumn,  
Beneath a gnarled oak,  
I ponder the cycle of life,  
How endings feed new beginnings.
