HARBINGER

The sun, behind the red and purple rod,
   Lurks with the light of autumn’s breath,
And crickets croon, there, in the golden sod
   And preserve the whisper of my death.

I turn among the bushes green,
   And know each shadow as a friend;
The trees have cloaked me in between,
   Their mighty arms, as days will end.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
