quote: "In the morning mist,  
Wildflowers bend their heads,  
Awaiting the warmth  
Of sunlight,  
Their petals drinking  
Joy from the earth,  
A chorus of colors."

In the morning mist,  
Wildflowers bend their heads,  
Awaiting the warmth  
Of sunlight,  
Their petals drinking  
Joy from the earth,  
A chorus of colors.
