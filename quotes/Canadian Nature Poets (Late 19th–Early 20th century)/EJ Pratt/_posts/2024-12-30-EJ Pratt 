Autumn's Canvas

	Nature dons her vestments bright,  
	With strokes of crimson, gold, and brown;  
	In a wild, artistic dance,  
	She paints the world all around.  

	Frost lays its brush upon the earth,  
	Crisping leaves with chilly breath,  
	A masterpiece of fading light,  
	Embracing beauty, in death.
