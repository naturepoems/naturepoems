The mountains rise,
a sculpture
crafted by time,
majestic in
their silence.

Clouds hover close,
an embrace of mist,
while echoes of wind
whisper secrets
only the stones
understand.

In nature’s arms,
one feels small yet
delighted; as
life navigates the
crags and valleys,
a pure heart
beating in rhythm.
