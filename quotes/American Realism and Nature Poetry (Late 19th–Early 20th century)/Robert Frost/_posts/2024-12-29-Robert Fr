Right off the dark and shakes the night to tell
Of fears of both and fight, a tremor wide.
Oh stars upon the dark and strain to feed
By night may simply hold it back and break—

They caress my side to turn towards the day,
When all has gone within the folds of light,
I feel behind and burn with sprung of flame,
They come to seal their song each directs.

- Robert Frost
