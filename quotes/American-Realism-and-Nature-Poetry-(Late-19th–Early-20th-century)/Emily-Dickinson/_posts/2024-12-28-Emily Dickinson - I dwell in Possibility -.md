I dwell in Possibility -  
A fairer House than Prose -  
More numerous of Windows -  
Superior - for Doors -  

Of Chambers as the Cedars -  
Impregnable of Eye -  
And Doorway of the Discovery -  
Of Hopes and dreams to try -  

The Staging with a Cluster  
Of Rooms - and it is true -  
A longer Reach than there -  
Of Heights and Depth with Reply -  

And I would then be lured -  
By which a subtle Fish  
Draws backward in diety,  
The Sight's again its wish.

- Emily Dickinson
