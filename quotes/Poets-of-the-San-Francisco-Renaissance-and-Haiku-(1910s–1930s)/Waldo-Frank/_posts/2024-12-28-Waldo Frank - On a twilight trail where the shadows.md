quote: "On a twilight trail where the shadows creep, 
  Lingers the night as the mountains sleep. 
  The call of the owls signals the end, 
  And the stars emerge, like a lover’s friend."

On a twilight trail where the shadows creep, 
  Lingers the night as the mountains sleep. 
  The call of the owls signals the end, 
  And the stars emerge, like a lover’s friend.
