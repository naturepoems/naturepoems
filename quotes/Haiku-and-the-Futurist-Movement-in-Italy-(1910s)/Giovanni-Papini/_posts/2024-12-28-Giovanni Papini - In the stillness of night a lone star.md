Whispering dreams to the slumbering earth.
The wind dances softly, cradling the leaves,
While nature's breath gently stirs the heart's mirth."

In the stillness of night, a lone star flickers,
Whispering dreams to the slumbering earth.
The wind dances softly, cradling the leaves,
While nature's breath gently stirs the heart's mirth.
