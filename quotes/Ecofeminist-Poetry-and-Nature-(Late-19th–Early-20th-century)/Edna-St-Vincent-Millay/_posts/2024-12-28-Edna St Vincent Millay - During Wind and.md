During Wind and Rain

They that loved each other, in life’s fruitful years,  
And brought you joy amid thy driving fears,  
Tell me who you hold with, as it gently swells,
After the breath flies fast away from hells.  

They knew it, better, to soar above,  
The silly howling spirits, and clenching tree leaves;  
To feel the wind, so longing, rough, and swift—  
Settling softly: all lost between these evens.

So, here are they, forgotten in the night—  
And love is gone, remained as ghostly light.
