quote: "The moon hangs low, a silver coin,
In the sky’s vast pocket. Stars scatter,
Laughter of the cosmos—each twinkling,
A moment plucked from eternity's dance."

The moon hangs low, a silver coin,
In the sky’s vast pocket. Stars scatter,
Laughter of the cosmos—each twinkling,
A moment plucked from eternity's dance.
