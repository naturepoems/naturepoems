The river flows,
a silver ribbon, weaving through the land,
a journey of persistence,
each twist and turn,
a story told in water.

Fish dart beneath the surface,
holding onto secrets,
yet the river flows on,
as trees stand guard,
their roots clutching the bank,
like old friends, forever tied.

In the evening glow,
the water reflects
thousands of colors,
a conversation between earth and sky,
each ripple, each wave,
a whisper from the heart of nature.


- Alice Walker
