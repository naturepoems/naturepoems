The hush of the twilight falls softly like a sigh,  
Where shadows intertwine, the larks no longer fly;  
In the fading of light, a chorus of dreams,  
Painted in colors that dance with the beams.  

With the soft brush of evening, the world starts to fade,  
Each star a reflection of the love that we've made;  
In this moment of stillness, within Nature’s caress,  
I find the profound in the simple, the blessed.  

Let me breathe in the stillness, let me whisper a prayer,  
In the peaceful embrace of the night's gentle air;  
For in twilight’s soft folding, I gather the night,  
With Nature, my solace, my soul’s purest light.

- Marcel Proust
