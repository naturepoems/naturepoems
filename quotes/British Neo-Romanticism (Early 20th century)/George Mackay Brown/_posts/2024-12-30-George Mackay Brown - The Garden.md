The Garden

In the garden, life unfurls its colors,
Each petal a stroke on nature’s canvas,
From the brightest blooms of summer’s reign,
To the quiet strength of winter’s retreat,
Every season breathes a newreflection.

Bees hum, a busy orchestra of labor,
While the sun lifts the dew from leaves,
And in this haven, time slows its pace,
In conversations with the earth,
And the mysteries whispered in herb and flower.


- George Mackay Brown
