Frogs

A croak in the night  
reminds of waves unbound,  
droplets drip like shared fears,  
forgetting laughter of youth.  

In darkened ponds where dusk rings out,  
the croakers in succession rise;  
they piece together sweet dreams â€”  
yet among the heaving knots  
life unfolds, fraught with thorns.  

And though frolic echoes call  
from lilies adorned in dew,  
their song speaks of some truth:  
Holding fast the ties of hope.  

Those frogs sing for tomorrow  
where climb begins anew,  
a glimmer washed in time.  

Oh, sweet tremor of the heart,  
a sign of age unveiled.

- Gabriela Mistral
