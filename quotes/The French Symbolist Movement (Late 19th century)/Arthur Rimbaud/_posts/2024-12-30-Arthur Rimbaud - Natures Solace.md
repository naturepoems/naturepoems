Through the rustling leaves, the wind does sigh,
A melody sweet that the heart can feel;
In the shadows of trees, where the lost things lie,
Nature beckons with a promise to heal.

Each whispering branch tells a tale of old,
Of seasons changing, of love and loss;
In the silence of twilight, we share our souls,
In the sacred embrace where shadows cross.

So, letâ€™s breathe deep in this shelter of nature,
Find solace in the soft light of gloam;
For in this tender moment, we find our truth,
In the gentle arms of the earth, our home.

- Arthur Rimbaud
