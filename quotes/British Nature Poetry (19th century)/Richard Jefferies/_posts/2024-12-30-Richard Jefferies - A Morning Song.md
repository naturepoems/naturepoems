A Morning Song
Awake! The sun is climbing high,

The larks are singing in the sky,

The flowers, aglow, greet the day,

While dew-drops glisten in playful play.

With every breath, the earth feels new,

In every heart, a hope shines through,

Rejoice, for natureâ€™s song is sweet,

With every step, our lives complete.

- Richard Jefferies
