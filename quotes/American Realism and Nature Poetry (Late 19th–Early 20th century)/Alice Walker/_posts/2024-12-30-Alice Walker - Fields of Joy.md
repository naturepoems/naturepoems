Across the valleys,
fields of wildflowers sway,
a rainbow of colors,
a canvas drenched in sunlight,
where busy bees hum,
creating symphonies of existence.

I walk among them,
these delicate miracles,
each bloom carrying
stories inherited from the soil,
a legacy of grace and resilience.

Nature laughs,
exuberant and free,
as I breathe in the fragrance,
a reminder that joy is simple,
found in the swaying dance
of each petal, each leaf.


- Alice Walker
