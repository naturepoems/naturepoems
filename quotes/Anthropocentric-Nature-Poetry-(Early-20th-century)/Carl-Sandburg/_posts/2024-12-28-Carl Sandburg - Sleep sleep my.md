Sleep, sleep my darling,
it is the earth's lullaby,
the drowsy waves and hills
whole and sweet embrace.
The stars that guide the wind
will cradle you tonight,
for the moon has come to sing,
doorway behind dark leaves,
as the night wraps us in a shroud
and the grass thinks of the sun.

- Carl Sandburg
