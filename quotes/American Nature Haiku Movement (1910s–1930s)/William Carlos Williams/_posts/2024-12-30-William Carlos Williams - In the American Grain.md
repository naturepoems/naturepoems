In the American Grain
the mountain is a good
place to find
the perfect
a light
though only a shadow
will come before you.  

Breathe deep,
down to the roots
and climb up
through the pine to see
clouds creeping over
like shooting stars.
Turn your slow
mind to the weight of air,
touched by leaves,
and listen to your feet
ruffle light

- William Carlos Williams
