The Twilight Hour


  The molten air as it rises,  
  The masses of clouds that overhead pass  
  Are filled with their myriad surprises,  
  While the river rolls stupid — a glass —  
  Fearfully swaying at this — not far  
  The longing lest all light will cease  
  While our lips in the pleasantest hour,  
  Amid each bright placid tapestry seize.
