Candlelight Fireflies

As twilight drapes the earth,
Fireflies awaken from their dreams,
Tiny lanterns in the dark,
Casting their glowing beams.

They dance in joyful clusters,
A flicker of nature's art,
Each spark, a fleeting moment,
Etched softly in the heart.

Oh, to chase the fireflies,
Unravel the magic they weave,
In the arms of the night,
Where wonders never leave.

- Ossie Mthembu
