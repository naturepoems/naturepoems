Morning Dew

Awake, dear earth, to the dawn of glory,
As sunlight spills like nectar from above,
The world adorned in droplets, a story,
A canvas of dreams, of nature's love.

Each blade, a prism reflecting the morn,
With jewels of light in their gentle round,
Awakening life, memories reborn,
As whispers of hope in the air abound.

Flowers blush in their satin embrace,
Ready to greet the soft, warming skies;
Listen to the earthâ€™s intimate grace,
In the hush of morning where peace lies.

So let us rise, in this splendor, to dwell,
In the simple magic that nature provides,
For every drop tells a tale to tell,
Under the sun, where serenity resides.

- Albert Samain
