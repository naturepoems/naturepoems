A Summer's Day

A summer's day, the air is still;  
Over hills the conifers grow;  
Listen! the wild life calls me near,
Where the winds dance neat, and lilies flow.  
A swan goes winging through the brook.  
Time in the meadow freely sings,  
Here among the weathered stones,  
I feel the hush of nature's wings.  
Breath steady, I take in all of these  
Colors playing from the sky in hues,  
The afternoon ever warm and bright—  
Among the petals waking hues!

- Sarah Orne Jewett
