The Wind

Like a lion in the pride,
The breeze is shaking mighty oaks,
And weaving every veil aside
While dancing with the willow strokes.

Thus nature curls her emerald tendrils,
'Til bright the beauty opens wide;
With every sound and breath she bends,
Embracing summer's flowing tide.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
