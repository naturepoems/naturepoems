Forest's Embrace

In an emerald cathedral, silence deep,
The ancient trees their watch do keep,
With roots entwined, in earthy grace,
I find my truth in forest's embrace.

The dappled sun on ferns does play,
In shadows soft, where wild things sway,
Each breath a prayer, each moment still,
A sanctuary of the heart, my will.

- N Nu Maoridom
