Frost

The frost has painted the world anew,  
With a silver white that gleams  
And makes a wonder of all thatâ€™s true  
While the world lies still in dreams.  
Heart beating slow as I wander through  
In the stillness of the softly waking light,  
Where the day shall break anew.

- Edward Thomas
