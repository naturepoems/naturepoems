Nature's wonder swirls like snow,
Where moments pause and breathe,
To sift through colors, fade and flow
In silence find relief.

The sun spills warmth upon the earth,
And rapture takes up space,
Each bud and limb revived through mirth,
Each petal holds its grace.

Amid the trees, the breezes speak,
Of yesterdays and new,
In every whispered secret seek,
The skies of ever blue.

So when you wander ever near,
Each step, a prayer, a plea,
Embrace the dance that’s crystal clear,
And hear the heart of thee.

- Robert Frost
