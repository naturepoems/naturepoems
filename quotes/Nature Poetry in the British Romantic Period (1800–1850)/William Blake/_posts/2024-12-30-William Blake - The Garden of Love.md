The Garden of Love  

I went to the Garden of Love,  
And saw what I never had seen:  
A Chapel was built in the midst,  
Where I used to play on the green.  

And the gates of this Chapel were shut,  
And 'Thou shalt not' writ over the door;  
So I turned to the Garden of Love  
That so many sweet flowers bore.  

And I saw it was filled with graves,  
And tombstones where flowers should be;  
And priests in black gowns, who stood before  
And bind with briars my joys & desires.  

A garden lost; a place encumbered,  
A symbol of vain life doomed;  
To be chained within a flower's bounds,  
And be withered, forever entombed.

- William Blake
