The River
Downstream the river sings along,  
Its course unchained by manâ€™s intent,  
Through boughs of willows draped in song,  
Where nature's heart is still content.

We follow through the multi-tone,  
Where shadows ripple soft with light,  
And in this place we are not alone,  
As waters waltz both day and night.

Reflections of the world cascade,  
A dance of life, unseen, unfurled,  
In every bend where dreams are laid,  
The river sings its timeless world.
