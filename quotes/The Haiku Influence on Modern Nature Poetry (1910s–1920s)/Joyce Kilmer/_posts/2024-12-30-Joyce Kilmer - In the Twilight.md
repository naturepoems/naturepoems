The bluebird sings her sweet refrain  
That echoes through the glade;  
While rain drips softly from the leaves,  
In nature’s serenade.  

The brook, it laughs among the stones,  
And plays with all the trees;  
Their songs together in the dusk,  
Float on the gentle breeze.  

From woodland paths to fragrant lanes,  
In harmony they roll;  
While twilight dances on the plains —  
The spirit sings its goal.

- Joyce Kilmer
