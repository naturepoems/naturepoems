The Flowers of Evil

Nature is a sanctum of sweetness,
A bloom of secrets beyond lost grief,
Unleashing colors and whispers of promise,
Where hope beats in the chest of the leaf.

Yet amongst this arcane foliage,
Evil crouches in vile recesses,
An unsightly shadow writhed like madness,
That reviews beauty's grace in excesses.

And in the heart of an opulent flower,
Where perfume lightly envelopes like a kiss,
A haunting thought, a crawling hour,
Brings forth temptation from nature's bliss.


- Charles Baudelaire
