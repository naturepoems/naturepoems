The grasses all are damp and gray,  
The sunshine beams ahead;  
To colors boom through petals sway  
As flowers often shed.  

A sunless gap ought to be near,  
And whispers easily heard,  
For daylight wee as feelings clear,  
To pick an ash-hand word.  

And when the moon begins to rise,  
At soft daylight's retreat,  
Then beauty forms and blooms surprise,  
To seal the day’s repeat.
