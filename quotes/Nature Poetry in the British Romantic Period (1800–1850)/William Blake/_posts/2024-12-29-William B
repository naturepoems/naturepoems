Auguries of Innocence

To see a World in a Grain of Sand
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
And Eternity in an hour.

A Robin Redbreast in a cage
Puts all Heaven in a rage.
A dove house fill’d with doves and pigeons
Shudders Hell thro’ all its regions.

A soul’s delight should be  
For trampled flowers in the sea.
And a young grass-hopper, set free
Should peck, and croak, and leap, and shine—

Thus the gathering storm above
Brings together all we love.—
And a river doth break free,
Into the heart of the bird.

- William Blake
