Ode to the Great River flowing on,  
With gentle murmurings and deep reflections,  
You carve your path through ancient lands,  
Like a thought flowing from the heart of man.
  
Though the stones may tremble in your strength,  
You bear the songs of ages past,  
A timeless dance of water and earth,  
In your embrace, life blossoms at last.


- Friedrich Hölderlin
