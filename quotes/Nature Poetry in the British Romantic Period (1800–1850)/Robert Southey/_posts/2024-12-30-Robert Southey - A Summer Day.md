When azure skies with sunny gaze,
Bear down and bear me gently through,
Through flowery hedges, green maze,
Where scents of Nature sweetly strew.
The depth of each eternal Scene,
The weary heart, the loved one’s eye,
So tuned, finds nothing harsh, obscene,
But light and shade, the Onward cry.

-- Robert Southey, "A Summer Day"
