Birches
When I see birches bend to left and right
Across the lines of straighter, darker trees,
I like to think some boy's been swinging them.
But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.
As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
After a rain. They are twisted together
That is not the work of the boy, but of the tree itself,
Who has found a way to joyfully dance,
Dancing in the snow, boys inviting about—
Yet, no I mean just in that beauty, that child's pain—
To make their day, when wondrous trees
Have been bent to leave their dreams unfulfilled.

So I am glad for the evening and for the traces.
So we know that the child in nature does not always hide away
In nature's eyes, he still basks in sorrow
That should come back and find the child again,
Before every birch has found a way real.
Oh, that we could find such adventures,
To linger further up and there to listen.


- Robert Frost
