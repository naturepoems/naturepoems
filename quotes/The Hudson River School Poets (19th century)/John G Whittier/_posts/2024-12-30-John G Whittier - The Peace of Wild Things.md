The Peace of Wild Things

I come into the peace of wild things
Who do not tax their lives with forethought
Of grief.
I come into the presence of still water
And I feel above me the day-blind stars
Waiting with their light.
For a time
I rest in the grace of the world,
And am free.

- John G Whittier
