September on Jessore Road

A cold wind blows over our tender ground,
        reaches up past the palm trees,
            the sea water rushing in,
A wave of bursting life,
        stars shining down on us,
The moon reflecting on the pond,
   the rest of the world bathed in darkness.

I remember the grassy hill,
    a moment of quiet,
we gaze under the scattered trees,
         a sigh from the wings of life,
