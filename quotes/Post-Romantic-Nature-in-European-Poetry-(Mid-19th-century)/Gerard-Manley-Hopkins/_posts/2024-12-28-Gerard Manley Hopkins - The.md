The Windhover
To Christ our Lord

I caught this morning morning's minion, king-
    dom of daylight's dappled, dawn-dappled; 
    thrice, with a fierce, magnificent, 
    odorous, how he hung upon the air, 
    flew with a haughty, hapless grace, 
    in the chapel of the sky -- 
    I am all of that, and that of much mine own: 
    those be worse than fools that justly blame:
    so much power in such grace you cannot own.
    I know it was meant for the joy of the sky, 
    not for the praise of men. 
                     

                                                        -- Gerard Manley Hopkins, 1877
