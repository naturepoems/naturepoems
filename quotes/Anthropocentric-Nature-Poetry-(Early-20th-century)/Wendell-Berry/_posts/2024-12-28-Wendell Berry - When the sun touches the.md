When the sun touches the dawn,
   a splendor spins light
   across the entire meadow.
Each blade of grass awakens,
   each flower stands proud.
Being a part of this moment,
   I breathe in the wholeness,
   the symmetry of creation.

What does it mean to belong,
   to be held by the roots and wings
   of all that surrounds us?
   In every twig and leaf is story,
   in every bough a memory,
   and in this universe, we discover
   our own humble place,
   and realize we too must
   be nourished by this richness.


- Wendell Berry
