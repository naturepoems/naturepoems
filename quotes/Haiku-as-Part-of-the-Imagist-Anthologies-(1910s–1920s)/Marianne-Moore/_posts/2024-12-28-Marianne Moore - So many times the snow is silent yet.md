author: Marianne Moore
quote: "So many times the snow is silent, yet speaks. 
Underfoot the crunching crystal calls. 
Winter is a starry corridor; 
hint the fir boughs, hint the winds of song. 
With arms wide, breathe in the crystal star, 
you are a part of it."

So many times the snow is silent, yet speaks. 
Underfoot the crunching crystal calls. 
Winter is a starry corridor; 
hint the fir boughs, hint the winds of song. 
With arms wide, breathe in the crystal star, 
you are a part of it.

- Marianne Moore
