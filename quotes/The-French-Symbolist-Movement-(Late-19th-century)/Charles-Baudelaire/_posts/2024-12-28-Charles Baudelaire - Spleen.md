Spleen

When the fields are drenched with a heavy odor,
The skies sunk in a pall of leaden tones,
And when in death a breathless night implores me,
Oh, how I then wander, lost of calm outside my home!

The trees feel only with spiteful arms,
Shadowing the plains, necklace of sadness,
And the seasons pass, like gloomy armor,
Each red leaf falls on my heart like a scream!

The fog like a disease pulls my soul to his will,
In battles fought far away from a breach,
And the fog rolls in with its furious chill,
Swallowing the languid desires of my speech.

My dreams are the dirge of blasts, of abandoned winds,
That there plays no harmonies but the hapless shuddering.
A charnel house of colored hues invades my blink,
As flowers replace my visions after everything.


- Charles Baudelaire
