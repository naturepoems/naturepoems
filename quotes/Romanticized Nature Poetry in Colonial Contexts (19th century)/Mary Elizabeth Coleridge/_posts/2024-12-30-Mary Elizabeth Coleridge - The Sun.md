The Sun

O radiant Sun, with golden flare,
Your warmth ignites the nascent day,
With every beam, my heart laid bare,
As shadows dance in wild array.

You kiss the flowers, spark their bloom,
Awake the world from slumber's hold,
With light that sweeps away the gloom,
Each moment rich, each story told.

So let your golden heart ignite,
The dreams yet waiting to be spun,
For in your fiery, tender light,
We find the love thatâ€™s never done.


- Mary Elizabeth Coleridge
