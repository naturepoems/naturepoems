Sonnet of the Frost

In the heart of winter, silent and cold,
The frost paints the world with crystalline grace.
Each branch adorned in white, a hidden fold,
Where the sacred secrets of winter embrace.

With a breath of the dawn, the sun shall rise,
To melt away shadows with golden fire.
But for now, I stand, entranced by the guise
Of the icy beauty, my heart's desire.

Let the snowflakes fall and blanket the earth,
As nature whispers softly in flakes so bright.
In the quiet of this moment, I find my worth,
In the muted wonder of winterâ€™s white light.

- Pablo Neruda
