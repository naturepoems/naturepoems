The Old Oak Tree

Beneath the branches, wisdom stands,  
An old oak tree with open hands.  
Its gnarled roots, a story spun,  
Of seasons passed, of life begun.
  
Each leaf a page in nature’s book,  
In sunlight’s glow, take time to look.  
The sheltering arms, embrace from above,  
A testament to nature’s love.


- Halfred Lee
