Lines Written in Early Spring

I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sat reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And it was my own voice that cheered
The flowers beside the leaves.

And so I am, in the fair that makes us brave,
Remembering Nature's power—and I
Shall dwell within these woods, by meek and grave,
Forever to the stars and sky.

- William Wordsworth
