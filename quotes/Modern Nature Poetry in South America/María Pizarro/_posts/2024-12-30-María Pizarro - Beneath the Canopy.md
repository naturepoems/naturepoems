Beneath the Canopy

In the shaded heart of the world,
a hidden garden unfolds,
a sanctuary of emerald light,
a sanctuary for the restless.

Each petal, a letter written,
each branch an outstretched hand,
as sunlight dances through the leaves,
a performance only nature knows.

Here, I pause and breathe deep,
released from the weight of noise,
as the world softens its edges,
a moment suspended in grace.


- María Pizarro
