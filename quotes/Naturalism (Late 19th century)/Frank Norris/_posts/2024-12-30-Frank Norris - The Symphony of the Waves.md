The Symphony of the Waves  
Listen, the ocean sings, with a voice so profound,  
A symphony shaped in the ebb and the sound;  
The waves murmur secrets to the welcoming shore,  
In a rhythm eternal, forevermore.
 
Each crash and each lull brings a tale of its own,  
Of battles and calm, of the vastness alone;  
As the gulls cry above in a wild, carefree flight,  
And the dusk turns to dawn in the soft fading light.
 
The tides rise and fall, a dance finely tuned,  
In the heart of the ocean, where mysteries crooned;  
For in every wave lies a story so deep,  
As the sea calls our souls, in its solace we weep.

- Frank Norris
