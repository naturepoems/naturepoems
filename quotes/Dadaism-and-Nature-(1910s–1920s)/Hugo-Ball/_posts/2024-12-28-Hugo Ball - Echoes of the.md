Echoes of the Mountains

Majestic crowns of silence,
Kissed by snow and whispers,
Granite giants, rooted deep,
Where time conjures a bygone breath,
Each echo a tale of struggle,
In the cradle of eternity.

Clouds snuggle in slumber,
Wrapped in warm, tender sheets,
As wildflowers gracefully murmur,
The language of the winds,
Carving memories of ancient roads,
In the scriptorium of nature.


- Hugo Ball
