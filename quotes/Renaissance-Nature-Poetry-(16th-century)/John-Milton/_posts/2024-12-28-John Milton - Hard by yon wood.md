Hard by yon wood, 
in the slow-breathing evening, 
yonder the dusky vale and rivers murmur low,
As if they weave sweet melodies from leaves,
Pushing the shadows to where the gales softly roam,
Here Nature breathes her sigh, and tender whispers flow,
The lap of the earth, lulling us to her welcoming home.

- John Milton
