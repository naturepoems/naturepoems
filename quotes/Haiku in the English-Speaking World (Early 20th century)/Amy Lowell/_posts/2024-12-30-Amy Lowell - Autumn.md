Autumn

The autumn wakes with a shout,  
A wind blowing through the trees,  
Where crisp pebbles speak  
Of the colors that die,  
Where russet leaves drift,  
Over the drowsy, slumbering ground—
There is stillness in the air,  
And a single tear falls quietly, 
Like a moon’s spark shining down  
On this evening of leaves.

- Amy Lowell
