The Forest

Within the gnarled and ancient trees,
Where shadows cloak the twilight hues,
A scent of damp earth stirs with ease,
And whispers secrets, dark and true.

The sun breaks through the tangled leaves,
In shafts of gold upon the ground,
A delicate dance that never leaves,
And in this stillness, grace is found.

Each rustling creature, every note,
The song of life amid the shade,
In wild embrace, the heart ennotes,
As time and space begin to fade.


- Mary Webb
