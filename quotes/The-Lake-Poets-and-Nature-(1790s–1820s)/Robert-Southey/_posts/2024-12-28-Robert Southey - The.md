The Cloud
I am the Cloud, I'll drift and I'll flow,
With the winds that dance and the skies that glow;
Oh, soft as a whisper, I glide on my way,
Changing and shifting through night and day.

With rain on the horizon, I'll kiss the earth,
To nurture and grow all that's spring from its birth;
I cast my shadow, and create my dance,
With the sun in the sky, in a joyous romance.

So watch me move, with the rhythm of skies,
For I am the Cloud, born from nature’s sighs;
Of beauty and change, in forever's embrace,
In the fabric of dreams, I find my place.

- Robert Southey
