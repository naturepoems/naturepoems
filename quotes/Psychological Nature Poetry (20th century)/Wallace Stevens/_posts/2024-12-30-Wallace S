The Plain Sense of Things

The plain sense of things
is that I have the house.  
It is winter, I sit in the house,  
where amidst the trees—a painting so secure—
I breathe the distant sound.  

Time comes through the glass—  
And slowly the sound does fade into  
a presence untouchable.  
It becomes that instill of fear  
That death holds a beauty, all around.

You are in a world all glistening,  
That moves softly, a sigh of a breeze;  
And beauty flourishes it all as the moon,  
What still you stand at the heart to press.


- Wallace Stevens
