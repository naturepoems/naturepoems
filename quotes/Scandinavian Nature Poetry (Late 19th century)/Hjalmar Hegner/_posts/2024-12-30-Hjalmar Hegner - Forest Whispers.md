The dance of leaves, the droplet's fall,  
In every glance, a tale, a dream,  
The forest speaks, its voice a call,  
Where shadows flicker, sunlight beams.

I wander through this sacred place,  
Where silence sings and echoes flow,  
In natureâ€™s arms, I find my grace,  
In every breeze, my spirit grows.

- Hjalmar Hegner
