Behold the night, the stars so bright,
In every glimmer, hope takes flight;
The moonlight casts a silver glow,
A tranquil peace, a soft hello.

The air is filled with scents divine,
A serenade, a whispered line;
In nature’s arms, we softly rest,
With every beat, our hearts are blessed.

So lie beneath this vast expanse,
And let the night your spirit dance.
In every star, a wish to hold,
In nature’s embrace, our stories told.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
