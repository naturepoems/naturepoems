When the woods are full of song,  
And the winds do lightly throng,  
I sit beneath the silver trees,  
In the shade a breath like breeze;  
And I watch the sunbeams ply  
With the branches ’neath the sky,  
Each flickering light that falls,  
In nature’s sweet enthralls.

Here, my heart lays down its care,  
In the silence of the air;  
May I hold this peace divine,  
In my soul be love’s design.

- Sir Philip Sidney
