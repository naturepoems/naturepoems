A Narrow Fellow in the Grass  
Occasionally rides –  
You may have met him – did you not  
His notice sudden is –  

The grass divides as with a Comb,  
A spotted shaft is seen;  
And then it closes at your feet  
And opens further on –  

He likes a Grassy Bank  
To lie near by – He’s been  
Unnoticed, unseen by all  
And charged with every sin –  

But when a Snake is nigh,  
The one who runs is Me –  
Though he’s just a Narrow Fellow  
Yet, he’s monstrous to see –

- Emily Dickinson
