Dawn's First Light

A pale blush appears,
On the edge of the night,
With whispers of morning,
In the softening light.

The world stirs awake,
With each tender ray,
As the sun breaks the silence,
Of the dawn's gentle play.

Oh dawn, sweet dawn,
With your promise anew,
You open the day,
With a canvas of hue.

- John Thompson
