Nature is the artist, free and bright,
She paints with brush, but with heart and muse,
And blooms awake beneath her gentle light,
In colors grand, both vivid and diffuse.

Upon the rushing streams and mountains tall,
She weaves soft shadows, casts the brightest rays,
Yet all the while, through eons, Nature’s call,
Is one of peace, to which the heart obeys.

Wanderers through the valleys green and wide,
Lose self within her artistry and rhyme;
With every breeze that whispers through the tide,
We dance, as lovers, bathed in hope divine.


- William Wordsworth
