My Garden

In my garden green I seek,
  Where blossoms drift and play,
Between the vale and the peak,
  I wander day by day.

O fragrant breezes whisper low,
  A serenade they bring,
As life's symphony is glad to flow,
  With natureâ€™s gentle wing.

Among the blooms of every hue,
  To find sweet reason's fire,
From the rose to lark, every due,
  Is a peal, sweet desire.

- James Russell Lowell
