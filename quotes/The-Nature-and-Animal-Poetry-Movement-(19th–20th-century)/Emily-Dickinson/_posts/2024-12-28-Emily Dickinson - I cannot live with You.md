I cannot live with You —
It would be Life —
And Life is over there —
Behind the Shelf —

The Sexton keeps the Key to —
Putting up our life —
A Catacomb with Door —
And yet we cannot know —

How long it’s possible to be —
And this moment here —
We are but corpses — vanished —
Rich after less than once —

- Emily Dickinson
