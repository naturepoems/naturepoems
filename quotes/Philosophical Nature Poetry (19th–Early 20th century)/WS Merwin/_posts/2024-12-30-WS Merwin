The Forest

Deep within the heart of the forest,
Lies the pulse of the world,
Ancient trees entwined in harmony,
Where shadows hold their breath, silently.

Each leaf tells a story of its own,
Of rain, of sun, of forgotten dreams,
And as you tread softly,
You become part of that tale,
One with the whispers in the wind.

- WS Merwin
