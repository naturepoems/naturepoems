A Morning in the Woods
---

Awake with the dawn, all life anew,
In the quiet woods where the wild things grew,
The songbirds chirp a jubilant tune,
As daylight breaks, they gently croon.

Among the trees, I walk the trail,
Breathing the peace like a Holy Grail,
In every leaf, in every breeze,
I find my spirit's gentle ease.

---

Amidst the rustle, in shades of green,
I find tranquility, serene, unseen.


- Henry David Thoreau
