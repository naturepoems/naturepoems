In the dark of night, the forest glows,  
Fox fires dance, a flickering prose.  
The whispers of trees, the rustle of leaves,  
Cradle my soul, as the night weaves.

Wind in the branches, an ancient song,  
Natureâ€™s heartbeats where dreams belong.  
Under the vast sky, stars a-quiver,  
I find my peace by the silver river.

- Sigrid Undset
