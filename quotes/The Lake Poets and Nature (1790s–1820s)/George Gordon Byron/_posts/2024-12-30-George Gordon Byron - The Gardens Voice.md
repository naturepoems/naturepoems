In every petal, every bloom,
The scent of life is intertwined;
A tapestry where joys loom,
And every color redefined.

The garden plots where beauty grows,
Invite the mind to linger long;
In sunlight’s kiss and gentle flows,
Nature wraps us in a song.

So pause a while, take in the scene,
Where moments linger, softly glide;
For in this place, so lush and green,
Our hearts can rest and dreams abide!

- George Gordon Byron
