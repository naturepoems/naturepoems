The Moon
Erupting essence seeded,
like seraphs, the earth and water
rise from each layer in lightâ€™s filament;
remembering dark, as I cross the ether,
the busy tap of shadow-music gleaming.
So passes the blue-black veil,
checkering nights,
a circle escapes claim: nature only whispers
glimmers held in ceaseless night,
a bride laced in moon-skirts,
she holds all seeds wrapped tight.

- Mina Loy
