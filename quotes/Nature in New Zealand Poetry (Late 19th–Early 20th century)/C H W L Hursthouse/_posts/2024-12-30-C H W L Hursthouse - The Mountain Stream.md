The Mountain Stream

Oh, how the mountain stream doth race,
With joyful laughter, a wild embrace.
It tumbles down through rocks and roots,
A sparkling path in nature’s boots.

Its crystal waters dance and play,
Reflecting sunbeams on their way.
Each rush and ripple tells a tale,
Of ancient lands where spirits sail.

Seek ye the comfort of its song,
For in its flow, you can't go wrong.
In every splash and every gleam,
You find the heart of nature's dream.
