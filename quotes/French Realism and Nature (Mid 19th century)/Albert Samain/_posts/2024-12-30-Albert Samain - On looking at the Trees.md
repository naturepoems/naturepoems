On looking at the Trees

I am but the image of the tree
And no more than a flower in the grass;
The universe pours through my veins,
The sun spills forth its gold,
And I gaze without a thought,
At the space, the wind, and the clouds
That swirl about me in a swirl of joy.

The trees whisper my secrets,
Their shadows a balm in the heat.
I listen as stillness speaks to me,
Wrapped in the arms of verdant dreams.

In their embrace, I learn to be free,
Sprouting wings of quiet currents,
Framing me in the wide embrace of nature.

A hush envelopes my heart.
I am complete, at last, incomplete,
An echo of eternity, timeless as a breeze.

- Albert Samain
