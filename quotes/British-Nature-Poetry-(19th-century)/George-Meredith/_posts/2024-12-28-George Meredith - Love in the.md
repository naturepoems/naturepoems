Love in the Valley

    In the valley the sun kisses the flowers,
    And the stream flows softly by;
    The song of birds is heard for hours,
    And wild breezes sigh.

    Oh, love! how sweet the world can be,
    With beauty everywhere,
    Each moment blessed, we are so free
    In nature's loving care.

    The rustle of leaves in the trees above,
    The whispering wind's embrace
    All join to sing of the joy of love,
    In this enchanted place.

- George Meredith
