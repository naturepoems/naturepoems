The sun is a little lily
It is a little lily
And so it goes.

All the little birds, they sing
And all the little boats go sailing
And the rivers run with a little lilt.

He is as pretty as a little lily
And so it goes, and so it goes.

Let me be and let me see
What you find when you find me.

The sun is a little lily.

- Gertrude Stein
