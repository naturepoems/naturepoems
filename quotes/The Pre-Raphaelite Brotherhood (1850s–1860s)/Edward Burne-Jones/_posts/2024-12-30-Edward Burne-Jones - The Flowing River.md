The Flowing River
 
A river flows, a timeless stream,  
With whispers soft, it calls my name,  
Its gentle curves, a silver dream,  
In nature’s arms, a sacred flame.  

It dances on, through vale and glade,  
With stories shared in every bend,  
In flowing grace, my heart is laid,  
In nature’s love, there is no end.

- Edward Burne-Jones
