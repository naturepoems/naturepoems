Waves of the Sea

Dark lapping waves
On the rocky shores,
Tumbled to the rhythms
Of a lion's roar,
Dancing sighs of foam
Fill the air like soft voices,
The tide pulling back
Secrets of ancient choices.

Between the rocks,
Tangled weeds groan
With the burden of water—
The salty young trees
Listen in thirst
For a breeze, a chime;
Embrace of the sunlight,
In the depths we are born.

Oh, the waves have tales
In their bright glistening shells,
Each tide a wish,
For those who dare dwell,
The sea is buoyant and free.
You must only listen well.


- Richard Huelsenbeck
