In the heart of the forest, beneath
The gentle caress of autumn’s decay,
I stopped and watched the leaves,
Crimson and gold, lifted by the breeze,
Casting shadows across my solitary path.
Here in these woods, I regained faith—
In the worn shuffle of my footsteps,
In the unerring pulse of the endless trees,
And I knew the aching beauty of nature’s breath,
A reminder to seek solace between the layers of life,
A partnership, quietly vibrant and alive.

— "Autumn Song"
