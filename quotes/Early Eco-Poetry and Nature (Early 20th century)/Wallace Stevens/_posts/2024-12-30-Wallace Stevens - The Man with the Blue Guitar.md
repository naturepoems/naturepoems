THE MAN WITH THE BLUE GUITAR

So much depends
Upon
A blue guitar.

The man bends to this school
And to this grief, and to love
Of the instruments among
The bees and the oak trees.
He is lost in their circles.
He shivers on the border of love
As turned to beauty, alone in the trees.
The wild does not cover lovely music.

So much depends
Upon
A blue guitar.

- Wallace Stevens
