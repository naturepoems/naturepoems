To the Skylark
Up with me! up with me! up with me! 

My heart is dark, and all my thoughts arise;
My spirit grows languid—it is as if—
I gaze into thine eyes. 

Thou art the starry being, 
That bringeth forth the day:  
So lead my heart on high—  
Thou art the essence of sweet nature,  
For what could guide my way.

- William Wordsworth
