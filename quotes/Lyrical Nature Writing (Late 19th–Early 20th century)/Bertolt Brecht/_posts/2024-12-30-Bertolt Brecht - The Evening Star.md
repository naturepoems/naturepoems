The Evening Star

A solitary spark shines,
a gentle nudging, a soft glow,
in the twilight's embrace,
it beckons us forward.

Like dreams to the night,
it whispers of travels,
of endless rivers,
of skies beyond the clouds,
of hearts set free,
of journeys deep in silence,
of love shared with the universe,
of the earth's pulse,
forever feeling the weight of existence,
bound by an unseen thread.

So let us chase that light,
dance beneath its watch,
for in that moment,
we are timeless,
cradled in the arms of nature,
a part of the whole,
a precious world yet untouched.

- Bertolt Brecht
