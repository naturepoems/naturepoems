Evelyn Hope  
  
   (Excerpt)  
   
   I.  
   
     If I might see you  
     As you were then,  
     In the shade of trees,  
     Under soft leaves again,  
     Where the world brightens,  
     Beneath the sun's rays,  
     In whispers of evening's  
     Caring embraces,  
     I would lay beside  
     You, my dearest hope,  
     And there, breathe deep,  
     What the earth evokesâ€¦  

II.  
  
     To love while gardens bloom  
     Where the wild wind came,  
     And flowers bore their names  
     In scents entwined,  
     I would wait for the day.  



- Robert Browning
