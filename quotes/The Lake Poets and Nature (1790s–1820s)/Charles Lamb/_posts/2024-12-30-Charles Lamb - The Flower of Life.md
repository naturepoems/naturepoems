The Flower of Life

Nature paints her beauty bold,
In winter’s chill or summer’s gold,
From every petal, leaf, and stem,
To gentle hearts, she calls, amen.

A flower, bright or withering pale,
A reminder of the short-lived tale,
Yet beauty dwells in each embrace,
A fleeting touch, a sweet trace.

So cherish life as blossoms grow,
For petals fall, yet roots still show,
Though seasons change and time may wane,
Each bloom reflects the soul's refrain.
