The Mother

You tell me that you’re happy
And that I’ll be happier,
Grinning at my grief.
The day is dwindling down,
For love I have to brace.

Yet am I free to cast
Hands to life and gather land,
To my familiar sentence
Of wooly twins and farmer’s glee.

I think of all those ways
That nature crafts with mirror glasses,
The long-gone roots that swoon,
Among the forest pieces.


- Gwendolyn Brooks
