The Dance

Dancing under the stars,

while light fades slowly,

as dark descends upon the eyes,

sound and sound apart from place,

spun apart from what is known.

The movement finds individual lines,

rituals that uncover 

a rainbow’s edge underfoot

in the glistening night and gone.

The lost in limbs,

and not the wild that takes our breath,

Emotions come and go,

unmoored, made lovely, in the touch

of the earth beneath.


- WC Williams
