In the gleaming dawn, the flowers bloom,
Under the radiant sun, nature's loom.
Colors burst forth, a vivid parade,
In the embrace of light, shadows fade.

The songbirds trill, a symphony sweet,
Nature's orchestra, a rhythmic beat.
Whispers of wind through the rushes sway,
Each leaf a dancer in the light of day.

- Mariano Fortuny
