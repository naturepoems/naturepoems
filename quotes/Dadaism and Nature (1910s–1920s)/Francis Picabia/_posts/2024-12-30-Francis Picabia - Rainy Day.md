Rainy Day
Rain falling, falling
in a movement of its own;
the chimneys are puffing smoke,
the streets are lined with umbrellas,
a flicker of grey and green.

We admire the chaos
that lingers above the trees.
Everything is connected,
even the raindrops visit,
as they gather and tumble
into pools of reflection.

- Francis Picabia
