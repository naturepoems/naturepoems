Riding the River

I rode the river’s flowing grace,
  Where currents dance and sway;
Among the rushes, I found my place,
  And drifted on my way.

The banks were lined with flowering blooms,
  A rainbow on display;
And in the air, the soft perfume
  Guided my heart to play.

The winding path through twisted trees,
  A lover's gentle call;
The laughter of the leaves in breeze,
  The secrets to enthrall.

As ripples hummed their lilting song,
  I felt the world unwind;
For here, amid nature, I belong,  
  A solace, deep and kind.

So let me ride this river's run,
  With every twist and turn;
For in this water, life’s begun,
  And beauty, I shall learn.
