author: Ezra Pound
quote: "O wind, that blows through valleys deep,
With tales of lands both wild and free;
You whisper secrets through the trees,
And carry dreams across the sea.
In your embrace, we find our flight,
Awake beneath a quilt of night."

O wind, that blows through valleys deep,
With tales of lands both wild and free;
You whisper secrets through the trees,
And carry dreams across the sea.
In your embrace, we find our flight,
Awake beneath a quilt of night.
