Its sweet juice falls silently, 
A tender light bathes the night garden, 
And the leaves shimmer with delicate ecstasy."

The moon is a white fruit, hanging low in the sky, 
Its sweet juice falls silently, 
A tender light bathes the night garden, 
And the leaves shimmer with delicate ecstasy.

- Amy Lowell
