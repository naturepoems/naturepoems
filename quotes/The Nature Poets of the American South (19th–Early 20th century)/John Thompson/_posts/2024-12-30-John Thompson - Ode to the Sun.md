Ode to the Sun

O bright orb of day,
As you rise in splendor,
Your rays kiss the earth,
In a vibrant gesture.

Mountains feel your warmth,
Fields dance with delight,
You awaken the world,
With your golden light.

Oh, sun of the heavens,
Guide us with your flame,
In the heart of the forest,
All life knows your name.

- John Thompson
