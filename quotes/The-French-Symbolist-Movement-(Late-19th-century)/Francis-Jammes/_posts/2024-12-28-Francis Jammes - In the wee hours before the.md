In the wee hours before the dawn,
Where dew beads on the tender grass,
Birds tremble in sweet prelude, drawn,
To upturn natureâ€™s secret glass.

Each leaf, each bud now unfurling,
Reveals the pulse of life anew,
This greeting of beauty, softly swirling,
A promise held in morning's dew.

- Francis Jammes
