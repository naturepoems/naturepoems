Spring Awakens
From the slumber of winter,
Life stirs beneath the frost,
A tender shoot breaks ground,
Challenging the remnants of snow,
In vibrant hues,
Blooms burst forth,
And fill the air with fragrance,
A riot of color,
Nature's exuberance,
Her promise of warmth,
As birds return,
Their songs a chorus of renewal,
In the cradle of spring,
Hope is reborn,
And the earth sings,
A symphony of life.


- Mario Carli
