A pond reflects the fading light,
Inventing paths where swans take flight,
The ripple speaks of journeys near,
In every turn, the sky draws near.

The rushes bend, a soft salute,
As summer wanes and leaves take root,
In Natureâ€™s frame, all colors blend,
Her whispers echo, never end.

- John Betjeman
