The Crow | 1

    I

    I thought I heard it say, ‘I am lonely.’
    I looked round, and away in a corner of the sky
    A raven was tearing at some ragged fluff
    With a savage joy that made me feel cold.

    Something was odd behind the shaking pulses
    Of its wings.

    The clouds shamed their own faint embroidery
    They stretched long into the moonlight.  

    II

    Lust had made a fool of the air:
    It shivered in the cold ash of the sky.
    Was that not enough?  

    I heard it say again, ‘I am lonely.’
    But in its tune there was a hunger.
    Odd, for to a raven, cold ashes are nothing.  

    III

    It flew around, never leaving the ground,
    Felt the scratch of earth on its feathers,
    And basked in the wet sounds of the distance.
    The sounds filled my mind only with longing.  

    And so I thought, there’s nothing to do but die.
    I embraced what was left of my life, this soft longing
    Whatever it was I could see in the shy warmth of the earth,  

    IV

    Or whether I still heard it say, ‘I am lonely.’
    It flew off, a dark blur, blurred out into the shadows
    Where no shape could take shape.

    I was left digesting the echo of its scream.
    And I cannot describe where it was going,  

    But into the gathering dark beneath the loftiness of trees.
