In the lingering dusk,  
When the shadows gently creep,  
The stars prepare to rise,  
As the world drifts to sleep,  
And dreams entwine the waking soul.

With every sigh of night,  
Nature hums her sweet refrain,  
Reminding us, in this still flight,  
That there’s beauty in life’s pain,  
And in darkness, we find the light.


- George Ripley
