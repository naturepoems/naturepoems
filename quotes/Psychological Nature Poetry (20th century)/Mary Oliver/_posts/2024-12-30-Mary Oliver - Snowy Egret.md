Snowy Egret

The snowy egret  
stands still,  
its long neck bent  
in a pose of perfect grace,  
its yellow feet  
plunging into the water,  
a dancer in a bare room,  
its head a regal piece of white,  
its crown untouched.  
And when it rises up,  
it is the miracle of flight,  
a dream meeting the sea,  
coming back downâ€”  
into the soft, white  
of the sandy shore.

- Mary Oliver
