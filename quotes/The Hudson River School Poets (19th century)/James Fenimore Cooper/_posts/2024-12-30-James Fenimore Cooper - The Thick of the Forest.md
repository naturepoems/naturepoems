In the thick of the forest,
   Where the sunlight does paint,
And the murmurs of nature
   Speak softly and faint.

With the brooks that are laughing,
   And the leaves that do dance,
There's a magic in stillness,
   That invites us to chance.

Let me find my own spirit,
   In the rustle and sway,
For the heart finds its rhythm
   On this wondrous pathway.

- James Fenimore Cooper
