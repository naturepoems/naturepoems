As if the Cedar were,  
Returned to the Sea –  
So did thy Life unto  
The Region of the dry.  

But from the Sentinels of Earth –  
A Mist as sweat – manifested –  
Until your Beauty vanished!  

And Name – gone from the company  
That lasted years on years to me  
Withdraw the infinite Return  
Essence from The Bow and She!  


- Emily Dickinson
