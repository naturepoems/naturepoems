Under the stars, the night begins,
With whispers soft, where stillness spins,
Each twinkling light, a story old,
In the fabric of the cosmos told.

The moon, a lantern in the sky,
Reveals the truth, and bids us fly,
To sacred realms of endless grace,
In nature’s vast and warm embrace.


- Roger Fry
