The Grass divides as with a Comb –  
A spotted Cow – goes down that way;  
And scolding – yet knows better –  
That someday – it will have its Day –  

The Wind blew me – in Mary’s Hair  
With absent winds – it drifts away  
But Nature’s Hand – is on it –  
And all will be – as far away –

- Emily Dickinson
