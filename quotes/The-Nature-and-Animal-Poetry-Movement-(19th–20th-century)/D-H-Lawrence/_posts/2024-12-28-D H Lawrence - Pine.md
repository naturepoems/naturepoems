Pine Trees

We stand here under the silent pines,
Like whispered prayers before the dawn,
The forest timeless, while the world aligns,
Around the circle softly drawn.

These giants hold the night above,
With arms of green and darkened grace,
In their shadows, there stirs the love,
Of nature’s heart, in gentle embrace.

Their songs are the memories of ages,
The breeze that weathered all the storms,
Within their presence, history engages,
A testament of life’s true forms.
