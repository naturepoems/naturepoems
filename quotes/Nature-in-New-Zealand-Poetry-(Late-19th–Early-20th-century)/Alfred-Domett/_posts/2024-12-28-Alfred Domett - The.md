The Sea

The sea has a song for the chosen few,
    A song of the waves that vary,
It calls to the heart of the world anew,
    As it blends with the breezes airy.
The foam, like white flowers on a green blue hill,
    Is the laughter of love all day,
And the music that lingers, and makes us thrill,
    In the echoes of ocean's play.


- Alfred Domett
