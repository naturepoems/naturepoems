In the Wood
When evening's shadows softly fall,
  And stillness breathes across the leaves,
An echo rises like a call,
  From the green earth my spirit heaves.
Ah, wood, if I might wander free,
  Forever lost in every way,
The night's sweet dreams would cover me,
  Forever in thy woods of sway!

With harm, thy high embattlements do crape
  My wandering tears across the stars;
Yet, with a breath, a silken shape
  Comes whispering through the golden bars.
From shady nooks the perfume springs,
  And summer nights in mem'ry bring
A silver voice that softly sings,
  What joys my heart can ever glean!

- Philip Bourke Marston
