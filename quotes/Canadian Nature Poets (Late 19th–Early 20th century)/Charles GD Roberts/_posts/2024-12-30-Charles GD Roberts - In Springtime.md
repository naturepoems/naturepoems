In Springtime

When the lark begins to sing  
  In the arms of morning light,  
And the dew drops glisten bright  
  In the tender heart of night,  
I feel the freshness in the air,  
  The promise of the day,  
That dances on the mountain high,  
  And whispers all the way.

The trees don cloaks of emerald green,  
  And flowers wake in bloom,  
While the brooklet sings a sweet refrain,  
  And echoes fill the room.  
O vibrant world, of mirth and cheer,  
  You keep the heart in tune,  
With life and labor endlessly sound,  
  As softly falls the noon.

So let me breathe your fragrance deep,  
  And let your colors flare,  
For in this springtime's sacred time,  
  The heart can find its care,  
And with each leaf that breaks the earth,  
  New hope is born anew,  
In the serenade of vernal bliss  
  Where life draws ever true.

- Charles GD Roberts
