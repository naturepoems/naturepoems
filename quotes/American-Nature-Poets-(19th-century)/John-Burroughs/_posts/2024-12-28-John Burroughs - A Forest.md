A Forest Hymn

The groves were God’s first temples; ere man
   Learned of the sun to worship, there
   The rude and simple worshiper
   Came, with the primal instinct that he can,
   Feel the bright glories shining everywhere.
   And all his thoughts go forth to spirit vast,
   And dimly through the space of boundless air
   Climb up the turrets of celestial truth.

   Many a lowly altar might have passed,
   Unseen by man, but the great stones and the earth
   Shout honesty and praise of lofty worth.
   The green moss bears the daisy’s soft-winged birth,
   While every wind that whispers through the trees,
   Sounds the glad chorus of the leaf-advancing spring.

- John Burroughs
