Springtime Affair

The springtime whispers,
Each flower sprouting songs,
Fragrant melodies,
Where the lovers throng.
What a time to breathe—
Dance of the blossom,
Sown brightly beneath
The warm sun’s glimmer.

The world is young
In a riot of color,
Birds return singing
Their notes ever clearer.
Bees hum in delight,
Stirring nectar’s flights,
Nature’s fresh palette,
A playful delight.

Beauty, oh beauty,
In the sunlight’s embrace,
Each blade of grass
Is a song, a grace.
The heartbeat of spring
Echoes far and near,
A vibrant affair,
For all who draw near.


- Richard Huelsenbeck
