Harlem

What happens to a dream deferred?
   Does it dry up
   like a raisin in the sun?
   Or fester like a sore—
   And then run?
   Does it stink like rotten meat?
   Or crust and sugar over—
   like a syrupy sweet?
   Maybe it just sags
   like a heavy load.
   Or does it explode?

- Langston Hughes
