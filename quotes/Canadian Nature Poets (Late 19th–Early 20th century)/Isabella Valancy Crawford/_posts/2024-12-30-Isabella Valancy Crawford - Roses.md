Roses

In my little garden there are roses,
  Flowers red, and white, and gold;
Softly they lean with the breezes’ poses,
  Their secrets yearning to be told.

In their sweetened perfume I fly,
  As a bee seeks a blossom bright;
The sun blooms her rays from on high,
  To bless the flowers before daylight!

- Isabella Valancy Crawford
