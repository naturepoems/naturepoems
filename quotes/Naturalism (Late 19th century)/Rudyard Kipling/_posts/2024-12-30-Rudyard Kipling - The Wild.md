The Wild

Oh, breathe, my soul, the wild,
In the forest, the endless green —
Let it ripple deep, through laughter and tears,
Where the echoes supervene!

The dance of the wolves through the moonlit night —   
The flight of the deer unseen,
The playful call of birds alight,
And the river flows with a sheen.

Nature leads us to wonders,  
In her cloak of endless song,
Her beauty heals the broken heart —  
Let we not, from her path, go wrong!

- Rudyard Kipling
