Spleen 1

When the sky is weeping, the earth sighs,  
And I feel a dreary heaviness in the air,  
Each drop of rain arranges a rhythmic dance  
That stings my soul like a thousand needles.

Am I not, like the moon, an abandoned child?  
I moan, my heart enshrined in a dark chamber;  
An opaque cloud stifles the sweet smell of blossoms,  
While shadows lurk in the corners of my mind.

This melancholy spoils my love for life,  
I seek but find no gentle touch of light,  
Only the bitter chill of isolation,  
In a world that teases with whispers of spring.

- Charles Baudelaire
