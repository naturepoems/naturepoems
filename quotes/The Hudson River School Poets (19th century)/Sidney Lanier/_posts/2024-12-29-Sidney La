The Symphony

I am the Voice of the Spirit,
Who, both in Fire and in Water,
Awakens in man delight;
Nurturing and nursing,
With intrepid breath,
Ears, darting, eyes, dimly peering, and unseeing.

I sing in the Light,
In the blue of the sky,
In the deeps of the sea;
I sing in the Silence,
For I know you are listening.
Ah! This is the truth, my peers:
A major chord transcending all,
Complex and spiritual and bold.

I am ecstatic, light, longing,
Winding across heavier stones
In a luscious, pleasant stillness,
For who cannot hear my depth only,
But who seeks for harmony and for grace,
And in jubilant music, drown their pain!

I sing in the golden trees,
In the meadow’s soft weave,
In dreams unseen, cool dew in the morn,
Ah! Let the earth breathe beauty,
As all may rise and hear me singing,
With a life, a love encompassing all!

And music returns.

A Ballad of Trees and the Sky

The trees they grow so high,
The sky it is so blue;
I sing to the trees and the sky,
My heart lost in the hue.

The leaves like my thoughts are bright,
The sun on them a golden weave;
The winds they speak at night,
Whispering tales, as if to grieve.

The boughs dance free and wild,
As laughter weaves through their form;
And in their shade love has smiled,
Where life blooms bright and warm.

On earth that shall forever bend,
With roots deep strong and bold;
Let my songs to them ascend,
For in their arms I behold.

The Marshes of Glynn

In the marshes of Glynn, where the waters fall,
With stretches of reeds and a languid call;
The sky curls low with its golden light,
And the path of the sun bends from morning to night.

The winds they head in a gentle embrace,
As echoes of nature unveil their grace;
A hare bounds forth in a jubilant dance,
While insects gather in time’s fading trance.

To the pulse of the river, soft-stirring life,
Is a world shrouded deep in tranquil strife;
And there in the silence, in fields stretched wide,
A heart beats steady, with nature as guide.

The Song of the Chattahoochee

Out of the hills of habit,
Down to the plains of thought,
The creeks and springs and rivulets,
To the river's curve and caught.

Eager, they gather, eager and bold,
Slides through valleys, dark and cold;
With inviting coasts, where the waters flow,
Where concerns and burdens cease to glow.

The waltzing wildflowers tremble and sway,
As a song of the Chattahoochee plays;
In the light of dawn, with shadows to greet,
Life entwines deep within it, sweet.

Shakespeare and Nature

O, how oft have I strayed, where the brook bends, cool,
In the playful cackle which doth lay rule;
Across the soft carpet of nature's sweet saw,
To muse upon freedom, high, pure as the law.

For deep in the woods, where wildflowers grow,
In delicate brush the minutes run slow;
Yet with hearts and souls that yearn for the sun,
We find peace in quiet where the wild things run.

---

From the Forests

When the winds are calling loudly,
In the forest’s verdant glow,
With leaves that whisper secrets,
The heartbeats shared, we know.

Where ancient trees stand rooted,
With strength through the years so bold,
They weave tales of the daylight,
Of treasures long gone, retold.

Let me wander in these places,
Dancing with a life so true;
For amid the trees' embrace,
Is a spirit ever new.

---

Sunset

The glow of the sunset clad the sky,
As fire ignites the depths of twilight,
With hues of crimson and warm alibis,
Softly fading out of sight.

Across the hills where shadows play,
The lull of the night draws near;
As the golden blaze gives way,
To the canvas of stars, pristine and clear.

---

The Waterfall

In the woods of each high mountain slope,
Where depths impart their glee;
With tall trees ever reaching upward,
In the waterfall’s embrace I see.

Rushing echoes swirl around,
In cascades, sweet and wild;
As splashes set the tone profound,
With life renewed and reconciled.

---

An Ode to the River

O gentle river, flowing so grand,
With silken shades and glory,
Catching the hues of the forests green,
And weaving life’s endless story.

Within you lay the song of the earth,
In time’s own flowing breath,
Whispering tales of laughter, love,
Through the fading pulse of Death.

---

The Dawn

A soft, awakening sun breaks morn,
Bringing warmth and whispers fair;
Through the veils of evening's gentle scorn,
On sweet aromas, we declare.

With dew upon the grass that glows,
And shadows slowly shifting away,
A symphony of color flows,
As nature bids farewell to day.

---

Autumn

When leaves drop their hues from high,
To skies dressed warm in plainest grace;
As autumn looks with a sigh,
Giving life a delicate, cooling embrace.

In moments, let reflections dwell,
For time turns on, with beauty veiled;
Each bead of loss a splendid spell,
A symphony played, its notes unveiled.

---

Let the Spirit Breathe

I fling my hands towards skies so wide,
Draw upon nature, love, a great tide;
To feel the breath of the world alive,
Where all that blooms and grows shall thrive!

In the whispering trees, I find my peace,
As earth reveals a sacred lease;
Encircle my heart, let nature aspire,
In cascades and clouds, I rise higher!

---

Evening Prayer

As day recedes into the night,
With starry realms afield in flight,
Call me to your bosom, dear,
Where nature wraps her arms so near!

---

Moonlight on the Sea

Where waves embrace the sultry shore,
Under a tranquil moon’s soft light;
Each gentle ripple, a calming lore,
With silver threads that weave through night!

Let the darkness cradle all that seems,
As beauty sleeps in soft repose;
In moonlight’s glow, life’s sweetest dreams
Awake to love where serenity flows.
