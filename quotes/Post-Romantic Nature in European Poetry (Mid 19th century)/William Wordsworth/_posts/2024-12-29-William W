She was a phantom of delight,
When first she gleamed upon my sight;
A lovely apparition, sent
To be a moment’s ornament;
   Her eyes as stars of Twilight fair;
Like Twilight’s, too, her dusky hair;
   But all things else about her drawn
   From the mind of a poet, fair or fawn—
Although I said in vain, ‘Be still!’’
Upon this fountain ledge of stone,
With silvery shoes, she sought the lone
   Wild flowers of the meadow’s crown,
   About their cups in starlit night,
To mirror in life the smiling light.

With gladest smiles, she moved along;
I felt the impulse of her song:
And every bush and fence thereupon
Was painted whitest flowers drawn.

With joy I saw her still advance,
Yet lingered long, with half a glance,
Till bending low to laugh aloud
Her robes fell into the flowered ground,
   And circling leaves flew there,
   All acted out in air.
And then she turned to a glance,
**While holding back because I knew,
And feeling through and through,**
And starred in all her glories bold,
Awake with nature as a whole.

- William Wordsworth
