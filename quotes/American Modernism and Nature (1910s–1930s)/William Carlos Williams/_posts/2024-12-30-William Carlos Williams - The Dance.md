The Dance  

A man giveth a willow  
In an ivory dress  
He goeth round the face  
Of her like a  
Green moon of heaven  
He danceth  
For she is  
The willow of the dusk  

Long willow’s shape  

In the light of the setting sun.

And bright as the ring  
Of twilight  
She giveth beauty  

Color through the wooded light.

- William Carlos Williams
