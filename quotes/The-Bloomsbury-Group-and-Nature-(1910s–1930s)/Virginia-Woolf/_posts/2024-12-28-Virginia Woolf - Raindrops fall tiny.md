Raindrops fall, tiny diamonds,
  Glittering in the morning sun;
  They catch the light in playful mirth,
  A symphony from the edge of leaves.
  I linger here, where magic weaves,
  Time stands still, and all is peace,
  In nature’s embrace, my heart believes,
  That life is simple, sweet, and whole.

  - from "Raindrop Serenade" (1930)

- Virginia Woolf
