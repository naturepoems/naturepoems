Among The Mowers

Come, behold where I do stand,
     See where the daisies make the green expanse,
Kissing their sweet grounds to hold command,
     A dance amid the colours in their chance.
Let nature’s finest gift unfold
     A world of blooming hues that sway
And tell the riches, gently told,
     In whispers drawn through summer’s day.

- William Browne
