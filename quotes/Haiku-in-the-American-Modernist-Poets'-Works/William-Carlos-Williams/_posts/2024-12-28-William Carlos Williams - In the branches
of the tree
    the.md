quote: "In the branches
of the tree
    the stark figures
    loosen and sway
whispers of leaves,
    the droplets of rain.

               Nature speaks in silence."

In the branches
of the tree
    the stark figures
    loosen and sway
whispers of leaves,
    the droplets of rain.

               Nature speaks in silence.

- William Carlos Williams
