The winter's chill, a quiet shroud,
As nature sleeps, her breath held tight,
Yet underneath the frozen crowd,
Lies the promise of coming light.

In layers dark, the earth prepares,
For blooms to break through softening airs,
In every frost, a tale unfolds,
Of strength renewed, of life retold.

- Duncan Grant
