Spring Song
The warm sun is shining,
The birds sweetly sing,
The dearest of all things,
To me is the spring.

When all things awaken,
When nature is bright,
Oh, I am the happiest,
In the spring’s sweet light.

Such sweetness in my heart,
So tender in my soul,
I wish to remain forever,
In spring’s sweet control.

- Langston Hughes
