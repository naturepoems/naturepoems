Wind

Breath of my life, O wind,
What brings you rushing here?
You shake the trembling leaves,
You toss my heart in fear.

In the open road you wander,
The wilds you make your own,
I feel your fierce embrace,
Even in the solitude of stone.

You carry the echoes of my thoughts,
As through the trees you weep,
O restless force of nature,
This song, you ever keep.
