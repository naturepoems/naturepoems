The Poem
     I had the sound
in my head,
     the wind stirring
        trees beyond the fence
and grasses kneeling
    on their knees,
     sliding across
          brown stones,
                the poem.
     Perhaps it was the ocean
that came behind me,
because I was there,
     with the sound
              of fragrance
of peonies and daylilies
    in autumn light,
     the way it sways,
flows,
    as the poem
falls around,
    slipping through
      each hand’s grasp.

— Frank O’Hara
