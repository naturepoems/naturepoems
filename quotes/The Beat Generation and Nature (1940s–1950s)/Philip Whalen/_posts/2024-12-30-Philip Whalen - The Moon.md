The Moon

My wife
and I
looked out
at the moon
last night

and decided
to spend the rest
of our lives
watching it.  

What more
could one want?

We are
not demanding,
but ask,
if there is
anybody out there
who wishes to
join us
on our late night
sky-watching
excursions.

It is a
beautiful thing
—The moon.

Philip Whalen
