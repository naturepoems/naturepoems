Landscape with the Fall of Icarus

In the fall of Icarus,
The real is the color of blue.
Now the grass is dappled and alive
And the sweet scent of motion is silent;

The ship is sailing towards the sun,
And where the stillness grows is Icarus.
In this, our hidden love, hidden grass
And our close confines caught and tangled.

But not the warning of the fog.
And when this beauty becomes too stark,
It is all there cannot be.
The mountains breathe their air.

Here the green ground since it is new,
And the salt meer changes its gradient
Where it was once a fault
And grows alive beyond our glances.



- Wallace Stevens
