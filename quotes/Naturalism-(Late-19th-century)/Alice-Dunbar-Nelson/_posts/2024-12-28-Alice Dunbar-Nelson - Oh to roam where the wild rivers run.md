Oh, to roam where the wild rivers run,  

And the hills kiss the skies in serene harmony.  

With the touch of the sun, I am woven with none,  

In the fabric of nature, my spirit is free.


Birds flit in the branches, their laughter so clear,  

As I pause in the stillness, a whispering breeze,  

In this land of sweet wonders, I shed every fear,  

In the heart of the wilderness, my heart finds its ease.

- Alice Dunbar-Nelson
