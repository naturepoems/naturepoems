A morning mist drapes over the land,
Like a gentle veil, it touches the sand.
As breath of life awakens anew,
Each petal gleams with a dewy hue.

The calls of the birds ring clear and sweet,
As their melodies soar, we harness their beat.
Through valleys lush, in forests dense,
Nature unfolds her divine presence.

From the whisper of pines to rivers that glide,
In this tapestry woven, I long to abide.
So let me roam, where the wild things tread,
In the beauty of nature, my heart shall be led.
— John Clare
