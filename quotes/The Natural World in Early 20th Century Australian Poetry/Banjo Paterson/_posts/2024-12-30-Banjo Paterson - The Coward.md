The Coward

An odd-cast star on the seas of light,
A kind there from the edge of the stone;
To harker when he needs is fright,
And by day drenched in silence alone.

Oh heavy as iron, in shackles bound!
What a mean disgrace that life, so slight,
And seeing sun, you cry sound,
But always bind and never reach the light.

But when the winds of courage blow,
Beneath fear and under shadowed skies —
Break the night skies that never glow,
And shatter chance to unfurl your cries!

So lift your heart to where the voices roam —
And when the dawn breaks, don’t stay away!
At one for spirit, heart is home,
For by the courage, hold truth day by day.

- Banjo Paterson
