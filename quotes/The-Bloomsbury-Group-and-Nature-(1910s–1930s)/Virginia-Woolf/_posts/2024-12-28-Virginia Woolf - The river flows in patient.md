The river flows in patient grace,
  An endless passage through time,
  It carries the laughter of children,
  The sorrows of days gone by.
  I sit by its banks, a witness,
  As it weaves through the heart of the land,
  Each ripple a reminder of life’s flow,
  In its currents, I find my own reflection.

  - from "Rivers of Time" (1918)

- Virginia Woolf
