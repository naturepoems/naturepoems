Upon the hill, where shadows dance,
   The daisies crown the grassy mound;
With every bloom, a fleeting chance,
   To feel the joy of life abound.

The bees hum softly, weaving dreams,
   As nature’s pulse begins to beat;
In sunny meadows, light redeems,
   Each fleeting moment, pure and sweet.


- L M T Aitken
