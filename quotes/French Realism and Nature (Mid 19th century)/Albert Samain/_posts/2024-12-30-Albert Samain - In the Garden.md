In the Garden

Among the vines and blooming flowers,
I find my solace, a sacred retreat,
As the sun hands time the afternoon hours,
The garden unfolds, a fragrant seat.

Petals flutter like butterfly wings,
Colors mingle in the softly lit glow,
Where silence wraps like music it sings,
A moment reserved where stillness grows.

Here is peace in the gentle sway,
In whispers that dance with the breeze so light,
Every fragrance, a thought to convey,
A love letter written in colors bright.

So let me linger in this embrace,
Where the world spins far beyond my care,
In the garden, I find my place,
In lifeâ€™s simple grace, beauty laid bare.

- Albert Samain
