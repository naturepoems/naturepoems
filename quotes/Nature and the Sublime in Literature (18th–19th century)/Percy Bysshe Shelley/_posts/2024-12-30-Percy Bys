If Life is possible anew,
In quiet echoes of delight,
Then never dream of saying adieu,
To nature's gentle light.

For each petal that does fall,
Carries whispers of the past,
In the dance of Time's great hall,
Within pure beauty, cast.

As seasons turn, we share,
In every shade of green,
For in the soul of nature's air,
We find what has always been.

- Percy Bysshe Shelley
