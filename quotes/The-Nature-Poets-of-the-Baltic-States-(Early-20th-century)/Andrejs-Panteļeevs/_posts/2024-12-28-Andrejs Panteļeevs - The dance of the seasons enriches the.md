The dance of the seasons enriches the year,
From blossoms of spring to the frost of the fall,
Nature’s own painting, so vivid, so clear,
In hues that remind us to cherish it all.

The sun sets the canvas with strokes of pure gold,
As night drapes its cloak of stars shining bright,
In this tapestry woven, our stories unfold,
In the embrace of nature, we find our true light.

- Andrejs Panteļeevs
