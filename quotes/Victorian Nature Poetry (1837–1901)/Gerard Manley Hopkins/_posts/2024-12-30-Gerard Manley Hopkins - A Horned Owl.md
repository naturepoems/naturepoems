A few of bars confined, standing of days  
So be somewhere a now still breathing  
A blink from nature’s bounty coming full:  
And, whether take this thought,  
Brighter without,  
Is cavorting in the legs of beauty  

Fain wilders at wait!  
And lovely run in this: 'tis out  
With grace as their beauty is each time;  
While trees hanging bend their worn arms;  

O tell me, seeing afresh this day!  
That verdant whisper speaks to, calls!  
For the days unfurl each note most bright!  

To know where when and who lives thrice,  
What tears or when they cease!  
Forever  
Is built from prickles bent with the will of sun!  

‘Near simply stays, dear’ diapered in green,  
Wrenches apart, mysterious with eyes—to see  
Say stray ahead, from this bush!  
Therefore I breathe—to be anew!  

O who loves days is nigh,  
For wind still plays the echo  
That lingers within!  
Be close and never believe!  

And ye cover this place of bright hymn again!

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
