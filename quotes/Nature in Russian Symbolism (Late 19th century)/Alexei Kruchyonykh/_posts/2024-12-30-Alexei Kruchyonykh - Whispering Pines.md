Whispering Pines
Among the towering pines, I lose my way,
Natureâ€™s whispers guide me, come what may.
The scent of the earth, the rustle of leaves,
In the language of trees, the heart believes.

Each note in the wind carries tales of the past,
Speaking of journeys, both slow and fast.
Here in the forest, I feel the divine,
In the embrace of the woods, my spirit aligns.

- Alexei Kruchyonykh
