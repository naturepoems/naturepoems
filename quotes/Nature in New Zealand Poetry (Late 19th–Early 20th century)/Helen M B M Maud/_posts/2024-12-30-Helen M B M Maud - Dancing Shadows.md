Dancing Shadows

Beneath the trees, where light does weave,
The shadows play, a dance divine;
In flickered hues, our hearts believe,
In nature’s arms, the soul’s entwine.

A gentle breeze, the leaves react,
Like laughter shared, in simple glee;
Each rustle sounds, a sweet contract,
In shared existence, you and me.

So let us dance where shadows call,
In harmony with earth and sky;
For in this playful, tender thrall,
We find the essence of our why.

- Helen M B M Maud
