In the depths of the quiet woods,
Nature speaks in the rustle of leaves;
A language etched in ancient moods,
In the company of silent eves.

The branches sway in a gentle breeze,
While shadows play on the forest floor;
I find solace here, willing to seize,
The wonders that the heart can explore.

- Émile Zola
