quote: "Beneath the swell of the stormy sky,
A city pulses, a heartbeat nigh.
Rivers tear through concrete veins,
In their furious rush, they break the chains.

Wildflowers grow through fissures and cracks,
Defying the metal, they take their tracks.
In this disarray, a beauty resides,
Dada rhythms where spirit abides."

Beneath the swell of the stormy sky,
A city pulses, a heartbeat nigh.
Rivers tear through concrete veins,
In their furious rush, they break the chains.

Wildflowers grow through fissures and cracks,
Defying the metal, they take their tracks.
In this disarray, a beauty resides,
Dada rhythms where spirit abides.
