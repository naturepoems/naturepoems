Thee, Valley of the Shadow, thou wilt bear,
The wonders of the world upon thy face;
Thru’ every changing season’s nameless care,
I shall find solace in thy boundless grace.

From every tree that bows beneath the weight,
Of stars that twinkle in the velvet night,
Thou art the bower of dreams and love’s first mate,
In love abide, within thy calm, dear light.

Let me breathe deep amid thy fragrant air,
To linger in the nightingale's sweet song;
Here shall my spirit rest, my heart laid bare,
To nature’s soul where all the joys belong.

- John Keats
