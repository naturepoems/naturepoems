Sighing, the sea tells of the absence;  
The wind blows into the abyss,
In this salt and blue expanse  
That breathes with the sun.

God sleeps,
Waving leaves drift  
Into shadows;  
The dark ages creep  
And shoot like arrows.
Now in the distance,  
We forget the shores,  
That are like harpy graves.

- Salvatore Quasimodo
