A Narrow Fellow in the Grass  
Occasionally rides;  
You may have met him – did you not  
His notice sudden is –  

He flattens – like a Flounder –  
He finishes – like a Roll –  
And then you’re off –  
Like Bird or Bowl –  

But in a larger minute,  
He weaves between your Soul –  
To render Singly – Gloom –  
Within too narrow - whole –  

All Humans sprawl between the Grass –  
And all within the Hole –

- Emily Dickinson
