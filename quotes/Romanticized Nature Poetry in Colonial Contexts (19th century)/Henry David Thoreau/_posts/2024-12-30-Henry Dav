The Quiet Stream

A gentle stream winds through the vale,
Its waters clear, an echo of light,
Reflecting trees, the sky's soft hues,
With every ripple, a song takes flight.

As I lean near to hear its tale,
The whispers of time caress my ear,
Each flow, a memory softly strokes,
In nature's weave, my spirit clears.

And here I find my heart's retreat,
In the dance of water, rock, and leaf,
For in this quiet, simple place,
I shed my worries and my grief.

- Henry David Thoreau
