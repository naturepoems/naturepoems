The Spring and the Fall

“‘Tis true, I am in love with him,
He is so wise and fair and good,
But that I quietly fall with him,
Would zero up my chance of mood.
Oh the spring will bloom on the hill,
And the fountain bubble down with glee,
And though my heart may ache and still,
Mother, I’ll never set you free!"

And she looked down in the face of the moon,
With a selfish heart, and conquered tune,
As she kissed with love's defect and dish,
The air was honey, the water was bliss,
But poor heart should written bemoans:
Hope and sorrow—mothers and stones.
