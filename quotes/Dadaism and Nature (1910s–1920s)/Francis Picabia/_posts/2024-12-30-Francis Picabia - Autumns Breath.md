Autumn's Breath
Autumn breathes a mellow sigh,
a rusty copper kiss of change
echoed in the crunch beneath our feet;
each leaf a farewell,
each gust a whisper of memory.

The world transforms in vivid hues,
a canvas set ablaze,
it's nature's last grand show
before the winter shrouds everything
in stillness and frost,
a quiet chapter between seasons.

- Francis Picabia
