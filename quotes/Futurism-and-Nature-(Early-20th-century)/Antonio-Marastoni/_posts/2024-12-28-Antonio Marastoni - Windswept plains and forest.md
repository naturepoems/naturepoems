Windswept plains and forest dreams,
Where shadows mingle with the light,
Rustling leaves, they weave the seams,
Of day’s embrace and tranquil night.

Here, in the dance of sun and rain,
Life bursts forth in vibrant hues,
An endless cycle, joy and pain,
Nature’s dance, a lover's muse.

- Antonio Marastoni
