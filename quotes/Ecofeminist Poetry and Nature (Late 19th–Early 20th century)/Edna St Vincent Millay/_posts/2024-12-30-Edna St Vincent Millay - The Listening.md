THE LISTENING

In the fields I see the golden glre,
   When all the earth is still,
And cherished whispers of the boughs
   Cross the quiet of the hill.

There is a touch of Heaven’s breeze,
   And petals drift like dew,
And all the world is listening,
   For what it hath to do.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
