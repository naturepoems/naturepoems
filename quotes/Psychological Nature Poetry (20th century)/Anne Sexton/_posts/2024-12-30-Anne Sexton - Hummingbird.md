You can hear the heartbeat of hummingbirds,
How they pit-pat above the flowers’ open mouths,
Tasting, sampling the sweetened air,
In the embrace of springtime’s burgeoning,
Caught in the whirl of petal and color.
I hold a crystal cup in my palms,
Filled with blossoms and day's breath,
Surrounding their buzzing life,
While the sun smiles down, warm and piercing,
And I drift in the overflow of it,
Riding the currents of a moment,
When all of nature distills into quiet joy,
Freeing the soul into a dance of light.

- Anne Sexton
