Tadmor in the Desert
From the ancient stones sleeping there,  
To the skies with promises bright;  
A story held in gazing stare,  
In a yearning for time’s delight.

As winds ride through the hollowed halls,  
And whispers stir the evening’s glow;  
Echoes of the past as darkness calls,  
Will bloom through the ages, soft and slow.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
