Leda

    The swan
is not dead,
    he moves beneath
        the willow tree,
        amazing and gray,
the coolness overwhelming,
    as he raises his neck
to waterfall,
    to the wind.

In the long grasses, he goes,
        softly unaware
until we take hold,
    and come to him
        in daybreak.
He thrums,
    he lifts up slowly,
        by the waterâ€™s edge.

The swan
    is taking flight,
    to home from love
to desire,
and a soft foliage
glides about his throat,
    until time brings grief!
        O memory!
