Whispers of Spring

When the world awakens from slumber’s embrace,    
Upon the bleary mornings spray;    
With a flutter of wings and sweet sounds of grace—   
Come, whispers of spring  
Returning with promise of life,    
In dance of blooms and heart's delight!  
Birds sing to the sky—   
Lifting spirits up anew;    
Oh, joyous breezes carrying soft perfume,    
Embracing warmth from golden rays,    
Where love breathes in silence with each frame,    
The earth unfolds softly,  
An artist's every gift remains.
