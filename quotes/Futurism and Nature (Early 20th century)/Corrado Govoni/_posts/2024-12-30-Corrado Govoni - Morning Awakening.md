In the morning
with the smile of a flower,
dewdrops awaken
on the grass blades.
The sky, like a great
blue sea,
sings soft with birds,
filling the heart
with whispers of spring.

Under the sunlight,
the world is reborn,
bright colors bloom
and dance in the wind,
as shadows play
on the ground,
tracing the outlines
of forgotten dreams.

- Corrado Govoni
