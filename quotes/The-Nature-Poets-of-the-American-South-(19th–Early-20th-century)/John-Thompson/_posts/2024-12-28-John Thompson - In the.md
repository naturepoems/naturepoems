In the Forest

Deep in the dappled shade,
Where the ferns whisper soft secrets,
And sunlight weaves through branches,
I find the ancient pulse of life.

Moss carpets the earth
With a blanket of green,
And the scent of cedar and earth,
Wraps around me like a memory.

Birds chirp above, a chorus,
Filling the air with melody,
While the stream tumbles over stones,
An endless refrain of nature's song.

Here is where I breathe,
In the embrace of towering trees,
My heart beats in rhythm
With this sanctuary of peace.


- John Thompson
