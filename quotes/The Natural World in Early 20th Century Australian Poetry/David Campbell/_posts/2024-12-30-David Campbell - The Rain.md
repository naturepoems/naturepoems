The Rain

The rain comes soft, like a motherâ€™s touch,
  As it caresses the earth where it lies;
Tears down the passage and down from above,
  To embrace all the hearts and sighs.

In the fields, it dances a gentle stride,
  While the puddles form with a grace;
Oh the rhythm echoes with breathing pride,
  In the pattern drawn by the face.

For each drop sparkles, lifts all the weight,
  Where the leaves begin to glow;
And a song will rise from the depths of fate,
  With the beauty that is ours to grow.

- David Campbell
