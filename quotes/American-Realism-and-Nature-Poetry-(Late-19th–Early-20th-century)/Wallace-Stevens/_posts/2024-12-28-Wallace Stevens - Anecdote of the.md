Anecdote of the Jar

I placed a jar in Tennessee,
And round it went.
Upon a hill it stood,
And looked at the sky
And looked at the sky.

The jar was round upon the ground
And tall and of a portland stone,
It took dominion everywhere.
The jar was gray and bare.

When once I sat upon a hill
And looked at the sky,
The sky was blue and sprightly,
And that, too, took dominion everywhere.

But in the mountain’s distance,
The evening light shone on,
And there was I, just a jar,
And the world was all around me.


- Wallace Stevens
