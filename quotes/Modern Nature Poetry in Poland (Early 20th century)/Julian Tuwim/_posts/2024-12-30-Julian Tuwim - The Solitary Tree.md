A solitary tree stands tall,
Marking time with its gnarled bark,
Whispers of strength in each branch,
Alive with the life of the park.

Through seasons, it bears witness,
To the lovers who carve their names,
In its trunk, the stories linger,
Memories weave like shimmering flames.

In the embrace of this living being,
Life flows through its roots underground,
Connected to the heartbeat of earth,
In this sacred silence found.

- Julian Tuwim
