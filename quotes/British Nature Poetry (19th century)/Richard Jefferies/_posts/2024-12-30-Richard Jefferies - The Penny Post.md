The Penny Post
Each post will bring me news of thee,

And when the wind is cold and bleak,

And when the trees are bare and stark,

I'll long for thee, my love.

Each letter, each small packet,

Will be like a precious treasure,

Each word a moment that I cherish,

In the warmth of my heart's enclosure.

- Richard Jefferies
