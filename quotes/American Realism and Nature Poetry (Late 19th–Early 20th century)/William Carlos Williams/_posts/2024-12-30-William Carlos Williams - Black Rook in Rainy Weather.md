Black Rook in Rainy Weather

This poem is

a black rook

in rainy weather

and the near soft

bed of rains
  and the wild

as entirely absent

but left
to stand up

in the rain.

I can feel
it swell in ripeness,
draw near,
ear now,
at the river branch}
running still;  smooth
and as soft. 

This dew.
I can find the rain is returning

to the heat of the earth.

- William Carlos Williams
