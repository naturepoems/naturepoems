In Vain

I stood on the bridge at midnight,
As a bridge, towering over the dark water,
And watched the stars shine bright.
I longed for the night to cast its spell,
But tears fell, my heart never swell.

In vain I sought the beauty above,
The moonlit faces, shapes divine,
Yet, a stranger to such love,
Was this lonely heart of mine.


- Edward Thomas
