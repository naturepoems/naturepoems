Elegy

Lay me down here amongst the flowers,
Their gentle caress, their fluids unfold,
As days roll by softly in brief hours,
Your petals trail over past glories told.

Your languid whispers breathe soft serenades,
The day's lingering light soon begot,
While the twilight fades to adventurous shades,
I rest within dreams once forgotten, not.


- Charles Baudelaire
