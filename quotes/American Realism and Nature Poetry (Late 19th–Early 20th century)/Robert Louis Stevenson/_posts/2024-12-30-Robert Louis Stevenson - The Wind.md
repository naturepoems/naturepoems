The Wind
I saw you, wind, so soft and free,  
       As you danced upon the sea;  
You played with every ship that passed,  
       And filled their sails; you were so fast!

On mountain tops you whispered low,  
       And caused the tall trees to sway to and fro;  
In valleys deep you whistled loud,  
       And scattered leaves from every cloud.

O wind, you sing a sweet refrain,  
       Through echoes of both joy and pain;  
You move the hearts of those who roam,  
       And lead us ever back to home.




- Robert Louis Stevenson
