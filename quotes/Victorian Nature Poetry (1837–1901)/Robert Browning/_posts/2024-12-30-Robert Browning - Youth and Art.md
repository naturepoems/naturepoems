Youth and Art  
I.  
My love, my own,  
I bring you flowers  
To fill the bower—  
But the bloom is gone,  
Though the petals linger,  
And the beauty clings  
To your graceful finger!  

II.  
Oh, youth goes wild—  
But you will not cease  
To cherish wild flowers,  
And when the light  
Of my art grows dim,  
I shall still remember  
The joys and the fears,  
The splendor so clear  
In your amber tears!

- Robert Browning
