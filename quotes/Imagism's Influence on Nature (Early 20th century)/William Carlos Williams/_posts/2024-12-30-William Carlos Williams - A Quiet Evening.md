A Quiet Evening
Where hawks fly
Over the crickets.

Clouds rolled,
The night softly returns
To the horizon.

In the shadow of coming stir,
That continues crickets born,
We recognize,
The slowly enforcing you.

Such evenings grow
Under the wheatâ€”
The moist, soft air.

But the sky blackens
And begins to call,
We walk alone.

In the dark,
In that sigh,
The ways gone are lost!

- William Carlos Williams
