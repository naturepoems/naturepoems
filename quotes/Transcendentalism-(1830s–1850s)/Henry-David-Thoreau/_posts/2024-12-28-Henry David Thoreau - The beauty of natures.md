The beauty of nature's hues,
Enfolds the morning sun,
That peeks through mountain shadows,
With a warmth that stirs the heart—
The stillness of a bubbling brook,
Whispers secrets to the trees,
And reflects the very essence,
Of tranquility earned through solitude,
A moment where life pauses,
To breathe with me,  
And in that breath, I thrive.

- Henry David Thoreau
