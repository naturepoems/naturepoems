The Singing Brook

Rippling serenade,
As you dance over stones,
In laughter and joy,
You sing all alone.

The breeze carries whispers,
Of secrets you keep,
In a melody flowing,
Where the soft shadows sleep.

Oh brook, gentle brook,
With your crystal embrace,
You sing to the heart,
In your fleeting grace.

- John Thompson
