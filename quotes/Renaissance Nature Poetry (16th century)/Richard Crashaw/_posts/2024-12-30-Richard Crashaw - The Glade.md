The Glade  
In shadowed glade where silence dwells,  
A tapestry of green unfolds,  
With petals bright, nature compels,  
Her touch, a story softly told.

Here laughter dances on the breeze,  
On whispered winds, in raindrops play,  
With every rustle through the trees,  
The world at peace, in sweet ballet.

Oh, take me deeper in your care,  
Where wild things bloom without a fear,  
In this embrace, a whispered prayer,  
Forever in this moment near.

So let me roam where beauty lives,  
In natureâ€™s arms, my heart shall stay,  
For all the joy that love still gives,  
Shall flourish here, where souls can stray.

- Richard Crashaw
