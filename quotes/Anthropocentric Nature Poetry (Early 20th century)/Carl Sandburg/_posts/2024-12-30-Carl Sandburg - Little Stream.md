Where are you going, little stream,  
    wandering with a song in your heart?
Sometimes I think it is you  
    who is leading me on,
Through the trees and over rocks,  
     Singing the sweetest tune.

Oh, to be like you,  
    to flow with the sun,  
To follow the wind  
    in the cool of the day,  
To find myself lost in the embrace  
    of the world so bright and new.

- Carl Sandburg
