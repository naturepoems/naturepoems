Buddhist and some sort of
   salary in gold or our
   self, owls hoot weekly
   at midnight, bemused in the
   purple dark.
   Why do things grow after
   all, twisty trees?—
   The copsies out with baseball bats,
   contorted light.
   There it is in black and white
   but some of it
   is very hard to see, jade trees
   leaning in the void.

- Philip Whalen
