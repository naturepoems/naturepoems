Eagle flying high, with wings of thunder,
soar above the valleys where wild rivers run.

The world below hums with the heart of the earth,
a vibrant palette of green and gold.

Among the whispering trees that sway,
ancient songs in the breeze, a timeless dance.

You chase the shadows of the sun,
it's a freedom found in the flight of the wild.

- Kate Bush
