And what is so rare as a day in June?
Then, if ever, come perfect days;
Then Heaven tries the earth if it be in tune,
And, overtures the sky, and true is all its rays.

The buds have burst, and the leaves have grown,
And the satin-shining flowers have shown;
And the distant woods are tender and clear,
And my heart is full but mostly sincere.

There is never much holding upon the air,
Yet every breath seems to awaken near,
And a melody creeps softly in the sun,
Up through the branches, every season won.

Ah! but one day will always return -
When time slips slowly ‘long the wind,
To summon nature, and all her charms,
While my heart enchants her distant arms,
For nothing will ever seem to withhold
The touch of beauty forming into gold.

- Matthew Arnold
