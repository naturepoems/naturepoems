The Meadow
In the meadow’s gentle sweep,
Where wildflowers sway and hum,
The sun dances with shadows,
Coaxing laughter from the blooms.
Here, time drifts like tired clouds,
And the breeze carries sweet scents,
Nature’s embrace felt deep in the heart,
As the world spins softly around,
In this sanctuary of calm,
Where every moment is sacred.


- John Gould Fletcher
