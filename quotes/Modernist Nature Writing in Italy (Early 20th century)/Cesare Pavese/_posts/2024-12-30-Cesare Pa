**Harvest Time**  
In the golden fields,  
The harvest sings its melody,  
A sacred rhythm of labor,  
With hands worn and calloused,  
Beneath the sun’s watchful gaze.  

Wheat sways like prayers,  
Soft whispers of blessings abound,  
As laughter mingles with the wind,  
And the earth offers her bounty  
To those who toil and care.  

Let me gather this moment,  
Fill my heart with gratitude,  
For in every seed sown,  
In every grain collected,  
Lies the essence of life itself.  

—Cesare Pavese
