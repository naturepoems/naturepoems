Winter’s twilight flows like a phantom
Through leafless boughs, forlorn;  
Where souls find solace in barren dreams,  
And lost hopes await the dawn.

Oh, how still the night is held! 
How distant the colors fade;  
But a whisper amongst the shadows,  
In night’s good graces laid.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
