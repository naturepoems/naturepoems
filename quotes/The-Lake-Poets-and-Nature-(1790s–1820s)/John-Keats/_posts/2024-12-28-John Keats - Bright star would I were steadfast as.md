Bright star! would I were steadfast as thou art—
Not in lone splendor hung aloft the night
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like nature's patient sleepless Eremite,

The moving waters at their priest-like task
Of pure thoughts into the bottomless sea,
And while the world is whispering in its dreams,

*Original suggest not other thoughts receive,
Except for love's own heart to bless awake,  
To soothe the eyes with darking sensibilities.*

- John Keats
