The Indian Burying Ground

In spite of all the noise and sounds,
Which comes from wind and storm;

I sit upon this sacred ground,
Among the trees so warm.

What beauty dwells within this space,
Where once the brave took flight;

Now peaceful in their resting place,
They greet me here at night.


- Philip Freneau
