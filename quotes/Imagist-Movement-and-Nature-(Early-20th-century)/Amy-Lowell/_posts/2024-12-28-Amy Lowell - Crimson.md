Crimson buds,
Fleece the air with promise,
As they stretch and yawn,
In the cradle of spring.
Fingers of green,
Graze the earth gently,
Awakening an orchestra,
Of colors yet unsung.

In a moment —
Life encircles itself,
And the wheel turns,
With laughter in every leaf,
The music of the world,
Unfolds in hues of joy.

— Amy Lowell
