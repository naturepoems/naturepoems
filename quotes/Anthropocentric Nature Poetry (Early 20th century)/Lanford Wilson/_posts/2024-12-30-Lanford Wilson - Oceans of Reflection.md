The ocean is an endless mirror,  
reflecting the moods of the sky,  
today a palette of blues,  
where the waves kiss the shore  
and sand cradles dreams.  
Seabirds circle, calling,  
as salt hangs thick in the air,  
a tangy reminder of  
a life living free.  
In the depths below,  
a world pulses with mysteries,  
creatures weaving through  
the currents,  
the rhythm of existence  
intertwined with the ebb  
and flow of the tides;  
a reminder that we are  
all part of this beautiful chaos.
