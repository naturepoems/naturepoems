quote: "At the edge of the bog  
Sunlight breaks like glass -  
The heron lifts its wings,  
A silent shadow on  
Reflected blue.  
Each moment stretches,  
A pulse of time in  
Green reeds."

At the edge of the bog  
Sunlight breaks like glass -  
The heron lifts its wings,  
A silent shadow on  
Reflected blue.  
Each moment stretches,  
A pulse of time in  
Green reeds.
