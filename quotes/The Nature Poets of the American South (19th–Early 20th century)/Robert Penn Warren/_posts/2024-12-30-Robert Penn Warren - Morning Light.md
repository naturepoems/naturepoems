Morning Light

In the tender dawn, the earth does wake,
As golden rays through branches break,
And dew-kissed grass whispers to the day,
While fog retreats in the sun's warm sway.

Birdsong fills the air, bright and clear,
In ethereal notes, the world draws near,
The warmth of light on a canvas grand,
Colors brush the skies, across the land.

With every breath, life starts anew,
In morning light, the heart breaks through,
There’s magic here in the gentle rise,
Where hope begins, beneath the skies.


- Robert Penn Warren
