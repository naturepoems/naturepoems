O what a life among the trees,
   To breathe the breath of summer air,
With every sound that fills with ease,
   Sweet fragrance blended everywhere.

The woodlands stretch and bow in pride,
   Where stillness reigns o’er every strain;
While gentle whispers strident guide
   The heart to forests’ rich domain.

- John Clare
