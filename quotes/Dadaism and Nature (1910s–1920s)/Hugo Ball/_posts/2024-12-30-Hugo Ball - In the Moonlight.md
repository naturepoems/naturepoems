In the Moonlight
Waves of the sea
Whisper across the sand
Touched by the moon’s fickle light
Creeping shadows dance
Upon tranquil waters,
As if we are held in dreams
Entwined with rhythm and tides,
The night weeps softly.

O, how I wish to drift.
To float far away,
On a breath of wind.
Wandering here and there,
Through forests made of silver,
Where echoes laugh and thunder,
In a silk of endless night.

- Hugo Ball
