A Silent Celebration
Nature's orchestration unfolds,
a symphony that dances through
leafy canopies and starlit skies;
a silent celebration
for those who dare to hear.

The rustling leaves wrap you
in melody, in pulse,
the heartbeat of existence,
each note a reminder that we belong
to this radiant chaos,
a part of creation's tapestry.

- Francis Picabia
