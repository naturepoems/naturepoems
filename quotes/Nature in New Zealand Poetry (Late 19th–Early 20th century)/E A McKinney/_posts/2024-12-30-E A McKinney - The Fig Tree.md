The Fig Tree

In the warm embrace of the sun’s golden rays,
The fig tree stands proud in the summer’s warm blaze,
With branches that sway in the softest of breeze,
A testament written in the whispers of leaves.

Her fruits dangle tempting, their sweetness profound,
A bounty of nature, in humble ground found,
With roots intertwined in the earth's loving grace,
The fig tree remains a most cherished place.

And under her shade, with the world given pause,
We gather ourselves, and reflect on the cause,
For nature’s own gifts, so simple yet true,
From the fig tree, life offers a view.
