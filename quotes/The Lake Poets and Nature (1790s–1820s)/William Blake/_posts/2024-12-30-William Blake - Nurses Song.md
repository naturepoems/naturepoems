Nurse's Song  
When voices of children are heard on the green,  
And laughing is heard on the hill,  
My heart is at ease, for the voice of the boy  
Is heard in the valley.  
  
And play and delight in that sound  
Is pleasure in the blazing light.  
  
Come hither, my children;  
I care not for your idleness!  
  
Your joy is for me the sweetest reward  
And I’ll weep if you don't take my delight!
**William Blake**
