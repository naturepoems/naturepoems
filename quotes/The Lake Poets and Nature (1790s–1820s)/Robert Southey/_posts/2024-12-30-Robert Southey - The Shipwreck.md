The Shipwreck

  ’Tis feared that the sun will rise,
When tempests gnaw the waves in sea;
The night hath claimed a moans of sighs—
  Echoing across the lea.

But lo! even when the winds begat
As fathomed o’er the crystal deep,
It makes no heartless heart to fret,
  When broken vows sleep.

Through whistling winds amid the tides,
  No love shall sink in pride,
But sails must frame their weary slides,
  To clasp the land for stride.

Yet every swan shall bear his joy,
  When exiled birds are true—
There’s shiny dawn at nature’s cry,
  When hope meets all the blue!

- Robert Southey
