The Great Oak
Majestic oak that stands alone,
Through storms and sunshine, you have grown,
With branches strong that reach the sky,
A home for birds that soar and fly.
Your leaves do whisper tales of yore,
A guardian true of earth’s great lore;
In your shade, wisdom doth abide,
In nature’s kingdom, you’re the pride.
