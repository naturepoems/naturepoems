The Destruction of the World

What can I do,
while the world crumbles,
a shard of glass,
in the cathedral of nature?

Fragile blooms,
fighting for life,
while the sky weeps blooms,
a torrential rain of sorrow.

Yet still I see,
in every corner,
the stubbornness of life,
the refusal to surrender,
a vow to the earth,
a hymn to existence.


- Czesław Miłosz
