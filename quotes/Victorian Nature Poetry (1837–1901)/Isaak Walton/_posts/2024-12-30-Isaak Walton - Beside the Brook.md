Come sit beside this brook so clear,
  Where time stands still and cares all cease,
  The water speaks in tones sincere,
  In every bubble, find release.

And as the world rushes away,
  We’ll pause to watch the ripples play,
  For in this hour, we’ll find a way,
  To cherish life, to love, to stay.

- Isaak Walton
