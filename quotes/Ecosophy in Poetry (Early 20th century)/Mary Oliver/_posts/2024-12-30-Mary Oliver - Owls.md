Owls

The four owls rise  
     in the moonlight,  
     a group of dark secrets,  
     like four corners of a room,  
     holding their sorrows closeâ€”  
     wise and still,  
     watching the stars shift  
     through velvet blackness,  
     filling their gaze with wonder.  
     The symbol of twilight,  
     the hymn of the night,  
     they muse to themselves,  
     to the skies,  
     to the fleeting moments  
     that slip away,  
     on cat feet,  
     wanting only to understand  
     the quiet heart of the dark.

- Mary Oliver
