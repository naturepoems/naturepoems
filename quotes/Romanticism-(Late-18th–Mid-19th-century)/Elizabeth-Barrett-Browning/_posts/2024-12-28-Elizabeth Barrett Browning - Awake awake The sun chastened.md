Awake, awake! The sun chastened fulfills
Its boundless promise amidst each bloom and rust,
O freshness sweet, in air the sweetest spills—
The morning grass shall bloom on every gust.

And here we drink in every scent of dew,
With open eyes of daisies strewn across heaven,
O heart of mine, ever true and new,
In longing for peace the world hath given.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
