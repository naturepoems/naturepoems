A lonely flower blooms upon the rock,  
In solitude, she braves life’s fiercest gale;  
Her colors bright, though trapped by Nature's block,  
She thrives against the odds, does not curtail.  

In every petal, echoes of despair,  
Yet through each struggle, life is forged anew;  
A symbol strong, of courage and of care—  
Let not your heart be stilled, let it break through!
