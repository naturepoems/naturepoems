Morning Fog

A cool mist lifts,
a blanket over water,
gradually revealing the world.
A silence pervades the trees,
a moment stretches
between breaths.

Bird calls pierce through slowly,
like a soft kiss on the cheek,
both fragile and profound.
All is awake,
but still asleep,
a reverie in gray. 

Philip Whalen
