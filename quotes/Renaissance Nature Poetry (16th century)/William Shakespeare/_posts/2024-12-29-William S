The earth has music for those who listen,
And whispers sweetly in the trees' embrace.
Through leafy shade, the sunbeams softly glisten,
Upon the sparkling brook and nature’s grace.

Each flower blooms, a symphony that sings,
In harmony with nature's vibrant sound.
The soaring lark and all its joyous flings,
While seasons weave their tales on solid ground.

Let me, sweet muse, discover all you are—
Each leaf, each breeze, each dew-kissed morn shall guide,
The band of life moves onward, near and far,
In rhythms of the dusk and day, we bide.

And so, my heart finds solace in your way,
O Nature, pure and free, in all I say.

- William Shakespeare
