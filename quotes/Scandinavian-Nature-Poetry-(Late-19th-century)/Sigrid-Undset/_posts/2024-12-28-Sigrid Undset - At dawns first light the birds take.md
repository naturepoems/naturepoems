At dawn's first light, the birds take flight,  
Their songs a call, a sweet delight.  
Among the meadows of golden hue,  
A symphony plays as the morning’s due.

Butterflies dance on the warm, soft breeze,  
Nature’s chorus, a tender tease.  
In every petal, in every sigh,  
I find my muse beneath the sky.

- Sigrid Undset
