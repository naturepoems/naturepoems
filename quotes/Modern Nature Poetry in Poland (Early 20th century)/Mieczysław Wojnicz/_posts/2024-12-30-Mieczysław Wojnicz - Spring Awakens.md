Spring Awakens
With every bud, the world awakes,
A symphony of life it makes,
The earth adorned in colors bright,
A canvas kissed by morning light.

From icy grasp, the flowers bloom,
In fragrant air, dispelling gloom,
As nature sings her joyful song,
In spring’s embrace, we all belong.

- Mieczysław Wojnicz
