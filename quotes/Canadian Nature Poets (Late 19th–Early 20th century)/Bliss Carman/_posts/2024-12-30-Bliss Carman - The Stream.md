THE STREAM

The stream, where flowers strew its shore  
And the length of the meadows bear  
Rich emeralds, as they stretch and soar—  
Is filled with a laugh in air.

Its rippling laughter breaks and leaps  
Through the crags and the woods along;  
With every ripple, every sweep,  
Flows softly the stream of song.

And as the flow’rs where skies lie red  
Reach deep in the river’s play,  
So the light in the dark will spread  
As waters dance with rays!
