The star’s tears,
delicate,
quiver on the
moonlit surface
of the bay,
they are the sounds
of the heavens,
in fair water.

Each night,
I whisper secrets
and they melt,
a silver chain,
a ruin of light
strung out above
the twilight. 

Give me the light
to touch,
a careless garden;
let me rest upon
the shadows,
till evening comes
and steals the stars.
In the silence
a warm breath,
it moves like destiny,
reaches to the dreams
of the waters,
a song that
never dies.
