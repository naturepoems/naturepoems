A Field  

A gleaming shell upon the shore,  
The sea, so calm, unheard doth pour;  
The chaplet of the earth renews,  
So fledgling thrushes burst through hue!  

The clouds on azure mirrors lie;  
The breezes steep; the naked sky  
Spread wide with morning, silent clear,  
While warblers spin, and love is here!  

The reapers tread, and quickly round,  
The wheat doth sway, a golden pound;  
The fragrant dread of rose-entide  
In nature, soft, doth rest to hide!

- William Hazlitt
