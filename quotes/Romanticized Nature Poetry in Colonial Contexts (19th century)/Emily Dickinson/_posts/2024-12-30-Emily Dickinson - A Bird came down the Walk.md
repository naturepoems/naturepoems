A Bird, came down the Walk—  
He did not know I saw—  
He bit an Angleworm in halves  
And ate the fellow, raw,  

And then he drank a Dew  
From a convenient Grass—  
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall  
And hunted for his class—  

He glanced with wide—bolted eyes—  
At Miles—of Sticks—of Trees—  
And the Snare—was his—  
On the ground  

It was a Pigeon’s Nest.  
"A Bird, came down the Walk"

- Emily Dickinson
