What know we of the storm or of the sun?  
We, wanderers in a world so wholly bare,  
Shall know their tale when life is nearly done;  
But now we breathe the fragrance of the air,  
And stand beneath the swaying blossom trees,  
The morning's green, the evening's soft caress,  
And feel in every heart, the whispering seas  
Of nature's thoughts, her song, her endless bliss.

- Bliss Carmen
