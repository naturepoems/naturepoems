Nature  
Shy, she wore a green skirt  
   and moved silently like the waning day,  
till the waves broke in white light  
     over dim purple rocks;  
but I watched my heart go toward her,  
among the shells of rolling trees,  
   quick weeds, and driftwood mist,  
    gathering shadow into one last pause,  
    where the sunset could not fall . . . 

- Louise Bogan
