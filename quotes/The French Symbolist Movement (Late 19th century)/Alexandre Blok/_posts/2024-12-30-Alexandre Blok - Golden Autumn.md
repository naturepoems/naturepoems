Golden Autumn

In harvest gold, the fields are layered,
As sunbeams slip through saffron light,
Nature’s palette sings of bounty shared,
With whispers of the coming night.

Crimson and amber in a dance divine,
Where leaves cascade in freedom's flight,
A lullaby of life intertwined,
In harmony shines the waning light.

Oh, nature breathes her final sighs,
Before her slumber 'neath blankets bright;
Yielding to winter’s cold embrace,
As autumn bows down, its luminous grace.

- Alexandre Blok
