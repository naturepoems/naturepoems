In the air, a bird
is a vision, not a vision
of itself, 
but a vision of a circle,
approaching a circle, 
a glass that reflects
on water.

A bird flies
into space,
breaking waves,
smoke circles,
drawing the vibrancy
of the trees,
the cry of the earth, 
a crystalline song,
a vital song.

To be alive is to live
in the body of air, 
where love is heard
in the womb of wind.

- Cecilia Vicuña
