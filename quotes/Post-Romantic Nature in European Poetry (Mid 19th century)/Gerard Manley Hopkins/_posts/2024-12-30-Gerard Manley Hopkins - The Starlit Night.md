The Starlit Night

Star-sown skies, angels leap,
  O what in swang and cry, sad to speak!
  Down a road toward, as it grows bright,
  And round, round, facilitates flight.

Versed here I hear, that in the far,
  The main madding peaceful star.

In the snow without you, I sing, it will be!
  You were my ship and all seen, can be divine!
  What beholds, shuts, and passes free.


- Gerard Manley Hopkins
