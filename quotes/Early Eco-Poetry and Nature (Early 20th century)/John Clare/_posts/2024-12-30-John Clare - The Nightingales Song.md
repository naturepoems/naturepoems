The Nightingale’s Song
O, when the well-timed day is gone  
And the dusky night descends,  
A breathless silence grows upon  
The distance where all music ends.
 
In every bird their song is sweet  
Yet joy it gives to those who hear,  
Long before the footfall’s beat  
And then the familiar voices near.
 
There's music deep in every night  
And echoes from the woods alone,  
When suddenly the world takes flight  
To sing of flowers and touch the stone.

- John Clare
