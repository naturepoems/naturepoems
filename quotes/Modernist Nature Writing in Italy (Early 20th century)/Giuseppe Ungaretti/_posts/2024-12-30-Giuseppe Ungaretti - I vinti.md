I vinti

  The defeated, 
  Shadows of men,
  Mute forms,
  You drift
  Through sunlit grovesâ€”  
  Forgotten,  
  As leaves and things,  
  Rain in the trees  
  Withering  
  Among thorns,  
  Glistening air.  
  They drift  
  Without breath or name,  
  Under the buzz of life.  
   

  
  


- Giuseppe Ungaretti
