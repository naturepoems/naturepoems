quote: "I found a flower  
a solitary bloom,  
the petals unfold  
like whispers of joy  
speaking to the sun  
in their golden hour,  
a moment of nature  
held in the heart of solitude."

I found a flower  
a solitary bloom,  
the petals unfold  
like whispers of joy  
speaking to the sun  
in their golden hour,  
a moment of nature  
held in the heart of solitude.
