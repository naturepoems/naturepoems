In yonder calm and quiet spot,
Where wair my beings long have met,
The gentle night no longer hot,
That hides my dolorous heart’s regret.
What if the night did darkness bring?
The moon that sleeps in solemn peace;
Life’s hidden voice is nothingness,
And in her light, all sorrows sing.

-- Robert Southey, "Night in the Woods"
