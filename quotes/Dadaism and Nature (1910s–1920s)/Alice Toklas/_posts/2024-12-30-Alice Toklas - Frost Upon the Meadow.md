Fingers of frost,
a gentle caress,
tracing the edges
of the morning light—
a reminder,
every season cradles
its own artistry,
a Dadaist recognition of beauty.

In the meadow,
green sprouts push
through the remnants of winter,
a call to rebirth,
a testament to resilience,
a high note in nature’s song.

Clouds roam, free,
a rabble of thoughts,
a collage in motion,
a reflection of moods,
a symphony of gray
and blue,
a fleeting presence
against the canvas of sky.

I walk,
a traveler among
swaying grasses,
a moment suspended,
feeling the pulse of life,
creeping in,
brushing against skin,
a whispering promise,
oh, what a play!

Let me dwell here,
in the embrace of earth,
reminding myself,
I am part of this,
this wild beauty,
a flicker in the grand scheme.
