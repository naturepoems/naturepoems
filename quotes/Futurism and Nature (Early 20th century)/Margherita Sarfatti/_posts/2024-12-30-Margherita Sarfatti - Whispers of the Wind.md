The wind passes,
a hurried whisper,
a shake of branches, raw and free.
It sees the city,
inhabited by dreams,
inspired by future's love,
a dance of iron and glass,
but still it longs, â€“
the deafening solitude of nature,
a lone shadow, flexible,
a bridge sought in the wilderness.

- Margherita Sarfatti
