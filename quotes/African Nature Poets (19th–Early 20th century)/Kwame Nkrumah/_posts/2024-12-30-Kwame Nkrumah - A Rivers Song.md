A River's Song
Flow, river, flow, under the skies so blue,
Carving the earth with magic anew.
Your crystal waters, a laughter so bright,
Reflecting the stars in the tranquil night.

Each ripple a whisper, each wave a sigh,
A journey eternal, beneath the vast sky.
With stones as your choir, and banks as your friend,
You sing of beginnings, and never an end.

- Kwame Nkrumah
