Merry-Go-Round

The rhythm of the hungry cities,
In the murmurs of the gathered crowd,
And laughter echoing against the walls,
The children beckon in a merry-go-round.

Round and round, oh round it goes,
The frost and the heat mingle, and stubborn,
As late dusk catches the colors,
Or the pale light of an early dawn.

I hesitate, just glance askew,
To trace the firefly's glow.
The trees waving their leaves eagerly respond,
And the stars slide upward toward the sun.

So the world must turn, and turn again,
Till dusk be hallowed, soft as a sigh,
But it will wait, patiently
till your heart catches and learn like melodies.

Hey, my dear, hold close to me,
In dreams and voice, let the clouds drift—
This land is rich with spirits,
And a heart that beats, endlessly high.

—Langston Hughes
