THE CALL OF THE SEA

O the call of the sea is a calling so bold,
With whispers of longing and stories untold;
It sings of the tide and the ships that have sailed,
Of dreams pursued and of hearts that have failed.

The waves crash in rhythms, a symphony grand,
As seagulls cry out, guardians of sand;
The foam dances lightly on the windswept shore,
While salt in the air is a quest for more.

In the hush of the night, when all seems at rest,
The ocean sighs softly, a lover’s own nest;
And I, bound to its magic, with a heart open wide,
Let the call of the sea be my faithful guide.

So, come with me, wanderer, let us explore,
For the sea holds the answers that we long to score;
Together we’ll walk where the wild waves play,
In the heart of the ocean, we’ll find our way.

- Thomas Bracken
