The Garden's Heart

In the embrace of petals,
Colors fuse and blend,
Life unveils its beauty,
Where the garden sings, my friend.

Each blossom holds a promise,
Of stories yet to bloom,
In this haven of solace,
Every shadow sheds its gloom.

Nature's tender caress,
Whispers hope and grace,
In the heart of the garden,
Love finds its rightful place.

- Ossie Mthembu
