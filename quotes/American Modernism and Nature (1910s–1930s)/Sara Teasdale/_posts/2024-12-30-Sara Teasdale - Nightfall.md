The evening is calm and clear,
with stars brushing the sleeping earth.
I wander beneath their watchful gaze,
as the cool air sways overhead.

I listen to the night,
as crickets keep their chorus,
reminding, urging dreams to rise
beneath the silent moon's glow.

Oh, how I long to walk in this peace,
bathed in all that is still and near—
a harmony found in the darkness,
where nature's sighs bring comfort.

- Sara Teasdale
