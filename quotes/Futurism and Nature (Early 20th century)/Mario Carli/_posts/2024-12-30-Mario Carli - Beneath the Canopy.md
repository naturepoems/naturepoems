Beneath the Canopy
In the shadows of the ancient trees,
Life murmurs softly,
Under the arch of twirling branches,
Where light dances,
And sunlight dapples the ground,
A secret world unfurls,
With creatures darting,
And the whispers of leaves,
In the coolness of shade,
Nature's cathedral stands,
As birds flit about,
Their songs weaving through the air,
In this sanctuary,
Life and time intertwine,
Underneath the towering giants,
A precious balance of existence.


- Mario Carli
