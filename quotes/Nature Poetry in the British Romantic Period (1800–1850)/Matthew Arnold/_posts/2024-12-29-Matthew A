Elysium
When thought at first upon thee roves,
In hopes that love may brighten love,
The soul's return shall see, 'twas not by groves
One drew thy breath in the hidden grove.

For cool winds raise the secret breath,
In silent joy love warms the heart,
So late we heed not joy nor death,
But life is sweet and love is part.

- Matthew Arnold
