To a Snail
   Consider, the snail
   with its spiral home,
   carrying the weight
   of its own making,
   the tiny shell—serene,
   slower than time itself,
   turning,
   it knows the pace
   that will preserve the trail,
   the view changed by
   the precision of instinct and
   nature’s graces.

- Marianne Moore
