Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Early Childhood
There was a boy; when he had heard
The laughter of the other boys,
He ran away to work, his fate,
To find a lily by the lake,

And so with strictness did he stand,
Till he had drawn that flower, and thought
It all the child might do.

And he that loved these childish ways
Of being in the air to breathe,
And seeing the sun to shine,
Had learned to feel much more than praise.

- William Wordsworth
