In the Hills

In these hands of clay,  
     I fashion a bird
     from nothingness,  
a spirit  
     that enacts 
     longings.
What harmony 
     between wing and wind,  
     against the cold flutters, 
and drifts of the feathered song.  

Iâ€™ll set it free  
     to roam  
     the vast silence  
yonder,
     in the cool arms of dusk, 
echoing the hills 
     that rise and fold 
     under a blanket of stars.


- R S Thomas
