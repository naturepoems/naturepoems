The Moon

Oh moon, thou hast a serene face,  
Thy beauty covers glowing space,  
Through shadows shifting, soft and bright,  
Drenching each flower and tree in light.  

Night takes its cue from thy bright face,  
Delivering calm in every place,  
While light flows soft upon the sea,  
A whisper of peace and duty.  

Each wave distills a song for me,  
That rises in tune and sympathy;  
Thy beauty reminds me not to fear,  
Sweet moon, thy presence holds all near.
