There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
There is society where none intrudes,
By the deep sea, and music in its roar;
I love not man the less, but Nature more,
From these our interviews, in which I steal
From all I may be, or have been before,
To mingle with the Universe, and feel
What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.


Where the last view of the sea is lost,
A step away from where the doubt I bear,
And rolling hills conspire to toss,
With wildflowers, sacred and rare.


- George Gordon Lord Byron
