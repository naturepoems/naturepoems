Autumn Leaves

On the path of the garden,
yellow leaves
swirl in the dance of autumn.
They promise the ground
a slow embrace,
a forgotten symphony,
touched lightly by their fall.
A bittersweet scent,
a cradle of memory,
every rustle holds stories,
love and silence entwine
in the embrace of the bushel.
