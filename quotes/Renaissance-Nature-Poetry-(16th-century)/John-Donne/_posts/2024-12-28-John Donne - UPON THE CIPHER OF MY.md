UPON THE CIPHER OF MY MISTRESS

When first I saw that lovely face,
    So fair, but being that I was nothing,
I could not tell my heart, nor place,
    My light and fortune — so lost was I,
That to my soul should love have paid,
And that so well, my heart, crying cries.

And gentleness therein should stay,
    So tenderly she seems to learn.
Yet you scarce belong, if beauty, say,
    Longer than the warmest heart had burn’d:
With the breath of youth, you willed the best
    So good a creature hath its good part.

By each and every heart that’s dear,
    When, as I left, and dashed humble pride:
Instead, I made fragments of thy cheer.
    So now, can I remain resigned?
For one day to you hath sped and spent,
— As when besmirched, man hath removed,
    Can I could love when joy hath lent?

- John Donne
