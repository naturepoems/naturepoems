The sun is a great astrolabe  
That measures time for me;  
The shadows from the tree-tops weave  
Some song of certainty.  

A breeze slips through the fragrant pine  
And moves the meadow’s head;  
The stream, it bubbles through the line  
Where skies are soft with red.  

So God spins softly for each heart  
His tender world-degree;  
In joy and beauty we all part  
To love eternity.

- Joyce Kilmer
