The Road

I took a road that led away
From commons known and fields of green
Where winds both rough and breezy play,
To where the silence, strong and keen.

Is that the limestone—dusted pale—
Or is it clouds that ride the brow,
But breathing provides a soft, slow scale
Of life in this secluded vow?

Back then, where vision's grass held sway,
And opened nothing into bloom,
I left there for a world away,
Embraced the sweet beneath its loom.

— Edward Thomas
