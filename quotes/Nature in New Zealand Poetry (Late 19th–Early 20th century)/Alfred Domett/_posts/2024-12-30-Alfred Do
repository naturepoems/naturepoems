The Old Man of the Mountains

There stands a mountain tall and grand,
With jagged peaks that pierce the sea,
As if a sentinel, it keeps its stand,
And gazes down on men, like me.

The dusky pine-trees, tuneful, bright,
In verdant coats of evergreen,
Bathe in the golden morning light,
While clouds like spirits drift between.

The river winds, an azure band,
Through canyons deep and valleys wide,
It sings, it whispers, and takes its stand,
Reflecting nature’s grandeur, glorified.

Here nature reigns in pure delight,
While man does little else but mar;
Yet nature stands, in splendid height,
Our everlasting, guiding star.

Frosted Trees

In winter's chill, with frost so bright,
The trees stand cloaked in crystal white,
Their branches etched, like lace they show,
A masterpiece, adorned with snow.

Beneath a sunless, leaden sky,
In silence, all the creatures lie,
Yet nature's beauty paints the scene,
In hues of silver, soft and serene.

Oh, stillness here, in icy breath,
A peaceful pause before the death
Of winter’s grip, for soon shall break
The warmth of spring, and trees awake.

The Sea

The restless sea, with its emerald hue,
Churns and roars, with stories anew,
It dances gleefully upon the shore,
And whispers secrets, forevermore.

Beneath the waves, the fish they dart,
A world of wonders, a work of art,
The ocean’s heart beats steady and strong,
In harmony with nature's song.

When tempests rage and the waters rise,
The sea reveals its fierce disguise,
It's both a cradle and grave for lore,
A timeless force, forevermore.

A Summer Night

Upon the hill, 'neath starry skies,
The night unfolds in a sweet surprise,
The soft, sweet air, the fragrant bloom,
Unfolds its arms in twilight's room.

The owls they hoot, the crickets play,
While shadows stretch at the close of day,
In nature's theatre, the night takes flight,
A canvas painted in silver light.

Each breath of wind, a soft caress,
In this wild space, I find my rest,
The universe sings, in endless delight,
In the heart of a rich, summer night.

---

Beneath the Trees

Amidst the grove, where shadows lie,
And sunlight sifts from the endless sky,
I stroll through paths, where leaves converse,
In whispers sweet, the universe.

The branches arch, like arms in prayer,
As if they seek a blessing rare,
The dappled light, a golden kiss,
Turns ordinary moments into bliss.

Here nature breathes, with gentle grace,
Each corner turned, a wild embrace,
In the heart of woods, my troubles cease,
I find my solace, I find my peace.

Spring’s Awakening

When winter’s breath has fled the day,
And blossoms bloom in sweet array,
The earth, reborn, begins to sing,
A joyful song of awakening.

The tender shoots break through the ground,
With colors bright and scents profound,
While nature’s choir, in chorus sweet,
Welcomes the warmth, where life’s complete.

Oh, joyous spring, with promise true,
Each leaf and flower, fresh and new,
With every sunrise, we can see,
The pulse of life, forever free.

The Mountain Stream

A mountain stream, with laughter gay,
Is dancing, tumbling on its way,
It leaps o’er rocks, in merry flight,
A bubbling laughter, pure delight.

By mossy stones, it finds its bed,
In sunlight’s warmth, where fairy tread,
And all the world, in joyous gleam,
Is captured in this flowing dream.

The water sings a serenade,
Whilst nature’s wonders cascade,
In harmony, they weave their tale,
In every drop, the wind and veil.

---

The Quiet Garden

In quiet gardens, time stands still,
As petals fall and dew drops spill,
A symphony of scent and hue,
Where whispers float, as dreams come true.

The boughs, they droop with weighty fruit,
While butterflies in silence loot,
The colors dance, a vibrant game,
In nature’s pleasure, without shame.

Oh, tranquil space, so rich and rare,
With beauty crafted with the care,
Here, every moment blooms and grows,
In this sweet realm, where nature glows.

---

Silence of the Woods

In woodland depths, where silence reigns,
The rustling leaves, like soft refrains,
The trunk stands tall, in noble pride,
A witness to the world outside.

Yet here in shadows, solace grows,
In every whisper that the breeze bestows,
Nature's secrets softly shared,
In every eye, the world declared.

Oh, sanctuary, calm and bright,
In your embrace, the world feels right,
Forever cradled in your arms,
The silence here contains all charms.

---

The Evening Star

The evening star, a glimmering light,
Pierces the veil of coming night,
It hangs above the whispering trees,
Guiding us through memories.

In twilight's glow, the world transforms,
As night surrounds, with calming forms,
Each star above, a watchful friend,
A promise that the dark shall end.

With every twinkle, dreams align,
As shadows dance and stars entwine,
In this vast tapestry’s embrace,
The evening star our thoughts will trace.

---

To the River

Oh river, winding through the land,
With gentle curves so soft and grand,
You carry tales from shore to shore,
A liquid language, evermore.

In every ripple, memories hide,
Of laughter, tears, and time's swift tide,
You cradle life in your flowing arms,
In tranquil waters, spirit charms.

As day gives way to dusk’s sweet grace,
Your surface reflects a golden face,
In whispers of the evening breeze,
You are nature's song, her eternal peace.

---

In the Mist

The morning mist, a gauzy shroud,
That rises, soft, above the crowd,
And cloaks the earth in ghostly lace,
A fleeting dance, a gentle trace.

With every step, the world ignites,
As nature wakes in soft twilight,
The laughter of the day comes near,
In droplets kissed by morning's tear.

This magic veils the canvas wide,
In misty whispers, we confide,
For in this shroud, the world is new,
A wonder seen in every view.

---

Nocturne

When stars emerge, and shadows creep,
The world succumbs to quiet sleep,
Beneath the moon's soft, silver glare,
The heart of night lays itself bare.

Each rustle of the whispering trees,
In rhythmic tune, with gentle breeze,
The orchestra of night begins,
In nature’s realm, where stillness spins.

Oh, let me wander, lost in dreams,
Where time dissolves in silver streams,
In this nocturnal lullaby,
I find my peace, I learn to fly.

---

A Glistening Dawn

A dawn that breaks with blush and hue,
The world awakes, refreshed and new,
As shadows flee from light’s embrace,
And every flower finds its place.

The golden rays, like fingers soft,
Caress the earth, and lift aloft,
The hopes of day, so bright and clear,
In every heartbeat, nature’s cheer.

With every sunrise, dreams are spun,
In brilliance of the rising sun,
This glistening dawn becomes my muse,
In splendor bright, I cannot lose.
