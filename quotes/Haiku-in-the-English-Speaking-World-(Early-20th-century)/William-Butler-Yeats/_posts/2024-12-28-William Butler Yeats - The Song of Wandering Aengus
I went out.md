I went out"

author: William Butler Yeats
quote: "The Song of Wandering Aengus
I went out to the hazel wood,
Because a fire was in my head,
And I dug and I swallowed a berry white,
And I sat by a blackthorn tree;
And I picked and I ate a tree of silver,
And I sought it on the sea.

And I've gone to the days of clouds and cold,
The forests of night and deep,
And if you've not turned into ashes,
And let their little wings grow stronger,
Instead I have a girl's heart. 
Take me back to the green wilderness
And all my dreams of deer and thunder!

Then I will be your white deer,
Your quiet home in a fragrant field,
And I shall know if peace will follow
With the old man at the wheel. 
The true tale of both fates and fears
Will grace my days and shadow my fears."

The Song of Wandering Aengus
I went out to the hazel wood,
Because a fire was in my head,
And I dug and I swallowed a berry white,
And I sat by a blackthorn tree;
And I picked and I ate a tree of silver,
And I sought it on the sea.

And I've gone to the days of clouds and cold,
The forests of night and deep,
And if you've not turned into ashes,
And let their little wings grow stronger,
Instead I have a girl's heart. 
Take me back to the green wilderness
And all my dreams of deer and thunder!

Then I will be your white deer,
Your quiet home in a fragrant field,
And I shall know if peace will follow
With the old man at the wheel. 
The true tale of both fates and fears
Will grace my days and shadow my fears.

- William Butler Yeats
