In wildflower fields,
Where colors burst and blend,
A symphony of blossoms,
That seem to never end.

Each petal tells a story,
Of sunshine, rain, and hope,
In every vibrant hue,
Nature teaches us to cope.

Let us dance among the flowers,
With hearts both light and free,
For in this wild beauty,
We find our harmony.
