The Mountains  
At nightfall,  
The looming mountains  
Press their bodies  
Against the wind;  
They toss their dark hair,  
And the voices  
Of the ancient ones  
Sing with the currents  
Of the river below.  

I walk alone  
In shadows,  
Feeling the pulse  
Of the earth's breast,  
A landscape unheard,  
Veiled by an ocean of twilight,  
Where love and loss  
Collide fiercely  
With the after-dusk.  

And the night  
Takes me in,  
Hushes my cries  
In the warmth of longingâ€”  
Here, on the edge  
Of something eternal.

- David Gascoyne
