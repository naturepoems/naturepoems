The twilight glistens upon the grass,
The horizon blushes in crimson and gold,
And shadows stretch, as the day turns to pass,
Eclipsing the tales that the night will unfold.

Starry jewels adorn the darkened skies,
Their shimmer a language the nightbirds croon,
While the world finds dreams in the softest sighs
That flow through the spirit, a gentle tune.


- Bolesław Leśmian
