In Distrust of Merits

              The turtle lives

In a draughty little house,

The wind breathes softly—

Filling the shadows,

The phase of wings,

The speed of shadows at dawn,

            It runs and rushes through my thoughts,

A memory that stirs a pulse,

Like leaves against the stone. 


- Marianne Moore
