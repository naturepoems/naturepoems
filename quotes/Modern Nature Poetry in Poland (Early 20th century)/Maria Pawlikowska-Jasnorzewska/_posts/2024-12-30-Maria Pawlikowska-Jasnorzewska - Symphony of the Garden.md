In the heart of the garden,
a symphony of colour erupts.
Each bloom sings a song of joy,
a fragrant melody that enchants the air.

Butterflies flit from petal to petal,
a ballet of nature, light as air,
a celebration of life,
a reminder of the beauty that surrounds us,
if we only take the time to see.

Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
