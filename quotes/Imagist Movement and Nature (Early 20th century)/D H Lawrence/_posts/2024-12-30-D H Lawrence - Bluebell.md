Bluebell

   A'red that drifts among the ways,
   And low swaying in the green,
   A bluebell stands alone, it foils,
   A shimmering trick of light-between.

   It lingers where the wood bends deep,
   Spying other blooms in kiss, or male,
   Yet still it flights its azure wings,
   To spin and impressâ€”to yet prevail.
   The light takes on a ghostly hue,
   In the hang of petals down the isle
   And dragonflies awaken in pools
   While bees chime muffled to the still.  
   


- D H Lawrence
