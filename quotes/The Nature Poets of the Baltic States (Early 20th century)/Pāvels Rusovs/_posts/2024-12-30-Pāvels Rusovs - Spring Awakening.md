In spring's tender waking,
When the world bursts into song,
Joyful colors awaken,
And the air is thick with promise,
Life rings out in vibrant hues.

Petals unfurl like laughter,
Dancing in the warm embrace,
As nature paints her canvas,
With strokes of love and wonder,
In the season of rebirth's grace.
