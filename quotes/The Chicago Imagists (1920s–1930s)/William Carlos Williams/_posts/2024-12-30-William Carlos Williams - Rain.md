Rain

The rain

is a finger,  
a true

stream of golden hue

on noonday.

And it is that touch

no-made heart

that we love, love.

Oh how it flows
the unshaken column,

the light from every side

as we step into love.

Long summer,
the eternal touch,

moist, warm,
how it makes life wide.

- William Carlos Williams
