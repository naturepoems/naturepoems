Song for a Dark Girl

Way down south in Alabama
I had a dream.

I dreamed I saw the world,
A world without pain,
Where trees shone like gold,
Under the light of love.

In my dream, the moon shone brightly
And everything turned to earth
In the burning fire of day.

But the sun rose too soon,
And my dream was gone,
Like shadows fleeing at noon.

- Langston Hughes
