The stream runs down to the sea,  
   it runs like a needle passing  
   through the eye of a needle,  
   it runs like the sun  
   through the branches of a tree,  
   like the storm,  
   riding between the mountains,  
   crashing down  
   in the crevices of a rock,  
   it runs, it runs, it runs.
