To a Skylark
Hail to thee, blithe Spirit!
Bird thou never wert—
That from Heaven or near it
Pourest thy full heart

In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.
Higher still and higher
From the earth thou springest
Like a cloud of fire;
The blue deep thou wingest,

And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
In the golden light
Half hidden in the sun,
Skip as a lark in flight,
Laughing and dancing on—

Thou art not lost; behold!
Through the world roam free,
And in its joy behold.
Thy nest in the sky.


- Percy Bysshe Shelley
