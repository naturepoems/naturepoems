The autumn leaves fall crisp and bright,
An offering to earth’s embrace,
While nature dons her robes of night
To welcome winter’s softest grace.

And in this time, my heart finds bliss,
With every pulse a softer glow,
For in this fading day’s sweet kiss,
The cycle of life begins to show.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
