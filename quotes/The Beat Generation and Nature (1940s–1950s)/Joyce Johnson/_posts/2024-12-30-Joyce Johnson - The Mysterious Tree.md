Here is the mysterious tree,
a gigantic presence, tree of life
                        and eavesdropping leaves,
like a silent witness in the night.
The air thick with shadows
beneath its whispering branches.

    What stories it might tell
of winds that danced through its crown,
of birds that nested in its heart,
life swirling around its roots,
secrets that only the ground knows.

- Joyce Johnson
