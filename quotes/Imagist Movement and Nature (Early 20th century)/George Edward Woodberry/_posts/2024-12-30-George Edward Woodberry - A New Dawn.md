Upon the hills, the sun shall rise,
To bath the woods in golden blaze,
With flames of joy that fill the skies,
And greet the dawn with endless praise.

A song of life through every vale,
The earth awakens in her guise,
As chirping breezes deftly sail,
And lift my heart in morningâ€™s prize.

- George Edward Woodberry
