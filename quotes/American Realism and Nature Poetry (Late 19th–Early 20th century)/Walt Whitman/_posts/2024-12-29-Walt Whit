O to be alive,  
In the full flush of the dawn,  
To feel each breath awaken in the light,  
The softness, the clarity, the beauty,  
Is it not sublime?  
I roam this vivid landscape,  
Through valleys, fields, and skies alive,  
Letting my spirit glide,  
As the new day is born.  

The lark lifts its voice,  
And fills the air with clear song,  
Nature's anthem of joy,  
In harmony, we too, belong.  

—From "O to Be Alive"

- Walt Whitman
