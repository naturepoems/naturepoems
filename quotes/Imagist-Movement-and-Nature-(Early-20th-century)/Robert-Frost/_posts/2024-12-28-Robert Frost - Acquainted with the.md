Acquainted with the Night

I have been one acquainted with the night.
I have walked out in rainâ€”and back in rain.
I have outwalked the furthest city light.

I have looked down the saddest city lane,
I have passed by the watchman on his beat
And dropped my eyes, unyielding as stone,

I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
When far away an interrupted cry
Came over houses from another street,

But not to call me back or say good-bye;
And further still at an unearthly height,
One luminary clock against the sky

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.
I have been one acquainted with the night.

- Robert Frost
