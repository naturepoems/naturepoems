A Winter Night

On a winter night when the stars are bright,
The frosty breath of the quiet air,
Whispers softly of the fading light,
Enfolding the world with a wintry care.

The moon hangs low in a velvet sky,
Casting shadows on the crystal snow,
Where footprints of foxes roam and fly,
And the trees are draped in a silvery glow.

Silent whispers fill the chilly night,
With the crackle of wood in the warming hearth,
Nature holds her breath in the spell of light,
While the world sighs deep in its soft rebirth.


- Mary Webb
