Felix Randal

The careful marjory of Mr. Felix,  
Fleecy in a blast of thought ascends  
And seems to win no end; no curve nor arrow  
Mend the face awake that end of midst new light.
  
And the last of those good done as to creed  
Is the soft cloth of care laid down, thus depend,
Upon claim’s fallen strokes that pounded deep; thus mend.

— Gerard Manley Hopkins
