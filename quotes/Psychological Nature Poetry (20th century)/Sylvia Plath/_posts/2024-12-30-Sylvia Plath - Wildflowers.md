The wild flowers,
                      In their blue,
   Dance lightly,
         In fields of gold,
  As if the sun
             Were a friend,
Shining down
        With laughter,
                   And warmth.

        Their colors, 
      A chorus, 
     Singing softly,
To the breeze.
     They whisper
  Secrets of the heart,  
In the silence of the landscape,
          Beneath a sky,
              Open, wide.

- Sylvia Plath
