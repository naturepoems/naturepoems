The Butterfly

A butterfly dances, light as air,  
   On petals bright with morning dew,  
   A fleeting glimpse springs sweet and rare,  
   Nature whispers in colors new.

Every flutter tells a tale,  
   Of seasons turning, life renewed,  
   From earth to sky, a blushing veil,  
   The gift of life in every mood.
