Clouds drift lazily,
Beneath a pale blue sky,
Like boats on a sea of air.
I sit and watch the shadows play,
As the sun dips low.

The world is still,
Only the breeze makes a sound,
Caressing leaves and blades of grass,
A symphony of nature’s breath,
Whispering life into the stillness.

I close my eyes and dream,
Beneath this vast expanse,
Each breath a part of the earth,
In the embrace of sky and field,
A moment frozen in time.

- Richard Wright
