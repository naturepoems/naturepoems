Mountains rise, their silent power,
While clouds hug the hills in embrace,
A dance of nature, hour by hour,
A sacred, timeless, breathing space.
For under every star that glows,
Lies the rhythm of life that grows,
In every shadow, a story told,
Of love and loss in the soft, soft gold.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
