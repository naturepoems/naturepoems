The Silent Snow
As winter drapes her cloak of white,
A hush falls soft across the land,
In crystal silence, pure delight,
Nature pauses, oh so grand.

Footprints mark the path we tread,
In frozen dreams, the world is still,
In every flake, a world is fed,
In quiet magic, hearts we fill.

- Aldona Gustava
