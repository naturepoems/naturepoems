The autumn leaves in colors bold,
Dance upon the breeze so cold.
A tapestry of loss and gain,
Declares the cycle, joy and pain.

The earth prepares for winter's sleep,
While memories of summer we keep.
In the chill of dawn, life exhales,
Each breath a story, history trails.

Yet in this fading light, I see,
A promise of spring that waits for me.
For nature knows, it never ends,
In every season, the heart mends.


- Juliusz Słowacki
