To the Rainbow
Tender arch! thou art well designed—  
To give soft radiance to the mind:  
And when thro' heavy clouds thou art seen,  
Thy hues bewitching the murky green  
Of the shower-nurtured vale;  
Thy beauty hath a voice, and doth prevail.

Oft have I wander'd, day by day,  
In childhood’s time, on sunny way;  
I sought thee o’er the velvet plain,  
And, brood'd beneath the trees, in vain  
I gazed with little pride,  
To see thee dim, and gently glide  
Beyond dark storm and summer shower,  
Within the soft yet fleeting hour.

- Charlotte M Smith
