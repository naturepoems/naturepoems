At the break of dawn,
Nature wakes me with laughter,
Every chirp a greeting,
Every bloom a blessing,
The soft kiss of morning dew,
Preserving dreams from the night.
As the sun leaps into the day,
I too rise, inspired—
To stretch, to breathe,
To join the confluence of life.

               – From "Morning Awakening"
