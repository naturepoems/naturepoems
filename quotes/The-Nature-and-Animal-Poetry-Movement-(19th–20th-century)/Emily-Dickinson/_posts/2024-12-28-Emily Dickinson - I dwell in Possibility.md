I dwell in Possibility —
A fairer House than Prose —
More numerous of Windows —
Superior — for Doors —

Of Chambers as the Cedars —
Impregnable of Eye —
And honored — in the Cluster —
The Crowning — of the Sky —

My Happiness is the Stream,
It's Weeds and Waters — plain —
So I could find an entry —
In my dear sylvan domain —

- Emily Dickinson
