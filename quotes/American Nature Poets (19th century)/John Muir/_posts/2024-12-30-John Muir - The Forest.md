The Forest

In the heart of the forest, a whispering sound,  
Nature’s song in the rippling brook;  
Where ancient trees in solemnity stand,  
And shadows provide the pages of a book.

Each leaf tells a tale, of seasons gone by,  
The cicadas sing, and the owls keep watch;  
As night falls softly and the moon sails high,  
Life weaves its patterns, never to botch.

Let me wander, my spirit at ease,  
Through the emerald labyrinth, green and profound;  
Where every step echoes ‘neath towering trees,  
In the heart of the forest, where I am unbound.
