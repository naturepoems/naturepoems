The Riverbed

Softly the river weaves its way,
Through pebbles and sands in bright ballet,
A mirror of sky in its liquid flow,
Reflecting the world in a gentle glow.

It carries life on its flowing back,
Birds above and fish in its track,
A journey shared, a bond so rare,
In nature’s embrace, we find our fare.

- David C Okwuosa
