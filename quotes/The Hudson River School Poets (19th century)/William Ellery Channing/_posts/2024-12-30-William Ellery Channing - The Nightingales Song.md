A nightingale sings through the night,  
In melodies both soft and clear,  
Its notes take flight on moon's pale light,  
And fill the heart with love and cheer.  

In every song, the stars do shine,  
Reminding us of beauty's glow,  
In nature's arms, our spirits entwine,  
In every note, the world we know.

- William Ellery Channing
