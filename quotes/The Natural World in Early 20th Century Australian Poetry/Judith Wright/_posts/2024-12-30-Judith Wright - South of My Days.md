South of My Days

The land lies
Wide on either side
Of the silver river,
The green flowing reaches,
Under the trees
They whisper of the past,
Of the ages that went ahead,
Under the skirts of night,
Mother of dream.

And to the south, they say,
Lay the old paths
Where the dust of the days falls,
The sound of the skyâ€™s laughter
Like wind in the long grass,
Like water against stone.


- Judith Wright
