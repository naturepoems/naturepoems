Swirling above, crafting stories unseen,
And when they burst, they nourish the ground—
Life begins anew with each drop of rain."

Clouds gather like thoughts in a busy mind,
Swirling above, crafting stories unseen,
And when they burst, they nourish the ground—
Life begins anew with each drop of rain.
