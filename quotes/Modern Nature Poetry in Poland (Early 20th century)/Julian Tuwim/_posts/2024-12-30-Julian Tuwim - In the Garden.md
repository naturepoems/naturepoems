In the garden, petals open,
Colors swirling in midair,
Bees hum in a soft choir,
Fluttering near blooms with care.
A whisper of spring caressing
The earth waking from winter's hold,
Every bud sings a promise,
A tale of beauty, bold.

Here lies the cradle of life,
Where the garden blooms eternal,-
In the symphony of the wild,
Nature's song is universal.

- Julian Tuwim
