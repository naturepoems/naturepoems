The Sea
The sea is a child;
She waits for us to come,
From the heights above,
Where the stars prevail
In the echoes of waves.

The seashells carry memories,
When the tides leave their mark,
Scattered as we step,
Caressing the shores of our hands.
No sound, nor voice obeys,
In the open air discovery.


- Ezra Pound
