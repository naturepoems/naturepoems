Beneath the sheltering oak tree,
Where shadows play in light,
I found a world so wondrous,
In nature’s pure delight.

The rustle of the leaves,
A symphony of sighs,
Whispered tales of ages,
Underneath the skies.

Nature's love is endless,
In every branch and flower,
A presence so transcendent,
Filled with quiet power.

Each moment I am grateful,
For breath and sight and sound,
In the embrace of nature,
Where all is truly found.

- David Garnett
