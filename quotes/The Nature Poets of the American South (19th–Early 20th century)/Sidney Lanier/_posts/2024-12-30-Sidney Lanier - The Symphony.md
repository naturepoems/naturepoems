The Symphony
I am the poet, with a heart,
  That hears the song of the sea,
The deep bass of the waves that part
  And weave in harmony with me.

The tempests break upon the shore,
  The summits sing their echoes hoarse;
I hear them raise, and the winds implore,
  And dance as waves of the night’s discourse.

And midst the roar and rush of time,
  A pulsing vibrato thrums my frame;
I join the beauty of the chime
  And pour my self into the flame.

- Sidney Lanier
