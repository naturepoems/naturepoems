The Cradle of the Wild

In one light hour I learned all things
Which in the long days of my youth,
Dreams of the world have spoken sweetly;
Nothing of gladness remaineth pure.

For joy is an echo in the stillness,
The silence of my very heart,
No word can speak, nor song can tell,
What-loving Nature bears apart.

- John G Whittier
