I dwell in Possibility—  
A fairer House than Prose—  
More numerous of Windows—  
Superior—for Doors—  

Narrower for Doorways—  
More numerous of ways—  
And every time I step outside—  
You lay without your way—  

To cease from Nature's Laws  
Then Solemn there at Dusk—  
I kept a little house where  
Elizabeth is  
And she will stay—  

At Home—at Home by Twilight  
Deep down at Parting Time—  
My Playground—  
Where I shall play  
When I am Void of Duty—  

And nothing but a Wind will say!  


- Emily Dickinson
