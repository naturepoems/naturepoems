On the Grasshopper and Cricket
The poetry of earth is never dead:
   When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,
And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run
   From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;
That is the grasshopper's—he takes the lead
   In summer luxury, he has never done
   With his delights; for when tired from fun,
He rests at ease beneath some shady weed.

The poetry of earth is ceasing never;
   And when the new year comes, and the night is clear,
And the cold, and every path and crying stream,
There lives a peace in autumn's sunny weather;  

   Though in many a noble form should it hover
   Away from weary, weary paths, from forest phantoms;  

And still with silence end the long year—
   Who mourn for deeper shades and haunt but what scare!

Thus, calm be all things, and gently show you beauty too;
   As everywhere every shade hath gleams and streams,
As this truth comprehends:
   1. The things we taste,
   2. The things we see and hear,
   3. Beware! be clever, too,
And keep not disapproving ears!

- John Keats
