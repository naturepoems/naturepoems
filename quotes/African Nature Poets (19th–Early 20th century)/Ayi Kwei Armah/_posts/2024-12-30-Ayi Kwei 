In the heart of the jungle, the whispers grow,
As the canopy sways in a rhythmic dance,
Roots entangled in a story untold,
Nature’s pulse, a magical trance.

The colors burst like laughter in spring,
A celebration of life in every bloom,
In every rustle, every crackle and snap,
Nature cradles us in her womb.

- Ayi Kwei Armah
