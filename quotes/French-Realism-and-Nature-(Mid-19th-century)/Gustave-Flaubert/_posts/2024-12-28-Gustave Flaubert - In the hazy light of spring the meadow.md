In the hazy light of spring, the meadow blooms,
Each blossom opening like a timid heart,
With delicate hues, sweet fragrance, and whispers,
Nature dons her green attire, a work of art.

Birds chirp a gentle serenade,
As the brook babbles a soft refrain,
The wind carries tales from the forest,
Where gentle shadows hide the earthâ€™s pain.

- Gustave Flaubert
