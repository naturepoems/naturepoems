A Summer Night

O hush’d and queit is the amber glow,  
Where nightingales break forth their strain,  
And breathe their songs to the moons unchained—  
Though shadows pass, each bird doth go.  
Take our flight down where echoes weave;  
To dance in currents of leafy glow;  
While breathing joys fleet through the leaves,  
Sounds carried to where dewdrops flow.  

Let me bring unto a land unseen,  
As clover blooms would meet the sun;  
Fair nectar glows so sweet, so green,  
Where endless tales of night are spun.  
Alas—yet as daylight breaks with light—  
Let me dwell within joy’s revel calls,  
And while the wind wanders softly bright,  
The thickets weave where heaven falls!  

Shall time and hours drift away from skies,  
And stretch the time within the woods of glee;  
To taste the nectar of love’s sweet lies  
In melody's breath eternally.


- Matthew Arnold
