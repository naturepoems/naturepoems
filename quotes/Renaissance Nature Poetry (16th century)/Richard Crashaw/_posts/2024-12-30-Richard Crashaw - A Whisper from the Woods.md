A Whisper from the Woods  
O whisper of the woodlands deep,  
Thy secret held in rustle found,  
A silent promise mine to keep,  
In shadows cast upon the ground.

Fair things emerge, like dreams untold,  
The echoing boughs with laughter ring,  
In every shade, a piece of gold,  
In every breeze, a songbird’s wing.

Thy branches cradle evening’s grace,  
Each leaf a note in nature’s hymn,  
Through tangled roots, a gentle trace  
Of love, of life, of light so dim.

O whisper, thy tales I shall not shun,  
For in thy depths, this heart finds peace,  
In wild embraces, my spirit runs,  
Through woods of wonder, my joys increase.

- Richard Crashaw
