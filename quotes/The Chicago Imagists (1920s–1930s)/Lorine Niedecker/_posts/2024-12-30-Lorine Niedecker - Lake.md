Lake

The lake is still,
     a mirror of blue stillness,
     fringed with soft grasses,
           the droplets blaze.
A heron stands, 
    poised and lunging,
    surrounding ripples engulfed,
    the beneath-murky mirageend.
Sky bends down,
    keeps silent secrets 
         and the lake listens. 
With patient regard and soft rhythm—
    life becomes a symphony in repose.
