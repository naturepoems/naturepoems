In rugged fields of dynamism,
Where colors explode like fireworks,
The trees are giants of silver,
Against the roar of time, they stand.

Fire burns through the woods,
A dance of beauty and ferocity,
Leaves shatter like glass,
Revealing a world of fractals.

Up above, the heavens arch,
Like vast machines crafting galaxies,
Dizzying, swirling, twist upon twist,
An orchestra of electric wonders!  

Let us run into the arms of the forest,
Calm, yet crackling with strength,
Beneath the milky cosmic gaze,
Where clay and steel become one.

- FT Marinetti
