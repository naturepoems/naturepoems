At the corner of the street
of the street
of the street
of Dogwood and Sycamore

I met the tree
and the open air.

I watched the leaves
blowing in the wind,
the clouds of the blue sky,
the soft green grass,
and the light
of the sun.

I laughed.

There is no end to the delight
of nature.

- William Carlos Williams
