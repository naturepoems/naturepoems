In the early light of morning,
When the dew rests gently upon the earth,
I bow before the beauty of small things—
A fragile flower’s blush,
The intricate dance of insect wings;
Here, I am reminded of the strength it takes
To emerge from darkness, the comfort found
In embracing the warmth of each new dawn,
And I stand rooted, like the ancient trees,
Listening to their wisdom sung in whispers,
Bearing witness as life insists again to rise,
Eternal, in the air that breathes, swells, and sighs.

— "Morning Dew"
