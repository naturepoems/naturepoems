In the stillness of twilight,
When day meets night in embrace,
Fireflies wink like distant stars,
While the moon begins her ascent,
To light the path of quiet dreams.

The symphony of crickets plays,
A soothing balm for aching souls,
As shadows loom and linger,
In the dance of evening's hues,
Where nature's secrets lie unveiled.
