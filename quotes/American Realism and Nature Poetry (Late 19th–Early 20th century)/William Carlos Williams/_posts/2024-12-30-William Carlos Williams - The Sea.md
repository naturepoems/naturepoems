The Sea

The sea lies still.

On quiet grey,

the waves fall back

as the hair,
nothing raping the beach.

Soft echo upon

soft, as the sound

from the trains
in cells of grains,

downward falls every wave

calm when it speaks; it draws

the eyes upon the sand,

and as dumb lawns
open beneath thin skies.

- William Carlos Williams
