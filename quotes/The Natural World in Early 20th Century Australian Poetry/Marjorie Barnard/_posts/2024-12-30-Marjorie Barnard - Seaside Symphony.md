The ocean’s ebb, the shore it greets,
With whispers soft upon the sand,
Each wave a story, new it meets,
And pulls at time with gentle hand.

Where tides of life rise, swell and fall,
A dance that binds the sea to shore;
In rhythm’s grace, we hear the call,
Of endless life forevermore.

- Marjorie Barnard
