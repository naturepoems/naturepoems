To the River  
Flowing river, rushing bright,  
With silver streams that tangle free,  
Thou carryâ€™st dreams into the night,  
And weave thy tale, eternally.

From mountain heights, thou dost descend,  
Through valleys lush, where fortunes lie,  
In every bend, thy pathways wend,  
An endless journey to the sky.

O water clear, reflecting stars,  
Whispering secrets lost and won,  
Your tranquil breath can ease my scars,  
In your embrace, I find the sun.

So sing, O Stream, thy sweet refrain,  
Through time and space shall flow our woes,  
In harmony, we drown our pain,  
And find the peace that nature owes.

- Richard Crashaw
