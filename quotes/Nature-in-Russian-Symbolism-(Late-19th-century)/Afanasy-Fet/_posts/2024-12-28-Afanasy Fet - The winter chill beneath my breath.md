The winter chill beneath my breath,  
The snowflakes dance on frosty air,  
In nature’s grasp, I’m born anew,  
Each flake, a dream, a silent prayer.  

The frozen streams, like silken lace,  
Are draped across the frozen ground,  
In quietude, I find my space,  
In crystal worlds where peace is found.
