The Solitary Road

Along the path where few have trod,
Where silence reigns, where few applaud,
Nature cradles all in her hand,
With every step, each grain of sand.

Whispers on the gentle breeze,
Carried forth through tall, firm trees,
Find your peace, reflect, and roam,
In solitude, discover home.

- John Burroughs
