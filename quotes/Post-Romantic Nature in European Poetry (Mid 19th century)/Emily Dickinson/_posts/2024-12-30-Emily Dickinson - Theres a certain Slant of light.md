There’s a certain Slant of light,  
Winter afternoons –  
That lifts the Veil of my despair  
And holds me — still in Stun —  

I can not process what it means  
To feel my heartless pain,  
As Nature’s shadows dance around  
And leave me cold and wan —  

Yet still a tiny spark ignites  
And flickers in the dark —  
A breath of Hope, a breath of Life  
That breathes at every mark —

- Emily Dickinson
