In the quiet of the night,
Under the blanket of stars,
The moon dips low,
Kissing the sleeping earth.

With a silver touch,
It awakens all that breathes,
The crickets sing,
And shadows softly weave.

The night is a canvas,
Painted with dreams,
And nature holds the brush,
In delicate, gentle schemes.
