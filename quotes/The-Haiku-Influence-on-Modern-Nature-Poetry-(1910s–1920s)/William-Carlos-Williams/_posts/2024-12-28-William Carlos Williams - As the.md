As the sky

turns deeper

into blue, so does

the surface of

the water turn

a reflection long

and bright as life itself.

A swan glides, swan

of quiet elegance,

through to the edge

of the reeds standing,

tall, still, watching,

but only the sun knows

where the world ends.

- William Carlos Williams
