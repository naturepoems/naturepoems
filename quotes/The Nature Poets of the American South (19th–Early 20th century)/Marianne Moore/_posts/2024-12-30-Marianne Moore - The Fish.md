The Fish
I caught a tremendous fish
  and held him beside the boat
   half out of water, with my hook
    fast in a corner of his mouth.
He didn’t open his eyes
   and he didn’t, and he didn’t
    swim away.

The tadpoles in the barrow
   were all gathered around the body
    below the ripples and I stood
     beside you, ultimately, good.

I am looking for a thought and I am fishing
   for the fish that is not a thought, but poetry
there in the water, swimming through
   its transparent glow.

The scales were like shards of broken
   glass in the sun, the way
    the light cut through him,
     and I could see the world's reflection
      there, under the waves.
  
This would make a good way
     to spend the day,
       caught between the sea
         and all of this blue sky.

And it is certainly less of the mind
   without any thought of killing
      or dying, but of a catch,
        a word, a fish,
        and beauty to go around.


- Marianne Moore
