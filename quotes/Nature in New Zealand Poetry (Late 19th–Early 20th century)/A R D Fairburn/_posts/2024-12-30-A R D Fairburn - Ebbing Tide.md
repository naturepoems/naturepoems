Ebbing Tide

The sea pulls back, a slow retreat,
A whispered parting from the shore,
And in the distance, soft and sweet,
The call of waves sings evermore.

With every ebb, a promise lingers,
Nature’s breath, in endless time,
In tides and currents, life still fingers,
A rhythm deep like ancient rhyme.


- A R D Fairburn
