The Voice

Woman: ‘If I could see you in the shadow
Of the hill beside my house, where we played
In daylight long ago.’

Man: ‘But do you not recall—
There came a winged being there,
Full with the stormy air?’

In autumn the earth flowed brown and gold,
The twigs all striped upon the verge
Among the trees a lonely lonely sigh;
That was that superhuman pledge, I swear,
Past all the dark woods bore my letter’s word.

And may the moon peep hence to climb on high!

- Thomas Hardy
