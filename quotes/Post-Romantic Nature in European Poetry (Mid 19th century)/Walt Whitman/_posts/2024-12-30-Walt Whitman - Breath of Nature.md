To breathe the air, a blessing pure,
To walk on soil, where life does stir,
With skies like palettes, laced with hue,
Each moment sings of nature true.

From mountains vast to rivers wide,
The flow of life, in currents abide,
In rustling leaves and chirping song,
Nature cradles us, where we belong.

So cherish the simple, the great, the small,
In every whisper, hear the call,
For in the heart of the earth, we find,
A solace that sings to all humankind.

- Walt Whitman
