The Battle of the Birds

I heard the fight of the birds, 
Their wings smote the air 
With whistlings and cries, 
And their wild disturbed motions, 
Circling and darting, fraught 
With the frenzy of wing, shattering the sun,  
Through thickest green, through the scent of the trees, 

Fates of Summer, their fates! 
I saw their tiny things drift 
Like leaves towards the grass, 
With such a frenzy of edged air, 
Flesh of feathers! Gone, and 
Fates of Summer, their fates!

- Lesbia Harford
