The Sea Rose

   All down the desolate coast
   I heard a rose of the sea
   Piping its little song,
   Its thin, clear voice,
   Like a mere reed, cast on the wavering shore.
   It sang of youth and hope,
   Of the breath of a hundred winds,
   Of the dark hues, the phantoms,
   The quiet shadows of the earth,
   The sea-roots of timeâ€™s revenge.

   Let me run my fingers
   Through your wild, tangled hair,
   As I listen to the rose of the sea;  
   The lapping waves faintly intone,

- HD Hilda Doolittle
