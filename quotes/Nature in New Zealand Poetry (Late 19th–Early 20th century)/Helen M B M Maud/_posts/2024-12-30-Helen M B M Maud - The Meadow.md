The Meadow

In verdant fields, where daisies sway,
The meadow sings a symphony;
With colors bright, and light at play,
A tapestry of harmony.

Each blade of grass, a whisper soft,
In gentle gusts, the breezes hum;
Where nature’s heart beats high aloft,
And every soul doth welcome come.

So wander here, find peace in green,
In nature’s vast, embrace your dreams;
For in this space, felt yet unseen,
The meadow holds our truest themes.

- Helen M B M Maud
