The Spring

Awaken, kindred spirit,
for spring approaches with the dawn,
in every petal unfurlingâ€”
a promise drawn.

The fragrance of new life,
carried within the breeze,
reminds us of beginnings,
unwrites the past with ease.

Clad in colors bright,
dappled sunlight smiling free,
may we rise from shadows,
and dance, unchained, by the sea.

Rainer Maria Rilke
