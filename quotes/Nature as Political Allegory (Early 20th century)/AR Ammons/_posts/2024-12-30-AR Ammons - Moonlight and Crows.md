The moon wakes late, peeking
through the shroud of trees.
Pine needles glimmer in
silver light. Ideas float
down like leaves, ideas urgently shifting.

The crows callâ€”a heavy echo
in mist, sunlight absent.
I consider my place
down here among the tangled roots,
where stories curl and coil,
sustained by earth's warmth.
