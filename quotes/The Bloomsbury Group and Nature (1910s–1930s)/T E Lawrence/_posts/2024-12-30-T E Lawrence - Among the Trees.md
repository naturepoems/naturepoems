Behold the trees, so proud and tall,
   That sway beneath the whispered breeze,
   They beckon to the world to pause,
   To find the heart amidst the leaves.

   With branches reaching out to dreams,
   They gather stories yet untold,
   Each ring a year, a love, a tear,
   As seasons turn to shades of gold.

   Beneath their shade, time folds in grace,
   A sanctuary whispers low,
   Where nature's realm, a warm embrace,
   Invites the soul to slowly grow.

- T E Lawrence
