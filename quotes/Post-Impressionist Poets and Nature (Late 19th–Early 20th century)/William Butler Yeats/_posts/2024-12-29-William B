Song of the Happy Shepherd

Shepherds all, and maidens fair,
You that wander everywhere,
Come and wander with me!
Come, I'll sing the happy song
Tra-la-la, for the dance along,
Let your hearts be free!

With my pipe and merry tune,
Joy must flower into June,
Blisters like a bounteous tree:
Come and dance the merry round,
While the glee flits all around,
In the songs that we shall see!

Hark, the voices shout and cheer,
And the shadows dance up here,
Shining through the trees so free.
Sisters all, 'tis now the time
To frolic free in my sweet rhyme,
For we are shrouded near the sea!

- William Butler Yeats
