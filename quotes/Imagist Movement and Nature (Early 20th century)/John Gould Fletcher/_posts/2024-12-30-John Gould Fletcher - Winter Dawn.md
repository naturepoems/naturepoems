Winter Dawn
Pale is the dawn with a chill in its heart,
The bare trees stand like silent ghosts,
While frost clings white to every shape,
In the stillness of the waking world.
The sun rises slow as a thought,
Touching the cold ground with hesitant warmth,
Each beam a shimmer of promised hope,
Melting the night, bringing forth day.


- John Gould Fletcher
