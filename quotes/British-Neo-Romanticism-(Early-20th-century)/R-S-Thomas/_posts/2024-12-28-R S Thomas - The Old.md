The Old Trees

Old trees 
     will not hide 
     their scars;  
your thick undergrowth,  
a brambled preach,  
     holds legends of 
     winter winds, 
     fragments of shadow.

O silent sentinels, 
stripped of any pomp,  
     you stagger 
     now with the years,
     wear sagging pages,
pressed all over with light,
     that lifts from your trunks 
     the whispers of silence.

When the sun flows 
     with your flesh, 
lost in rootsâ€™ embrace 
     and thought,  
I find my way  
     to the heavens,  
     and listen for your voice.

- R S Thomas
