Mountain's Call

High upon the rugged crest,  
Where eagles soar and shadows rest.  
The mountain whispers ancient tales,  
Of storms that roared and quiet gales.
  
In every stone, in every stream,  
A spirit lives; a vibrant dream.  
Wisdom wrapped in nature's fold,  
The mountain's heart, a tale retold.


- Halfred Lee
