THE FLOWER CARNIVAL

Now in the carnival of bloom  
When each flower’s every eye  
Is filled with the color and the plume,  
The earth laughs out in glee.

And all the fragrances unfold  
That soft young fingers mold;  
So truly will beauty dance in time  
When wrapped in all things free.

They come from the ether fair and bright,  
Together we meet and see;  
With our bright moods of life and light  
The colors ring with glee!
