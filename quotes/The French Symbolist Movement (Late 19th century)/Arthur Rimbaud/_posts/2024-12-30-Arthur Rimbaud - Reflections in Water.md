Rippling waters cast reflections,
Of sky and blossoms, of joy and peace;
In the heart of a tranquil river,
All worries fade, and sorrows cease.

Overhead, the lark sings sweetly,
A melody of freedom and flight;
With each ripple and each soft note,
Nature unfolds her purest light.

Let us linger where the water flows,
In the dance of life, in gentle grace;
For in these rippling reflections,
We find ourselves in natureâ€™s embrace.

- Arthur Rimbaud
