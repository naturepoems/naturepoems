The Fiddler of Dooney
When I play on my fiddle in Dooney,
Folk dance like a wave of the sea;
Or, when I at the lady in Dooney
Use sorrows, or breaks over me.

In the back of the burlap-bag, my sorrow
Is trampled by what the soft raindrops bring;
Over the hills, where I play like a shadow,
And pull at my strings for her echo to sing.

O, the highest voice flows through those whose marrow
Is trembled by love’s serenities,
With a bloom of the orchard and fields to follow,
A burden of beauty, and laughter’s glee.

- William Butler Yeats
