The tree the apple takes on the first  
Of the spring of autumn in the sun  
Leads to a branch deep in the summer air  
With one unmortal thought beneath its burrow,  
With shade and shadows and wildflower mow.  

This will not outlast the sowing of the year  
By fall and winter and spring’s fault.  
The second reaching for its harvesting  
Will drown until the nethermost breath  
Of land of life with flower-set sun can say  
There is a garden gold among the weeds  
With your heart as child’s in the sun.

- Robert Frost
