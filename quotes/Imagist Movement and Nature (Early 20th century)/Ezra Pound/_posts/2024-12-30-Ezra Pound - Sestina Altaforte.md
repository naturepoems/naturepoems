Sestina: Altaforte
O, as we may have done it, through you
Have the mountains echo
Upon the time of its way,
Good dreams—under the shadows.
Gently from the spirit grows pale sweet flower,
Heard from afar in knees deep in the vale's hold;
Lo! I strike the deep seed
And collect life near the skies!
A field of laughter and turn in the fire
Unseen, unknowable, the spirit swells,
In our hearts refill a race:
Let us love onward as I twine.
Through dawn with mixture and heavy dew!
Mayeyep—across the realms of rooted earth.

- Ezra Pound
