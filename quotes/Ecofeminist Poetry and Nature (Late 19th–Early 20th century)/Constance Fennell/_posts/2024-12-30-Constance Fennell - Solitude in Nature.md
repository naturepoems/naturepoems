Solitude in Nature

In the lone woods where the tangled boughs,
  Intertwine with shadows, whispers soft, and coy,
  There dwells a grace that wraps my heart with vows,
  A bond with silence ne’er to break, nor destroy.

The streamlet calls with laving, deep delight,
  And leads me onward in its gentle dance,
  Each ripple whispers tales of day and night,
  While sunbeams play a merry game of chance.

The wildflowers blush beneath the whispering trees,
  Who dream of all the wonders life unveils,
  And show their joy upon the summer's breeze,
  As Nature weaves her healthful, sweet regales.

Fain I would linger ‘neath these beldams fair,
  With nature’s soft caress my soul entwined,
  For in this solitude, I breathe the rare
  Refreshment that awakens all mankind.

- Constance Fennell
