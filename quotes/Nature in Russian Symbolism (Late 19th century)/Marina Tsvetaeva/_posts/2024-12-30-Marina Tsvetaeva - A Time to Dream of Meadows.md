A time to dream of meadows,
Where the lilacs bloom in grace,
Where birds’ songs are a fabric,
Woven in a warm embrace.
The sky, a blue pavilion,
Where all secrets are made free,
In the dance of nature’s rhythm,
Whispers of eternity.
And the river flows in quiet,
With its soft and gentle sighs,
Holding onto ancient stories
Beneath the vast expanding skies.

- Marina Tsvetaeva
