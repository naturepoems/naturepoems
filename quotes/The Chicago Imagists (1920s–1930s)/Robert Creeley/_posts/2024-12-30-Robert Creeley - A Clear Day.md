A Clear Day

Clouds lift, clearing
  under the sun,
light warms the air.
I sit on the porch
  holding bees and birds,
waiting, always waiting
for something more to come,
a dance edging by
  the flowers. 
Stillness of mind.

All around,
a soft whispering,
everything blends,
yet holds in silence,
a moment speaking,
on the sound of a life
  we share.


- Robert Creeley
