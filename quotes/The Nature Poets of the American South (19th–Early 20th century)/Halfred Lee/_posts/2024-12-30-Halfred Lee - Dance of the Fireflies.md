Dance of the Fireflies

As twilight falls, the magic starts,  
With tiny lights, they play their parts.  
Fireflies twinkle with dreams untold,  
A ballet in the night, bright and bold.
  
Across the fields, they gently glide,  
A shimmering wave, with nature's pride.  
In the stillness, their dance will weave,  
A moment of wonder, one to believe.


- Halfred Lee
