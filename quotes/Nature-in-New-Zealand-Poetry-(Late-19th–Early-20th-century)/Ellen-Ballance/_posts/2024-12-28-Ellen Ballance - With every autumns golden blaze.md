With every autumn's golden blaze,  
The trees, adorned in colors bold,  
Stand sentinel 'gainst winter's freeze,  
A story of life, both new and old.  
The leaves drift down like whispered dreams,  
Softly laying on the ground,  
A tapestry of warmth and chill,  
Where nature’s rhythms spin around.

- Ellen Ballance
