A Ballad of Trees and the Master

By Sidney Lanier

I
Into the woods my Master went,
       Clean forspent, for spent;
And he met the little children there,
       They knew his face so fair.

II
‘Your Lord is in the woods,’ they said,
       ‘He is gone to dream, to pray,
And you shall find his face lumed red,
       As he walks in the way.'

- Sidney Lanier
