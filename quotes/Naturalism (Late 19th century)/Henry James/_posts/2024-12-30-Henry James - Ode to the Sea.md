Oceans stretch far to meet the sky,
Where the sun dips low and colors fly.
The rhythmic waves a soft embrace,
An endless dance in nature’s grace.

With whispered winds and distant calls,
The heart is set amidst the thralls,
Of nature’s beauty, wild and free,
A timeless tune, a symphony.


- Henry James
