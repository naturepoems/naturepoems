To the wild we pledge our hearts,  
Where the world is dressed in green,  
And every step is art,  
Etched on a canvas unseen,  
Where wonder is the thread in all.

Here the heartbeat of the land,  
In rhythm with our own,  
In nature’s hand, we stand,  
And from her grace, we have grown,  
In the embrace of days untold.


- George Ripley
