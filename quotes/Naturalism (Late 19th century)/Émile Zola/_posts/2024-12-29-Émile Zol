In every raindrop, a new world spins,
As the earth drinks deep, its thirst begins;
The green awakens, a vibrant show,
In the heart of spring, life starts to flow.

With flowers bursting in radiant bloom,
Each petal dispels winter’s gloom;
The colors dance in the morning light,
As Nature wakes from its long, cold night.

In the symphony of growth and grace,
We find ourselves in this sacred space;
With every heartbeat, the rhythms weave,
In Nature’s arms, we learn to believe.


- Émile Zola
