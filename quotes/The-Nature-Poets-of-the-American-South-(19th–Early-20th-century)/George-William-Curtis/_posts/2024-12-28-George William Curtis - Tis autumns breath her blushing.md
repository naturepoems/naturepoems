'Tis autumn's breath, her blushing crest,
As she lays her garments down;
The mellow hue of each wandering quest,
Is a statement from nature's crown.

Shall we not join in the evening ball,
Where the leaves intertwine and flaunt?
Bringing a message from beyond the wall,
Of the harvest that we all want.
