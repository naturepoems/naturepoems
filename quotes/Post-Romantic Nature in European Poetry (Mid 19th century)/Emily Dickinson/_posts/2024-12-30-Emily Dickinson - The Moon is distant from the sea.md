The Moon is distant from the sea  
And yet can touch the sea  
As the touch that stirs the slumbering waves  
Is the essence that stirs me —  

For every gentle breath I feel  
In nature’s fair embrace  
Is the pulse of all that life unfolds,  
And blesses every space —  

So now when stillness takes my heart  
And whispers soft and small  
I feel the moon upon my lips  
And hear the silence call —

- Emily Dickinson
