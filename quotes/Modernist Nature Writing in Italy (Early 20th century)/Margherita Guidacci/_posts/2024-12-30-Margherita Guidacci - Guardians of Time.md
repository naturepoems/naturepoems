Mountains rise with ancient grace,
tall guardians softly draped
in shifting clouds and dreams,
time is suspended in their shadows.

Each echo lingers,
carried by the windâ€™s embrace,
whispering tales of days gone by,
of silent watchers standing vigilant
against the passage of fleeting moments.

- Margherita Guidacci
