Oh, hush thee, my darling, lie still with me;  
For I am the Spirit of the wilderness free—  
I shall lead you through valleys of emerald blight,  
To the sweet dells of fanciful insight.  
 
And the thickets grow thick, and the petals rejoice,  
In harmony quietly whispering choice;  
From a song of the river—a serenade bliss—  
O come forth, I’ll grant you my kiss!

- George Gordon Lord Byron
