In the Woods  

In the woods, the growing night  
Is thick and heavy like a shroud;  
The sun has slipped past tired oaks,  
And gravity all but bows  
As winter leans towards the root,  
Where every breath is crisp with dew.  
Wells of silence set the stars a-dream,  
The shadows puzzle deep now lost.  

Stay quiet; whisper the words of life’s thaw  
Among the breaths of sweetened air,  
Every rustle unfurling memories with glee —  
So morning follows, like a flame  
Revoking what began  
As penchant for leaving and time unknowing.  

The woods are deep, yet full,  
With the sweet scents of foreign souls  
Scattered through the leaves;  
Thus all shall dance on the wrist of night  
As the new day pours its grace.

- Louis MacNeice
