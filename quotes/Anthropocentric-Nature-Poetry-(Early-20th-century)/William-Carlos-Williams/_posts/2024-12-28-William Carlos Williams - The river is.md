The river is 
  a gone river now,
  gone with the sun,  but still 
  within the heart, it comes again, 
  back across the rock banks 
  which gently pull away.

  All has been changed with the tides, 
  and though it skips, it flows, 
  while we remain waiting, indefinitely.

- William Carlos Williams
