A Moonlit Night
I saw you painted in the moonlit night
As many roses planted in the light.
The way you stand beside the shadowy trees
In prairies dressed for dance with the summer breeze.

And with every sound, the night is still here,
Perpetual music wishing to hear.
For the light from the moon flows gracefully down
Upon your dress of white from the old brown town.

With wildest air, the breeze of night will rise
And dance away the quiet shades of skies.
To see you in your graceful dance of light
Will keep my heart awake through the moonlit night.

- Robert Frost
