The Coming of John
John's a boy, and he is not strong,
John is down at the creek
With the silver stones,
And the ringing of the water.

John's a child, and he has lost,
John lights a fire, and watches the smoke rise,
He sees the birds gather in trees,
With hands reaching for the sky.

But the sky is lonely,
And his heart is full.
John, a boy, finds joy in the sounds
And he waits—hoping tomorrow will bring
A life of hope in his arms.



- Langston Hughes
