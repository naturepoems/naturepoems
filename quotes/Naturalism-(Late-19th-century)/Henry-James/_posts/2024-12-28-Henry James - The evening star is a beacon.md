The evening star is a beacon bright,
A pinprick in the blanket of night;
It calls to the weary, the lost at sea,
In the quiet expanse, it beckons me.

The moon hangs low, a silver thread,
Weaving dreams from the thoughts we shed;
In the stillness, I find my place,
In nature's embrace, a warm, sweet grace.


- Henry James
