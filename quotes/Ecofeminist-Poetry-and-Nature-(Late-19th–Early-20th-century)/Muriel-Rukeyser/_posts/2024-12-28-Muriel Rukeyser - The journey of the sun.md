The journey of the sun   
crosses the sky;   
we, with all our   
initials,   
run in pulses of heat.  

There is a little light   
given to me;   
it fills my fingers,   
this moment of sun   
of the artichoke.  

The soil sings a little,   
shouting at the sky   
in pale blue waves —   
I eat this morning.
