I found my son  
a stranger  
in the woods  
and  
against  
a tree  
he was  
arrested—  
in his  
untouched  
jacket  
clothed in  
green moss  
he was  
humming  
a tune  
to  
himself  
like a  
grown man  
who  
had lost  
his way  

he said  
it’s  
a long way  

but he came  
back  
picking  
the leaves  
in  
a little heap  
of  
gold

and I  
felt  
like a tree  
that had grown  
like the rest  
that bends  
to  
the wind.

- William Carlos Williams
