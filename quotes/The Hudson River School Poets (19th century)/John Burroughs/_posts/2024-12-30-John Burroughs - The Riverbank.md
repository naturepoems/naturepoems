The Riverbank

By the gentle riverbank I sit,
Where the waters shimmer and glide,
Each ripple a story it can’t omit,
As it carries the dreams of the world alongside.

The willows weep with a grace so pure,
Their branches brush against the supple ground,
In the soft embrace of nature, I find a cure,
For in every sound there’s a healing sound.

Here in this place, my heart finds ease,
Among the whispers of the flowing stream,
For the river speaks in its native keys,
And leads me gently into a dream.

- John Burroughs
