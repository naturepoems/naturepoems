There is a forest holy place,
A vale of high seclusion,
Where the wild flowers bloom in grace
In glorious profusion.

The breezes whisper tales of yore,
Birds in sweet chorus sing,
And nature holds her mystic lore,
In the joy that she doth bring.

Upon those glades the sunbeams play,
In every shade and hallow,
While cloud and thunder dance away,
Where timid feet may follow.

Oft from the brook the ripple comes,
Soft as a lover’s kiss,
Where the heart, beneath the sylvan drums,
Bears witness to pure bliss.

- William Wordsworth
