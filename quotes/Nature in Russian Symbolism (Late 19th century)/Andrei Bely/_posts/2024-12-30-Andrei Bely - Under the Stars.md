Beneath the stars, I find my way, 
Where shadows dance and spirits play.
In natureâ€™s arms, the night holds sway, 
As dreams awaken, night turns to day.

The crickets sing their lullaby, 
While fireflies flicker in the sky.
In this embrace where memories lie, 
My heart finds peace, it yearns to fly.

Amongst the trees, where silence reigns,
The beauty of nature soothes my pains.
In every heartbeat, life attains, 
A rhythm found, where love remains.

- Andrei Bely
