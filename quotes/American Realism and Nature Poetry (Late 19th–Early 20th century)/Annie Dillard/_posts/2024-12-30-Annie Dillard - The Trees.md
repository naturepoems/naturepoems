Do you know what it’s like
    to give your heart to trees?
Their arms in the wind
    whistling your very name.
And the leaves, like spirits,
    float down—remnants of joy,
gentle raindrops touching the earth.
The trees remember.
    They breathe memories of the sun,
whispering secrets to the sky.
Open your ears, your eyes,
    let them speak of life,
    the messages they hold,
so strong, so silent.

               – From "The Trees"

- Annie Dillard
