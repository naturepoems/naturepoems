In the springtime dawn,
When new life breaks through,
The buds on branches
Bring the color anew,
Each blossom a story,
That lives on the breeze,
In the soul of the forest,
Set free from the trees.

Hopes bloom in silence,
Whispers call to their kin,
A dance with the breezes,
In rhythm akin,
For who can resist
This vibrant surprise,
As the universe smiles,
And our hearts rise.

- Henry David Thoreau
