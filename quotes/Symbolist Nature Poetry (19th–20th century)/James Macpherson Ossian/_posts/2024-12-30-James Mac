Riverside Reverie
By the tranquil river, my thoughts take flight,
In the beauty of silence, in the waning light.
With the rippling waters that flow so free,
I lose myself in nature’s decree.

The banks adorned with flowers bright,
Reflecting the hues of the fading light,
In the gentle sway, life seems to pause,
In the whispering flow, I find my cause.


- James Macpherson Ossian
