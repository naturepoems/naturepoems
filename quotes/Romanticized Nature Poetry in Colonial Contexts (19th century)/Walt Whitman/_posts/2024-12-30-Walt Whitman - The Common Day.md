This is what you shall do: Love the earth and sun, 
And the animals; despise riches; 
Give alms to every one that asks; 
Stand up for the stupid and crazy; 
Devote your income and labor to others; 
Hate tyrants; 
Argue not concerning God;
Have patience and indulgence toward the people; 
Take off your hat to nothing known or unknown,
Or to any man or number of men; 
Go freely with powerful uneducated persons,
And with the young, and with the mothers of the young;
Gather the family around you, 
And dine and play your songs, 
Dance with your neighbors, and sing with your neighborâ€™s kids.

- Walt Whitman
