A winding path through the emerald glade,
Beneath the boughs where the sunlight played.
Each step upon the mossy trail,
A soothing balm where worries pale.

Wildflowers bloom with colors bright,
Nature's brush creates pure delight.
As we stroll through this enchanted land,
Our hearts and spirits forever expand.

- Clive Bell
