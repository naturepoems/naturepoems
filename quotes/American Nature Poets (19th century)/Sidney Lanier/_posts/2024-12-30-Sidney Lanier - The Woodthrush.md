The Woodthrush

From the shadowy woods, the woodthrush sings,
A story told in glimmers and lures,
With notes like agate bright on silver wings,
A song of souls in love that endures.

His heart beats strong, a myriad sigh,
Rising in the evening's sweet embrace,
As Nature’s siren draws me nigh,
To linger in her green, enchanting space.
—Sidney Lanier
