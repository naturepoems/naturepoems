The Pied Piper of Hamelin  
At morning dew,  
The green twists bloom anew,  
With every color expressed,  
And the air of light feels blessed.

Dance to the rhythm of the pipe's clear call!  
Nature's tune belongs to us all,  
And the sweetest fruits can’t help but fall  
When the secret path in bloom does enthrall!

- Robert Browning
