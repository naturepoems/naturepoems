The earth is filled with love,  
If love’s heart holds a dream;  
It can cast its light in shades of favor,  
A thousand thoughts entwined in a stream,  
A dance begun as the new dawn breaks,  
With reflected glories to the skies  
In laughter's reign, where nature plagues.

A consequence of sorrow spent,  
Dream not!  
For joy's music calls around,  
In every blade of grass below,  
And every petal's grace abound,  
These are love's roles, as pure delight,  
Awakened in the still and tearful night.

- Lord Byron
