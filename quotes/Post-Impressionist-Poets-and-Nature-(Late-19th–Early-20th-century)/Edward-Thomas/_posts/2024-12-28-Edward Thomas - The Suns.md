The Sun’s Eye
Once every shadow doth seem to fade,
And all the leaves in sunlight spade,
To capture life in its gentle glow,
A dance of nature, its wondrous show.

Round every tree, the light’s embrace,
Imparting soul, immortal grace.
Whether storm or sun, they hold their peace,
In silent beauty, life’s sweet release.

- Edward Thomas
