Autumn's Whisper

As summer fades and leaves grow gold,
The world transforms, a painted scene,
In rustling whispers, stories told,
The beauty lies in what has been.

The harvest moon, so large and bright,
Illuminates the tranquil night,
In every breath, the chill sets in,
A testament to change’s kin.

Yet still, with each descending leaf,
A promise deep, no need for grief,
For nature's cycle spins anew,
In autumn's breath, life’s grace shines through.

- Clara Wadel
