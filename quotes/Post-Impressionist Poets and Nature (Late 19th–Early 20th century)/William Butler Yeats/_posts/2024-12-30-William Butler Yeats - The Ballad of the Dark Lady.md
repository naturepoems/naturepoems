The Ballad of the Dark Lady

Under the shadowed palm trees,
In a garden, where scents combine,
I search for the Dark Lady’s kiss,
Where colors clash and nature entwines.

A dance with bygone lovers fair,
And a singer in the golden light,
A past I wish to hold so dear,
With a flicker of heaven’s delight.

- William Butler Yeats
