The autumn leaves, a fiery quilt,  
Spread across the land, a feast,  
With every hue, rich dreams to built,  
As nature dons her rich increase.  

The crisp air carries tales of change,  
Of seasons turning, lifeâ€™s sweet spin,  
In every moment, wide and strange,  
The art of life, its losses, wins.

- William Ellery Channing
