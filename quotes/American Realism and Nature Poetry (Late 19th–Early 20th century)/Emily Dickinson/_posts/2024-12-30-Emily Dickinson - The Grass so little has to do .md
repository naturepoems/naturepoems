The Grass so little has to do –  
A Sphere of Shorter Blue –  
A Flower that lives the shortest Day  
Is above and beyond as you –  

The Trees, but trodden by the Wind –  
And of a madder Green –  
Came back to weep and cry again  
And hold a Stolen Bough –  

The Grass you see in all the Light  
Of rain all over your face –  
The more it gives the more it lives –  
The more diversity of grace –  


- Emily Dickinson
