The Idea of Order at Key West

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind
Of man; that was in the mind
Of a woman singing.  And the song,
Though she sang it in the land, was
A song of the sea, perhaps, or,
If we cannot know or imagine,
A thought in love with the sea
And therefore a thought of ourselves,
Another woman, singing.

And here were all the oceans,
And here the orchard blooms along the shore,
Brick cool and red.
In shadows garden-bridges,
There were shadows of these berries,
The daylight glared upon with gilded rays
And sombre sea
And upon terrace
And pearl wanderings.

Echo, echo;
The sea is a voice with rhythm,
With wash and spray and song
That she sang with her mind.
Her mind a mind of water

Trembling with song and shadow,
With detail of wave, upon wave,
A worldly tuneâ€”indeed an order,
As she sang on as a sea-goer 
Out of the blue and into the gold.
