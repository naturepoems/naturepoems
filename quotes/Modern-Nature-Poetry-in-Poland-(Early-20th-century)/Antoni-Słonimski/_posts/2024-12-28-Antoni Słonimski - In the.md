In the Meadow

In golden fields where daisies bloom,
The sun spills joy on earth's bright face,
Life flourishes amidst green's loom,
In nature's grace, we find our place.

Crickets chirp their evening song,
As twilight blankets over day,
Where shadows stretch and dreams belong,
The simple heart is free to play.

Stars awaken in the endless night,
A symphony of light above,
In the meadow, all feels right,
Wrapped in nature’s gentle love.
