The Day Lady Died
It’s a beautiful day,
    not a cloud in the sky
    and I’m walking in the park
with my friend,
    when she said,
    “Did you hear about the lady?”
“Lady who?”
    “No, the lady,
    the one who sang.”
I knew right away,
    the way she said it,
    it’s not just the lady
that died—it’s how
    the sun
    fell down
    and rested
    on the streets of New York.
I went into a bar and ordered a drink,
    just to calm myself,
    when I noticed the trees
    turning
    bright,
like the lady I loved,
    who had gotten lost
in the divorce of lights.
Does anyone know where she is now?
    Yes, they are singing still.
