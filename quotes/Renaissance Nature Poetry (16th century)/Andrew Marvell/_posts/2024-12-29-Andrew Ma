A Dialogue Between the Soul and Body

Body:
     
O my soul! why doth thou cling so near,  
And wound my flesh with every fear?  
Behold the world, so rich, so vast—  
My being thrives; let shadows pass!  

Soul:
    
Dear body, cease your tragic pleas,  
For nature's light is but a tease;  
Yet in your bones, I find my place,  
Together we can weave our grace.  

Body:
    
Shall we not seek the wondrous glade,  
In streams and blooms our joy cascade?  
To nature’s arms, come dance with me,  
And feel the earth’s sweet harmony.  

Soul:
    
In every petal, every breeze,  
I see the world with such sheer ease;  
Let us unite, both body, soul—  
In nature’s arms, we are made whole.

- Andrew Marvell
