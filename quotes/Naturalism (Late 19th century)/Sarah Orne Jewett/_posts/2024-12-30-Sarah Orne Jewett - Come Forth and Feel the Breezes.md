Come forth and feel the breezes blow,
   And hear the songbirds play;
   In every petal’s hue aglow,
   The woodland’s grand array.
   The brook that sparkles in the sun,
   And dances to the sky,
   Shall whisper tales as we run
   In twilight’s soft reply.
   The world awakens here with me,
   In every fragrant bough,
   And as we wander wild and free,
   We join the beauty now.

- Sarah Orne Jewett
