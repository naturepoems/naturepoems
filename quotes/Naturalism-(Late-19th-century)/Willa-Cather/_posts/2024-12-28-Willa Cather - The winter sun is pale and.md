The winter sun is pale and cold,
The water lies still, encased in ice,
Yet through the trees, a flicker of gold,
A promise of spring, a subtle spice.

The pines stand tall, a silent guard,
Witness to the seasons’ endless flow,
In their green embrace, I’ve wandered far,
Amongst the silent whispers of snow.

Soon the earth will wake from her slumber,
With hues of green dancing in the breeze,
And I shall tread softly in her number,
Among the flowers beneath the trees.

But for now, I find solace in this scene,
In the quiet beauty of a frozen land,
Where nature's peace reigns majestic and serene,
Crafting a world that is simple and grand.

- Willa Cather
