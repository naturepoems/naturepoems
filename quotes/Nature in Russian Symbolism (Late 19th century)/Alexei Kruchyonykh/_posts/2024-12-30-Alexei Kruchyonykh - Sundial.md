Sundial
The sun dips low against the gnarled bark,
And shadows stretch, long fingers in the park.
A silent gauge, the sundial speaks in light,
Measuring moments of joy and delight.

The flowers whisper secrets to the breeze,
And rustling leaves dance like lovers at ease.
In this quiet hour, time seems to stall,
Nature's soft heartbeat echoes through it all.
