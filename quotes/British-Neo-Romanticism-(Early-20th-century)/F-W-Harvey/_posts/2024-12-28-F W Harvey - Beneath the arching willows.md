Beneath the arching willow's grace,
Where shadows fall and secrets bloom,
I tread in silence, find my place,
In nature's heart, midst green perfume.

The winding paths, in stillness reflect,
A mirror of all lifeâ€™s embrace,
Where every step, and soft object,
In harmony, we find our space.


- F W Harvey
