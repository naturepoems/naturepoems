The Stolen Child

Where dips the rocky highland
Of sleuthing glen, I look away
And leave in her splashy eyes
The laughter and smiles of night.

I will leave my soul to run
In the glen, where the bright swans lie,
Catching myself, my gentle heart,
While lilies dance and rivers sigh.

The child I stole from sleep,
I'll leave to dream, that all may see
How deep into that forest’n
The magic of the wild can be.

- William Butler Yeats
