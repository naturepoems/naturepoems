The Grass so little has to do,  
A Sphere of simple Green,  
Yet offer here and there, a Leaf,  
Or Two was all, that ’s seen –  

And then a Shrub, for company,  
A Bush of Leaves to sigh,  
And sky must hold the other  
That might be all the Cry  

Of Nature to the Little Grass,  
That offers her, no more,  
But ought to lift her Lustre high  
Than in the Dawn or Night's decor  

For only Nature's Golden Fork  
Keeps swelling it beyond  
The realms of what is born to truly  
Seem no more than sound –  

Yet sundry visions bloom around,  
Why can’t they find the Night?  
What matters to a world of Grace  
If Light has been all right?  

And, when they breathe away  
No line and shimmer into Light,  
Till all the world is met again  
In Nature’s sable height!

- Emily Dickinson
