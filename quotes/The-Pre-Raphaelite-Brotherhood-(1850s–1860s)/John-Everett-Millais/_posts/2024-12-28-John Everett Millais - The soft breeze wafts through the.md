The soft breeze wafts through the trees,  
And whispers so sweetly low,  
Stirs the petals of blooms as they please,  
Where the daisies in sunlight glow.

The brook, a silvery thread,  
Winds on through the vale below,  
Where the shadowed heavens shed  
Sparkling droplets fresh from the snow.

- John Everett Millais
