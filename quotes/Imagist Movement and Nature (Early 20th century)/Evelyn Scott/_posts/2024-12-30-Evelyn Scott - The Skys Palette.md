The sky transforms with each passing hour,
In the play of colors, dark and bright,
From dawn's gentle fingers, to dusk's embrace,
Nature shifts and swirls in artistry divine.
The moments ebbing and flowing like tides,
Each breath captured in the dance of time,
In whispers of beauty, ever fleetingâ€”
A glimpse eternal in the heart of Nature.

- Evelyn Scott
