The Great River

The river is a great blue vein
Running through this land.
It glistens in the sunlight,
A mirror to the sky,
A restless motion that holds
The dreams of all who pass.

The cypress trees nod their heads,
Their roots dipping in the water,
A world afloat on liquid glass,
Where silver fish leap
And dragonflies dance in circles.

Beyond the banks, the wildflowers bloom,
And the soft winds carry the scent of pine.
Here is the peace of a southern morning,
The hush of the wild, the song of the unseen
Whispers of the ancient earth beneath my feet.

Here, the journey begins,
As the great river flows onward,
An endless story written by the hands of time.

- John Thompson
