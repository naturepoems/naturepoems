The winter's chill wraps all in white,
A landscape draped in frozen peace,
Where nature's breath, both sharp and bright,
Invites us to the quiet lease.

Footprints left in snow so pure,
Crystalline under the frosty light,
In nature’s stillness, we endure,
Though cold, our hearts are warm and bright.
