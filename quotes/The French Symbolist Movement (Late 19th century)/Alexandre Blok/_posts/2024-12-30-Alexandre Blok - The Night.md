The Night

I shall not see my homeland anymore,
Nor hear the distant rumble of its waters;
From far away – dark forces awaken,
Desire takes root in all things obscured...

And in the swamps, fog flows silently,
Golden sun rests too, a flight of spirits,
Down on the lake's rippling, tender shapes,
Murmur, dulcet sounds of seduction.

What lingers here is the night; night
And silence hums above the shadowy entreaties,
And floating dreams of my homeland...
The twilight is bearing its fruit – the night!

- Alexandre Blok
