Woodnotes

   I
   A sweet and secret tune
   Goes echoing in the pall,
   Among the trees, a thrumming,
   Wild whispers through it all.

   Cupped in their hands, like cradles,
   They are the walls of our lovely air;
   The woods breathe and guard my fables,
   Heal my soul and keep me fair.

   II
   Let me hide among the clover,
   Cloaked in moss and root so sweet,
   Where the Sun will stroboscope my cover,
   And the stars will lend their beat.

                                                       —Ralph Waldo Emerson
