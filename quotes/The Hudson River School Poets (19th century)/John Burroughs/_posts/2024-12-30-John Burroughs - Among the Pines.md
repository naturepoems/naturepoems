Among the Pines

Among the pines, where shadows play,
And the air is filled with the scent of resin,
I find a place to rest and stay,
Where nature’s calm feels like a presence.

The trees stand tall, like sentinels brave,
Guarding the secrets of the forest deep,
Each rustle of leaves, a whisper, a wave,
In the arms of the woods, my soul can leap.

With every breath, I’m filled with peace,
As I listen to the stories told,
Among the pines, my troubles cease,
In their lofty embrace, I am consoled.

- John Burroughs
