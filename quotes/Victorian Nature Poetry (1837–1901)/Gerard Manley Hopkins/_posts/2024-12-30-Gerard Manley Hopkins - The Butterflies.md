Each morning big drops  
Bring calm—like fire  
In foliage—the lace of life  
Of green maxims wend  
To find they shall lend.  

As many hours pass—
Thus to the crickets riding,  
As gentle dew keeps days  
Alive ‘neath climbing brinks;  
While slow is the eye, no strain  
Yet of ground firm and of each minute leaf in glee.  

To be light—like spirits in a cast,  
Where light means forrest and quiet breezes talk an opening cry—  
Warmed within, the cypress tree  
Leans back with swift embrace, again—to green!

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
