The Glacial Lake

In stillness waits the glacial lake,
Reflections dance, soft ripples break,
A mirror of the mountains’ might,
Where water holds both day and night.

The icy grip, a touch divine,
Among the trees, the sun will shine,
With every breeze, the silence sighs,
In nature’s breath, my spirit flies.

Oh glacial lake, so crystal clear,
You hold my dreams and every fear,
In your embrace, I’m free to roam,
A tranquil heart, forever home.

- John Muir
