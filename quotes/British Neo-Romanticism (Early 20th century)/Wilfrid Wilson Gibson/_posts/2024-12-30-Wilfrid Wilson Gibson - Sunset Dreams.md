Sunset Dreams

As the sun dips low and the shadows creep,
I breathe in hues where the daylight weeps;
With colors spilling in a wondrous dance,
And twilight calling as evening’s chance.

The sky ignites in a blazing glow,
While memories linger of the day’s soft flow;
And gazing high, as the stars appear,
I drink the beauty that holds me near.

Oh, sunset dreams, with your magic light,
You weave a spell in the blooming night;
In every moment, my spirit soars,
As nature whispers on distant shores.
