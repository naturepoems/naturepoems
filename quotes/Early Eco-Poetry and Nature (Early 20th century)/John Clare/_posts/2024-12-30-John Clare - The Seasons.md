The Seasons
Upon the swirl of seasonsâ€™ breath  
Of every ebb, and every flow,  
Where days shall weave the threads of death  
That autumn glows, already slow.
 
But spring shall lift the heavy mold  
And blast the chill with warming light,  
Let life erupt in colors bold  
In joy, as day returns to night.

- John Clare
