Love's Philosophy

The fountains mingle with the river
And the rivers with the ocean;
The winds of heaven mix forever
With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single;
All things by a law divine
In one another's being mingle—
Why not I with thine?

See, the mountains kiss high heaven
And the waves clasp one another;
No sister flower would be forgiven
If it disdain'd its brother;
And the sunlight clasps the moonlight
In a kind of married love;
And the sea-girls clasp one another
In the shadow of their dove.

What are all these kissings worth
If thou kiss not me?

- Percy Bysshe Shelley
