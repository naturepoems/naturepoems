The Sky

The ever-changing, endless blue,  
Where clouds drift soft, and dreams come true;  
Above the world, they float and swell,  
A beauty words can never tell.

The sun's warm rays, a gentle kiss,  
Declare in light the world's sweet bliss;  
In every hue, the wonder stirs,  
A canvas held by nature’s murmurs.

- Hartley Coleridge
