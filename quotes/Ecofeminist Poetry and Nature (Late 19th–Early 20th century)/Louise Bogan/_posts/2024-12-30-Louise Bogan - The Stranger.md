The Stranger  
I walk in the quiet,  
   undulating marshes  
    where reeds inhale  
   the solitude of fading spring.  
Once,  
   I heard a voice  
   carol through the reed  
        and the water,  
called me back  
   to a fluttering world  
      where sky-lights shimmer  
   over draping green,  
and I am alone  
   with whispers in the night.

- Louise Bogan
