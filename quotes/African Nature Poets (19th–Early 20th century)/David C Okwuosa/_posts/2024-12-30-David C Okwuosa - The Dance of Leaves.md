The Dance of Leaves

In the autumn breeze, leaves tumble down,
A dance of colors, a russet crown,
They swirl and twirl in nature’s waltz,
Each one whispering its own true pulse.

From vibrant green to a fiery red,
The cycle of life, none shall dread,
In the rustling whispers, stories unfold,
The magic of nature, forever bold.

- David C Okwuosa
