A narrow bud opens, a shaped blossom,  
I see the world full of cadence and color,  
With the drops of rain gathering;  
I shed what’s needed to wash it clean.  
All is interspersed and entwined,  
In the flowers of the fields,  
In the winding roads,  
In all that blooms under your gaze.

- Walt Whitman
