To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
Have from the forest shook three summers' pride,
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,
In process of the seasons have I seen,
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
   Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial hand,
   Steal from his figure, ere the time be done.
   That you remember the well of heaven's strand,
   And you alone have guilt wherein the sun
   Doth take a diamond's glass at noon, I know:
   Therefore to tell the beauteous that you fare
   Makes me grow old, though never you can stare.

â€” Sonnet 104

- William Shakespeare
