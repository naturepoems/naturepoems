In the end, peace shall prevail,  
A great calmness of many days,  
Daylight and time will quote,
How wind shall blow, into dark boundaries,  
Nevermore to wander alone over this earth.  

Long shall I pluck the leaves of bridging woods,  
How autumn ripens from thin shadows.  
When autumn stands dark from the far edge  
To see the small group at end of all twilight.

- Robert Frost
