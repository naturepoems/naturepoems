Autumn Colors

Leaves slip like thoughts,
  colors unspooled before the wind,
gold, red, and brown fall down
like memories into the air,
  into the season.
Colors like music shift,
  vibrant ebbing moments;
fingers trace the patterns,
  light drifts across the vision.

The world holds fast here,
  and the trees stretch,
a long way encircling light,
testing daylight with night,
  each clump cradles itself,
  waiting for the dance that follows.
Let it all cascade,
  let it all renew,
each turn a question,
  each rustle a delight.

Let the autumn find you.
  Let the waiting unfold.
Time measures life,
  as beauty blooms and glows.

- A R Ammons
