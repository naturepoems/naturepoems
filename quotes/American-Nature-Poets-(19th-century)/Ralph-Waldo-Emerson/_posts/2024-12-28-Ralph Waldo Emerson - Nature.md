Nature

Nature is a plantation;  
The planets, animals, minerals,  
Must see in you their seed,  
The divinities must own acceptance.  
For each element then sought recess,  
To learn how to be free of sin,  
And thus through meditation=
Gathers what man is in communion.  
The stars meet the wish,  
The desire folds itself like leaves.
