A Summer Day
I remember this love,
the arch of sunlight over the bright lawn.
I can already feel the city walls closing,
as I leisurely walk among the flowers.
Days shall be endless in my dreaming,
as the bees hum harmonies to the sunflowers.
I breathe in the warm breeze and catch the scent
of raspberry and honey, the weight of the air,
one golden day of summer guiding me home.

- Mary Oliver
