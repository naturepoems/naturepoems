The wildest animals
Will not become for my comfort,
Or even their own,
Mild and domesticated—
And I owe them a debt of gratitude
For keeping me humble;  
In their presence,
I am always a stranger—
Such are the advantages of our wildness.

If I stay out here long enough,
My words will be banks of snow,
And I shall enjoy the silence.
  
At last I will sit down
In some sun-dappled glade,
Where singing loves may tune my waking dreams,
And nature's voice become my muse.

- Henry David Thoreau
