O world, I cannot hold thee close enough!
Thy winds, thy wide gray skies!
Fleeting as morning dew, as close as a lover's sigh,
Your air is a magic that nourishes my dreams.
I want to linger here forever, close beneath your touch
Where wildflowers laugh, and twilight softly gleams.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
