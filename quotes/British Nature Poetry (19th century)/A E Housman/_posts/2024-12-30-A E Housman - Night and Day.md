When I beheld the silent grave
And saw it there slid in the gray,
I thought of all unlighted dreams,  
And still, the sun seems far away.

For now the night grows deeper still:
The tree, the hay, will change and fade,
Until thereâ€™s hope for every Hill,
And hearts abide, but never laid.

- A E Housman
