The river rolls onward, a timeless refrain,
While the sun shines a mirror, on her silken domain;
In a cradle of blue, the hills fold their arms,
A safe place for whispers and nature’s sweet charms.

The echo of footsteps on the soft mossy floor,
Speak of nature’s communion and how we explore;
For the symphony swells in the hush of the trees,
And the heart finds a rhythm that dances with ease.


- C J Dennis
