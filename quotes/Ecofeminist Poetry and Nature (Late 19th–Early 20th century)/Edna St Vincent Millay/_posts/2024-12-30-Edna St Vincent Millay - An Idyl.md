AN IDYL

I shall not be a master,
For only as a servant I agree;
I’d rather lose the day than steal a breath,
And grace the sea with my own mortality.

Above the sheltering trees,
The coolness of the brook,
There’s sweetness in the air,
As if the green wood spoke,
And Nature had awake for me,
A sense of all that’s true.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
