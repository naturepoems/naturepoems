The garden is the place where the heart goes,
a quiet spot for wonder and repose,
where soil's rich gift continues on,
attracting bees and deft-eyed dawn.

Immortal beauty in leaf and bloom,
insects tumbling round the room
of summer's breath, a sanctuary made
of peace and thought, each blade displayed.

Natureâ€™s self speaks for us, a song
of continuity, where we belong.
