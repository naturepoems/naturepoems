The Almond Tree
Awakened by shadows,  
The almond tree is a keeper  
Of frost-white dreams,  
Of soft green curls,  
In circular glades,  
Here the unshed tears of birdsâ€”  
Morning interspersed in light,  
The cherry blossoms drip,  
And time weaves through stillness,  
Life unfolds.

- Marianne Moore
