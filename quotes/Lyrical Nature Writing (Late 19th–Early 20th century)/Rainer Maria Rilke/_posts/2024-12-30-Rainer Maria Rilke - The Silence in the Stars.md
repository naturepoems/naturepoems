The Silence in the Stars

How your silence fills the stars,
    that glimmers soft above the mountain,
    where time slips into the embrace
    of every sighing night between.

    Oh love, if you can see
    the harmony in the emptiness,
    then do not fear the whispers
    that will guide you home.

—Rainer Maria Rilke
