Epiphany

When the light flows in a surprise of song,
And earth wraps all its days fulfilled,
The calm of the morning hush where we belong
Opens to vistas of life distilled.

R600, R509, senses alive,
While streams clap cheerfully upon their way,
In gentle reminder, the heart might strive,
To re-echo the lonely pain of sway.

Look where the stillness wanders with knowing gaze,
Drawing all close in a flickering life,
As marrow within to savor the grace,
Of this fleeting moment in nature’s strife.

- John Crowe Ransom
