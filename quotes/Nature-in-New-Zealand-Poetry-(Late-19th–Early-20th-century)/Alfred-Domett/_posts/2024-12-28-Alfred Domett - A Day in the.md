A Day in the Bush

A day in the bush, a day in the sun,
    With the wild, wild winds a-blowing;
With the calls of the birds and the joy it has spun,
    Through the trees and the flowers a-glowing.

Oh, sweet is the sound of the river’s soft play,
    Where silver moonbeams are dancing;
And the shadows grow long in the warm dying day,
    Where the flowers are brightly prancing.
