Dusk

When evening plunges deep the land,
And all is hushed beneath the dark,
I wander where the shadows stand,
And trace the reverie of a lark.

The gentle whisper of the breeze,
In soft embrace of evening light,
Weaves through the solemn, swaying trees,
As if to share its sweet insight.

In dusk’s embrace, the world recedes,
Colors bleed into the night,
Crickets play their fervent creeds,
Stars awaken in their flight.

Let silence reign, let shadows dance,
In this nocturnal symphony,
For in this quiet circumstance,
The heart finds peace, eternally.


- Valery Briussov
