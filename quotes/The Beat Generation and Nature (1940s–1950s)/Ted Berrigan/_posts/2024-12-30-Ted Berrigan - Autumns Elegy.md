In the midst of autumn,
trees stand ablaze,
a riot of colors
telling stories
of change.

Leaves drop like
whispers,
golden tongues kissing
the ground,
while the air is
filled with the scent
of nostalgia.

Each breath taken is
a gift,
a moment of
elegance,
a dance with the wind,
a symphony of
letting go.

- Ted Berrigan
