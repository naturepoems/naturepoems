September

O, when to the heart of man,
  Was it ever as it is now?
All mottled, mixed with bright, the grass
  Is faded by the draught of the day.  
Now the leaves are falling round,  
  All golden to the ground.
It was not so but yesterday,
  The sun was like a hand;  
The tree seemed with its live fruit  
That no stem had ever withstood.

Now there are nothing and the blue,  
  An empty road, and peace;  
In silence now the winds go by.  
Restless, I take my way,  
Assured of naught but this I see:  
All shadows of the things to be.

— Edward Thomas
