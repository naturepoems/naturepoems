The Whispering Grass

In fields of green, where wildflowers sway,
The grass whispers secrets, come what may,
A tapestry woven by nature’s grace,
In the silence, we find our place.

Each blade a story, each wind a sigh,
In the embrace of earth, we can’t deny,
Nature’s wisdom, in softness speaks,
In the quiet moments, the heart seeks.

- David C Okwuosa
