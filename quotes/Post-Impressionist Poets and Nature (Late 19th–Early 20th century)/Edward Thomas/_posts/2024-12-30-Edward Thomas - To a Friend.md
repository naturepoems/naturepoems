To a Friend

In every breath of air you find,  
The scent of trees enfolded tight,  
You shall know these heights, dear friend,  
With lands where nature's hands pretend.  

Let not the gloom that casts your way,  
Filled with earth's darkened greys;  
Take heart in nights of deeper dreams,  
Where echo finds the light of seams.  

For every grain whispers the history told,  
That time is bound to pass, unfolds;  
The world spins near, weaving us through,  
To link our hearts, though wide and true.

- Edward Thomas
