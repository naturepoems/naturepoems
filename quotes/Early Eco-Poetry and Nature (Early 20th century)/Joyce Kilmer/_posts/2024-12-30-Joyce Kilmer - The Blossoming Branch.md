The Blossoming Branch   
O sweet and tender springtime,  
Your blossoms crystal clear.  
They brighten all the pathways,  
So fragrant, fresh, and dear.  
The branches sway above me,  
With color rich and fine;  
O take this heart of mine as yoursâ€”  
For beauty here is divine!  



- Joyce Kilmer
