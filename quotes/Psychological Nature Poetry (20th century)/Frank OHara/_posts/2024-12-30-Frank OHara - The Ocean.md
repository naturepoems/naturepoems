The Ocean
Waves wash against the shore,
    like laughter laid down lightly,
sanding the edges of shells,
    glinting in the sunlight,
horns blowing soft songs,
    the ocean is open now,
   airy and gleaming,
    waves kiss the shore,
with secrets in their foam,
    the horizon dips,
   and I take a step,
      forever falling into the deep,
where dreams gather,
    all those shimmering stars,
         above the earth,
                 where I too,
         am a child of the waves.

— Frank O’Hara
