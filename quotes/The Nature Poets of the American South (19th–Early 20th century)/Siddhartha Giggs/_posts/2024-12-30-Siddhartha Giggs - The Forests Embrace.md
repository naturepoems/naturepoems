In the heart of the forest, shadows play,
As sunlight filters through in a golden array.
Moss carpets the ground, a cushion of green,
In this tranquil embrace, I find my serene.

A deer steps lightly, cautious yet bold,
In the arms of the trees, its stories unfold.
Nature, a canvas where life’s colors blend,
In her vibrant palette, my soul finds its mend.
