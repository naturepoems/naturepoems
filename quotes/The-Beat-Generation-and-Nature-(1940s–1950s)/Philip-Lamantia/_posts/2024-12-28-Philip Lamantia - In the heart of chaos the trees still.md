In the heart of chaos, the trees still stand,
Firm as time, with childlike hands;
They cradle the whispers of mist and rain,
In their silence, we find joy and pain.

The bloom of a wild rose, wild as the wind,
Resonates deep where the earth has been;
In each petal's fall lies a story untold,
Nature’s voice in mysteries bold.


- Philip Lamantia
