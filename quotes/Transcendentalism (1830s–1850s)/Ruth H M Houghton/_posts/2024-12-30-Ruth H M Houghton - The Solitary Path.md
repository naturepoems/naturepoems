The Solitary Path
Upon a winding, rustic trail,
Where whispers of the wild prevail,
I walk in solitude and peace,
As all my worldly worries cease.

The trees stand tall, a sentry strong,
While nature hums her ancient song,
In solitude, I find my way,
Embraced by Nature’s soft array.


- Ruth H M Houghton
