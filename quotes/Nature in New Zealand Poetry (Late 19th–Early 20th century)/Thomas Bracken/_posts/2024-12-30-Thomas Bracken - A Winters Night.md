A WINTER'S NIGHT

The stars alight on the blanket of snow,
Where silence weaves tales of secrets below;
The world sleeps in slumber, all calm and serene,
As winter's breath wraps the earth in its sheen.

The trees stand sentinel, cloaked in white,
Beneath the vast canvas of moon's gentle light;
Their branches adorned like a crystal display,
In the stillness of night, where shadows don’t sway.

In the flicker of fires that crackle and glow,
We gather together, where love’s warm winds blow;
For in winters’ embrace, we find the true art,
Of lingering moments, so dear to the heart.

Let us breathe in the depths of this peaceful scene,
And hold in our souls what the night has made keen;
For winters’ soft magic, forever will stay,
In the heart's sacred chamber, till spring finds her way.

- Thomas Bracken
