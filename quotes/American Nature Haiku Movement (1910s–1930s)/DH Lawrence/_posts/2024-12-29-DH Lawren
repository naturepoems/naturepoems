The Leaves

Leaves fall like whispers from the trees,
A soft ballet dancing on the warm wind.
Golden dreams in every rustle abound,
Each reaching down to caress the earth,
In a tapestry woven with stories forlorn,
The soft ground trembles beneath their weight,
And life catches breath as the colors fade,
The endless cycle of nature’s embrace.
   


- DH Lawrence
