In the Park
Butterflies dance across
    the air,
      dipping down lightly,
   their beauty woven
             amid lush greens,
it feels almost like a dream
      under the sun,
where the trees
        hold their green arms up,
      as if to embrace the day,
    laughing with children’s voices
on the breeze,
      their light footfalls,
spreading joy,
    among flowers,
    their colors revealing
       the glow around us here.

— Frank O’Hara
