Sierra peaks in hue-streaked crowns,  
Where the eagles soar and valleys sigh,  
A majesty that's timelessly renowned,  
Nature's embrace in the azure sky.

In whispered winds that carry tales,  
Of eons past and futures bright,  
In every rock, a saga hails,  
A testament set in nature’s light.


- Yves Tanguy
