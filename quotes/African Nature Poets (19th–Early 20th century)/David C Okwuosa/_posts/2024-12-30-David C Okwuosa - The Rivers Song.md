The River’s Song

Flowing gently, a silver thread,
The river sings, its secrets spread,
Over pebbles and banks it flows,
A melody where the soft breeze blows.

Listen close to its eternal rhyme,
A story told since the dawn of time,
In its depths, life finds a way,
As the current dances and sways.

- David C Okwuosa
