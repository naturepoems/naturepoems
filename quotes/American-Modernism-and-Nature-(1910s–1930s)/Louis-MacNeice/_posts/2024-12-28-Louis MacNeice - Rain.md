Rain
  
  The rain falls soft upon the ground,  
  A melody in drops resound,  
  Each one a note that sings the earth,  
  A lullaby of life and worth.

  It nourishes the seed that sleeps,  
  Awakens dreams in wholesome heaps,  
  In swaying fields of gentle sway,  
  It whispers to the dawn of day.

- Louis MacNeice
