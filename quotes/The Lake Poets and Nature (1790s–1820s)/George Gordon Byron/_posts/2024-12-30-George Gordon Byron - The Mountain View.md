Upon the mountain's crest I stand,
And gaze upon the world below;
The valleys stretch from hand to hand,
With rivers winding to and fro.

The azure sky, the sun so bright,
The peaks that pierce the clouds above,
All blend together, pure delight,
A feast for eyes, a song of love.

So let me breathe the fragrant air,
As nature wraps her arms around;
In silence, let me offer prayer,
To praise the beauty that I've found.

- George Gordon Byron
