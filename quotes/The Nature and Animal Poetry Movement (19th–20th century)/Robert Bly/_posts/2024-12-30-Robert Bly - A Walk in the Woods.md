A Walk in the Woods

In the hollows of the woods,  
I find my soul echoing,
Among the winding vines,  
The presence of the ground  
Beneath my feet,  
The whispers of leaves  
Speak of silent truths.

A bird sings far above,  
Chiming in the cool breeze—  
Such freedom here,  
As I drift beneath branches,  
Past trunks ancient and wise,  
The wild places open my mind,  
They set my spirit free.


- Robert Bly
