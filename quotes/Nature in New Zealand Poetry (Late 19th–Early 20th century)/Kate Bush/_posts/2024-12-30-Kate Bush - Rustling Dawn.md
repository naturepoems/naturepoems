Morning breaks like a painted dawn,
each shade a story, each hue a dream.

The sky blushes at the kiss of sunlight,
a lover awakening to the world anew.

Birds take flight, weaving patterns of grace,
a ballet across the endless blue expanse.

In the quiet stillness of the hour,
hear the pulse of the earth as it breathes.

- Kate Bush
