Autumn Dreams

With autumn's touch, the world transforms,
As leaves cascade in fiery hues,
The air imbued with whispered charms,
As nature tips its hat, renews.

In fields of gold, the harvest waits,
A bounty rich, bestowed, divine,
And twilight's glow, it resonates,
In every corner, the stars align.

Let gentle breezes spin their tales,
As branches sway, and shadows play,
In this enchanted, golden veil,
The spirit of the earth holds sway.

Oh autumn dreams, so bright, so dear,
With each soft sigh, you hold me tight,
Through nature's lens, my soul draws near,
In the beauty of your fading light.

â€“ Nikolai Gumilyov
