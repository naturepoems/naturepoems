The sun dips low, kindling flames of dusk,
Painting the sky in shades of deep rose,
As the day whispers gently goodbye,
And the night wraps the world in a prose.

The first star flickers, a spark of hope,
In the tranquility that vastness bestows,
A moment suspended in nature's embrace,
Where dreams are born from the silence that grows.


- Anna Akhmatova
