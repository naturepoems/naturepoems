Starlit skies at summer's end,
Where darkness wraps the earth in night,
And all the scattered dreams transcend,
To join the cosmos, pure delight.

Each twinkling light, a wish has flown,
With every heartbeat, love is sown;
The universe, a boundless sea,
In nature's arms, we find the key.


- W H Auden
