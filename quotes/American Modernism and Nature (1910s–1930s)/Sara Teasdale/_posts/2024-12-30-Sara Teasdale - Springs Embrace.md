The blossoms create a soft noise,
on the soft breath of a morning breeze.
They sway like dancers,
caught in life's delicate rhythm.

Honeybees hum a sweet tune,
while butterflies flutter and float.
The beauty of this moment
seems to stretch beyond time.

All is alive in the sun’s embrace,
a perfect blend of color and sound,
reminding us, always, that life—
yet sacred—comes in whispers.

- Sara Teasdale
