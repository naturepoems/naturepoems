Songs of the Ocean

The ocean roars with ancient song,
Its waves caress the sandy shore,
In rhythmic dance, they weave along,
A tale of love, of loss, of lore.

Each tide that ebbs, each tide that flows,
Holds secrets deep, of worlds unseen,
In salty air, our spirit grows,
With ocean's breath, we find our dream.

- Marigold Johnson
