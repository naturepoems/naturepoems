The tide,
a shiver on the shore,
gathers all the echoes,
every calling heart
that swells beneath the stars.

O ocean's gentle touch,
returning and roaming,
you hold the pale blue
and shape the white foam
beneath your stolen light.

Where the shell lies open
and secrets hide,
the quiet echoes
sing to rocks,
those smooth stones,
that can taste the world.

Give me the splash
to awaken,
for I am lost,
yet founded in a dream,
alone in the sound,
where the waters yield
the breath of memory.
