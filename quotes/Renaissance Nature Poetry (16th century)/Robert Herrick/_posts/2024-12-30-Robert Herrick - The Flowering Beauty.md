Thus smother me in Love - Sweet Hollyhocks,
And with their fragrance, comb my hair;
For every flower that richly unlocks,
Holds softness deep, my heart yearns there.

To feel the gentle breeze the blossom flings,
Let time entwine in natureâ€™s art;
Let every ripening dream be what it brings,
May every touch of petal seize my heart!

- Robert Herrick
