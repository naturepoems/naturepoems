The Garden of Love
I went to the Garden of Love,
And saw what I never had seen:
A Chapel was built in the midst,
And the gates of this Chapel were shut,

And 'Thou shalt not' writ over the door;
So I turned to the Garden of Love,
That so many sweet flowers bore,
And I sighed for the garden of love.

And I saw it in the morning light,
And the light was warm and bright,
But the gardens were empty and bare
For the joy was gone and the flowers were rare.


- William Blake
