In spectral silence,
    the forest breathes,
       secrets etched
        in the bark's embrace.
    Each tree, a sentry,
     witnesses the passage
of time's soft weeping.

     The light weaves
   through whispers,
    stitching the air with
  deep-rooted shadows,

   and petals of thought, 
       timeless and wild.

                     A universe unfolds.

- Max Ernst
