In the early morning mist,
  the dew lies like a hymn
  upon the bent blades of grass.
Each droplet holds a world,
   a slant of light; a lover’s breath,
  inducing reverent silence.

A blossom pushes forth,
   unfurling, fragile but bold,
   while time threads its needle,
  stitching warmth into the air.
  Each pulse of creation, a balm,
   restoring the heart of the earth.

Across the expanse of meadow,
   the horizon softly blurs,
   colors dissolve into whispers,
  where every shadow weaves a story.

In this outstretched canvas,
   embrace me in the morning’s glow;
   we are but transient notes,
   dancing upon the canvas of the infinite.

- Eugène Guillevic
