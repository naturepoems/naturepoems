To the woods I turn my gaze,
Where shadows stretch beneath the trees,
A hidden world of softer ways,
Of rustling leaves and buzzing bees.

In nature’s arms, I find my peace,
The gentle sway of every bough,
Where time’s quick march begins to cease,
And wonder blesses every vow.

- from "To the Woods"

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
