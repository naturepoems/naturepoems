O simple glade! where the ancients’ shade
Enfolds thy shimmered floor—
From fount of love, the heavens above
Breathe peace, and nothing more.

Where sweet moss, like velvet frail,
Soothes tired limbs, and cool doth veil
The robins’ notes—far down the vale
The sounds of falling water wail;

- George Edward Woodberry
