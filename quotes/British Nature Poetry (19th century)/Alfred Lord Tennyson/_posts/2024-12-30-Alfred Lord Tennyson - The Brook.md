The Brook

I come from haunts of coot and hern;
   I make a sudden sally
And sparkle out among the fern,
   To bicker down a valley.

By twenty bends, a twinkling, I
   At length am made a river;
For men may come and men may go,
   But I go on for ever.

I drain the swamp and filter through
   The shires, I join the brimming river,
   For men may come and men may go,
   But I go on for ever.

I am the fountain of the river,
   But my waters are for all,
I run to the sea, I flow to the earth,
   For I am a river for all.

I leave my silvery bed behind,
   And dance along the gorge,
For men may come and men may go,
   But I go on for ever.

I arrive from the glen where the sun is shy,
   And I wrench the wood to the brink,
For I am the roar in the timber.
   For men may come and men may go,
   But I go on for ever.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
