SYMPHONY

I
As the great world breaks at morn  
With its time of nature’s scorn  
And the hour upon the hill  
Makes all the world stand still;  
Then, the breezes clear and wide  
Float along as a gusty tide.

II
O lively, playful fount  
Where night and day are wont  
To dance and sing as two  
That share a purpose true;  
From the California rose  
To the sea's blue velvet clothes.

III
Now at evening's rapture sweet  
I hear the song with feet  
That touches the flute of air  
And bends my heart to prayer.
