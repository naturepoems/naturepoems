In the Mountains
I dwelt in a valley, a still wild retreat,
Where the mountain-tops kissed heaven with majesty sweet.
The sun wakes the flowers, the streams dance with glee,
As the winds play a tune in the branches of trees.
In the shadow, the whispers of faradering leaves
Echo softly the stories the old forest weaves,
And here among crags, I rest with my muse,
For in nature's embrace, thereâ€™s nothing to lose.

- Henry Lawson
