When the sun dips low, painting skies with fire,
And the world becomes a canvas I desire.
The horizon melts in hues of red and gold,
Each sunset a story that silently unfolds.

Quietly I sit, wrapped in twilight’s glow,
Listening to the whispers of the winds that blow.
In this sacred hour, there’s peace to be found,
In the arms of nature, my spirit unbound.


- Siddhartha Giggs
