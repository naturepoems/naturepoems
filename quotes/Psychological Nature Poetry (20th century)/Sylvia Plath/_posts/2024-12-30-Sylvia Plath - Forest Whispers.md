The forest is a living thing
  Weaving its own desires,
  Its intentions, long and slow
  As it ebbs and flows with the moon
  That pulls me close, to listen â€”
  A whisper of rustling, hushed beats,
  The sound of ancient knowledge,
  Decked with glistening dew,
  Each leaf waiting to turn.
  Can you feel the stir of secrets?

- Sylvia Plath
