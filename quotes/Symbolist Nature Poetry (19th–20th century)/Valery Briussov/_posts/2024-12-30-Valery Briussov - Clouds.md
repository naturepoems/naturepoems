Clouds

Drifting on the azure sea,
The clouds, like dreams that softly stray,
Creation’s whispers, wild and free,
In endless dance, they find their way.

With silver edges, they caress,
The lengths of sunlit hills and fields,
Veiling the earth in soft finesse,
A fleeting symphony that yields.

As shadows stretch, the sunset glows,
An artist’s stroke on canvas wide,
In every hue, the beauty flows,
While night descends, and dreams confide.

So watch the clouds, oh, let them soar,
Their quiet message, soft and true;
In every form, a mind to explore,
The drifting thoughts, the endless blue.
