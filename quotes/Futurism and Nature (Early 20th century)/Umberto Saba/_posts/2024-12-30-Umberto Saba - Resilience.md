A single flower blooms,
Defying the pavement’s gray embrace,
A beacon of color, a warrior’s heart,
It tells of resilience, of life’s strange grace.

With petals soft as whispers,
It stands alone, yet not lonely,
For in its steadfast presence,
Lies the spirit of the wild, unyielding.

To bloom amidst concrete’s harshness,
Is to shout of hope, of earth’s gentle call,
A reminder that beauty can find a way,
In the face of struggle, we rise, we stand tall.

- Umberto Saba
