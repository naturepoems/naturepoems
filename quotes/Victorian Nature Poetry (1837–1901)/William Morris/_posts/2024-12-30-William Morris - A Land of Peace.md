A land where hushed the silence rest,
Where mountains soar and rivers run,
With every breeze that comes alive,
Will find the heart, till day is done.

For in that land, beyond the hills,
Where quiet dwellings greet the morn,
The sweetest peace, a heart's delight,
Where nature blooms as all is born.

- William Morris
