A Dream
'Tis but a dream that I have dream'd:
A vision of Peace lands bright,
Of mouths of very child and maid,
Of curling fern and yellow wild-
Flower plucked for a promise true:—
\nAre these not made, by nature's voice,
For some, for me, beneath the skies,
Where joy beyond the bounds can rise,
And I, with no regrets, rejoice?
\nOh if I can but find the way,
To live such days as I can weave,
In very silence, free from strife
And ill foreboding every day,
Ha! here’s the sword and here’s the shield,
For nature's soul I must not yield.

- George Meredith
