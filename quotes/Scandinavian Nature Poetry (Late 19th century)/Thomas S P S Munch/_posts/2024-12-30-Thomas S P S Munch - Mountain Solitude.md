Mountain Solitude
High upon the crags I stand,
where the eagles dare to soar,
clouds cradle cliffs with tender hands,
and silence reigns forevermore.

Below, the valleys tapestry,
a patchwork quilt of green and gold,
in the breath of wind, a mystery
whispers softly from days of old.

Nature’s solitude envelops me,
a lover’s bosom, vast and deep,
within its arms, I feel the glee
af life’s transient blessings, sweet and steep.


- Thomas S P S Munch
