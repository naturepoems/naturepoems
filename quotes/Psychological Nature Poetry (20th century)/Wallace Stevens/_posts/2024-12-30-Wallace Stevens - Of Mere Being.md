Of Mere Being

The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands in the square of the sky.
The palm stands in the sun.

The palm stands in the quiet sea,
The palm stands still in the last golden hour
Only a few breaths long.

There is a part of palm that lies
Behind the lap of the oceans,
The palm is full of possibility,
Its development compels this thought.

The palm, with its green component all about,
The palm is even greater than water:
Not a speakable thought shall reveal her, her pause,
As if she could not reveal, as if her silence,
This silence of mere being.

The palm is more to become, where will
Be hills with no end, and things that move,
Stand in their time peace.  The palm is fine,
The palm where innumerable hands unfold.

- Wallace Stevens
