In the Meadow
Amidst flowers, the sun lays down,
blankets of gold across the green.
Bees hum their busy tune,
as butterflies flit whimsically.
Each blade is a tiny world,
every petal a story to tell,
the magic of life hums softly,
in this realm where the earth smiles.
Here, I can feel peace,
as I immerse in natureâ€™s embrace.


- Julian Tuwim
