The Moon at Night
Above the night like a silver dome,

The moon gazes with serene regard,

Gilding blooms with its soft-lighted touch,

Bringing peace, bathing worlds unmarred.

The trees hold silence against the sky,

Wings of owls whispering of dark lore,

As rivers shimmer with fractured stars

In the stillness of tribulations at the shore.

Even shadows grow gentle in its light,

Existing within a luminous dream;

Here, all secrets find release,

In the moment's tender, celestial scheme.

- John Gould Fletcher
