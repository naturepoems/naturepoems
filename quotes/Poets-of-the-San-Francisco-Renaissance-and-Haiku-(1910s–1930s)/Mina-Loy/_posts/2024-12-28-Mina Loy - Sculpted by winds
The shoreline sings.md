The shoreline sings"

author: Mina Loy
quote: "Sculpted by winds,
The shoreline sings softly,
A rhythm of waves collides,
Crafting sand into small seashells — 
Whispers of brine and moonlight,
As twilight slides into night,
Star patterns gleam over darkness,
The universe settled within tides,
Each a secret waiting,
Written by the cosmos."

Sculpted by winds,
The shoreline sings softly,
A rhythm of waves collides,
Crafting sand into small seashells — 
Whispers of brine and moonlight,
As twilight slides into night,
Star patterns gleam over darkness,
The universe settled within tides,
Each a secret waiting,
Written by the cosmos.
