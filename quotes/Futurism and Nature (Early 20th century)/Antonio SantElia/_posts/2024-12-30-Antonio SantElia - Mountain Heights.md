Mountain Heights
Rising tall, the mountains stand,
Guardians of this ancient land.
Veiled in mist, their peaks reach high,
Touching dreams of endless sky.

Rugged stones, a timeless throne,
In their shadows, our hearts have grown,
Natureâ€™s strength, a silent guide,
In their vastness, we confide.


- Antonio SantElia
