The Grass so little has to do –  
A sphere of simple Green –  
Yet enough, to take the Sun  
And show the skies its sheen –  

And so it is that I have found  
The tranquil, vivid space  
Where Nature sheds her tears of dew  
And every thought has grace –  

Though little, yet great in kind,  
The breeze, the bloom, the bee,  
Make up for all the world's great noise  
And give the heart a plea –

- Emily Dickinson
