---

From the woodland's depths arise,  
The sounds of birds in joyous flight,  
Where golden sun through branches sighs,  
And nature revels in the light.

The flowers bloom, as if to sing,  
In colors vibrant, bright, and gay,  
Each petal whispers to the spring,  
Rejoicing in the brand new day.

- John Everett Millais
