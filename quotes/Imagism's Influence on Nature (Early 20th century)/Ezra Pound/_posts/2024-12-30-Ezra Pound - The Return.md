Through the fields; never coming back;
Often passing the trees; silence,
And the winds that gather at twilight,
Rising in their plaintive chorus.
Abandon not the shores of now,
The dawn shall batter and banish the light,
In echoes of the heart;
An old depth; born beneath,
In every flower constantly deep,
And echoing only from itself, gently display,
And shall bring your paths at last.

- Ezra Pound
