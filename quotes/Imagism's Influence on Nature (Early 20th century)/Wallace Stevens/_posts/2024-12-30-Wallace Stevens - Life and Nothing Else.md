Life and Nothing Else

The beauty that is known in the light,
And the dark that curls into the grass,
Is the echoes of the smallest act,
The petaled foliage forever there,
As an uncompleted song, grasps the world.

So that one lives and sees,
Conversations with the bright matter,
And on the withering petals of leaves.


- Wallace Stevens
