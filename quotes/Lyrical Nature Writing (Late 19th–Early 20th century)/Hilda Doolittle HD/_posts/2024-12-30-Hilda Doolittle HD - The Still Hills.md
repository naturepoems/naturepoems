O you who lie so still,  
That I can feel your silence,  
Hills silent as the starlight,  
Another world upturned;  
O you who hold me, the hills;  
I have kissed your misty veils,  
I have wished upon your skies  
That another time might come,  
When pearls would drift,  
Like seaweed borne by tides,  
Your green, white  
In answer to the stillness.
