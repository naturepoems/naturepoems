The Sea

The Sea, my great companion,
Rises and falls, with the tides of time,
Its breath against the rocks,
A symphony of wildness,
Where the waves crash and roar,
A reminder of the struggle,
Of the human heart set against the pulse
Of something so infinitely greater.

In its depth, I see reflections,
The countless souls who've loved,
The heartbreaks hidden in its depths,
And as I stand upon the shore,
I let the spray wash over me,
As the golden sun kisses my face,
And I find my place within this vastness,
A part of infinityâ€™s wild embrace.

- D H Lawrence
