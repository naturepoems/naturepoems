The Mountain

O lofty peak, thou grand ascent,
In silence speak to me alone;

With every step, my heart, content,
Finds solace in your weathered stone.

In every shadow where I tread,
Your majesty unveils a path;

In nature's realm, no fear, no dread,
As peace pervades my quiet faith.


- Philip Freneau
