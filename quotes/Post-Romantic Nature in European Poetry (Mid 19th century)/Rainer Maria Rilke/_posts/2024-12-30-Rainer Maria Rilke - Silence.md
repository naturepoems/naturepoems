Silence

There is an echo lying awake
to a breath whose touch lingers therenear kin. 
Yet silence blurs everything,
where even the dreams gather,
apart from the unwanted noise,
for hearts like yours, even love,
near scale the voiceless so deep, 
to watch once more,
while the leaves surrender,
sound like so many cloudy tears. 

Let life be light, let wander
and let calm embrace,
for we are part of peace,
sweet from the flower's callâ€”
it all depends on what we embrace,
allow moonlight to tug on our souls. 


- Rainer Maria Rilke
