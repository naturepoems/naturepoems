Each and All

Little thinks, in the world so wide,  
That a rose encased all summer's day,  
A friend where the virtues abide,  
Each and all, here are given away.  

To smell in another bloom nearby,  
In asking my heart for another's rise,  
Is weeding soon; which must be  
The night-verging stars conspiring a sigh.  
- Ralph Waldo Emerson
