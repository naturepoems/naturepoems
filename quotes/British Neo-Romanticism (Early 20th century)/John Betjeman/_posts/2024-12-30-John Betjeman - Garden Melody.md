A garden blooms with tender care,
Where roses blush and lilies sway,
Each petal whispers dreams to share,
In sun-drenched warmth, they weave their play.

The colors burst, a canvas bright,
As honeybees hum sweet and low,
With every breath, the pure delight,
In Natureâ€™s grace, we learn to grow.

- John Betjeman
