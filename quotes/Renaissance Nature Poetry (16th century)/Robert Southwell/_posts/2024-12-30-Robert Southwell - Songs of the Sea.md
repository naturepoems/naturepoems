The sea reflects the sky’s embrace,
As waves dance with an endless grace;
The whispering tides that come and go,
Tell tales of love from long ago.
Where seabirds sing and waters play,
In nature’s rhythm, we drift away;
A bond with earth and skies above,
In every wave, we find our love.

- Robert Southwell
