In the Forest  
  --------------  
In the forest where those shadows roam,  
  The birds are singing tipsy songs,  
And love is between the trees—  
  I chase the wild and free,  
And all that is lost beside the road  
Is borne away,—from sight,  
But I know they have come.  
  I can hear them echo in my heart,  
As I wonder why I walked  
From shadow to light,  
  And swam in the wild.  


- Edna St Vincent Millay
