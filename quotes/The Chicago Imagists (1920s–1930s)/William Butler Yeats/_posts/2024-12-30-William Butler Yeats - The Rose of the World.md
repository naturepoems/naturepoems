The Rose of the World

But what is there so perfect and radiantly dead?
  With wooded grass and mist, and fruits staggered and bleared.
When the sun dissolves his mourning mango,
  The drunken birds above drift limitless, unimpaired.

Beneath a moon, upon whose brow this moonlit head
  Wears withering wings that taper beneath the cries,
I may roam on life — the moon or the measure said —  
  While making barren murmurs in a hushed retreat.

Let our voices mingle with such superficial air!
  I soñ mainds not the parting veil
Of old, when they, lost in night, were paid off trust of care.
  But we'll praise algabr as sweet as every kind of day.

Where we dream amidst such ignorant gales,
The oppression finds and steals rolling in too
Let us wake in unnumber'd hours nestled in a tune.


- William Butler Yeats
