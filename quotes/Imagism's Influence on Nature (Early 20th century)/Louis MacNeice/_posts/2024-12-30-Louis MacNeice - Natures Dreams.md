The wind is a gentle waft of sighs;
Through valleys of beauty it threads and twines;
The grasses bend low, echoing the skies,
And the rhythm of nature within me aligns.

There is wonder in every line drawn,
From the folds of the hills and the flowing streams;
In each gentle hush of the light grey dawn,
Awakens the power of all my dreams.


- Louis MacNeice
