The sea is calm tonight.
The tide is full, the moon lies fair
Upon the straits; on the French coast, the light
Glimmers and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,
Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.
Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!
Only, from the long line of spray
Where the sea meets the moon-blanched land,
Listen! you hear the grating roar
Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,
At their return, up the high strand,
Begin, and cease, and then again begin,
With tremulous cadence slow, and bring
The eternal note of sadness in.

Sophocles long ago
Heard it on the Aegean, and it brought
Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow
Of human misery; we find also
In the sound a thought, hearing it by this moonlight,
But one that is not ours, not human;â€“
Along with it, the loss, the lack of beauty
Draws from our closed heart a sigh, a breath of pain.
We reflect on the whispering winds and waves
But that they mean nothing, they have no voice.

The sun is a phantom, old and dreary;
The moon a mere accident of light.
We return to our lives adrift.
We walk our pathways, our own beaches,
Yet we cannot find
What knowledge of happiness flows,
Its pride, its beauty.
We will return to our drifting ways,
The sea is calm tonight.

- Matthew Arnold
