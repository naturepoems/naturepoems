I see the sky blush, I see the clouds dark,
I see the glimmering lake, the willow tree,
And the boughs gently bowing their heads in the park,
Come, sit, O Pansy, with me.

I see the white boats on the rippling tide,
The birds on the wing, the waves in a dance;
And the sunlight streaming, scattering far and wide,
Come, sit, O Pansy, perchance.

I see the wild roses and violets bloom,
The hum of the bees, the songs in the air;
And I sigh for the peace of the sylvan gloom,
Come, sit, O Pansy, and share.

I see the green hills, the valleys so fair,
I see the pine trees standing like spires;
And I feel such a longing—O can you compare
Come, sit, O Pansy, my desires?

- William Wordsworth
