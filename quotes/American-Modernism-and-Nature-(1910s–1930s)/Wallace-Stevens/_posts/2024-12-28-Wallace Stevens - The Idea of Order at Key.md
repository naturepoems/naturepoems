The Idea of Order at Key West
She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind
Of man; it was on the wind's memorable line.
And (savouring this, that) knew
Of no inherent meaning at all;
She sung with a lowering voice, unreal,
Alive with life and livelier still.

And I, like you, on the land,
Could have imagined no better thing
Within the limits of this place
Than that we both see and sing,
The marvelous and the unseen/Alouette, mes. Amies.
They, a fiesty anadyne,

- Wallace Stevens
