Among the ruins where wild things grow,
Ancient stones tell tales of yore;
Of battles fought, and loves that flowed,
In nature’s hand, they’ll write once more.

So let the vines reclaim the past,
Let the flowers break through the stone;
For life will always find a way,
In every heart, we’re not alone.


- Elsie D F Rogerson
