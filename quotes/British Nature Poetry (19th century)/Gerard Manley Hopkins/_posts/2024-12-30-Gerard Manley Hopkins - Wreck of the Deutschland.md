Wreck of the Deutschland

Thou mastering me  
God! giver of breath and bread;  
World’s strand, sway of the sea;  
Listen, I have not shed  
The stain nor tarnish of my sins,  
Yet shall be tried, draped,  
Bounteously lost: ease and yield  
For thee to give a space where zeal  
Can breathe soft scented thorns,  
As ocean faces bless this earth.

— Gerard Manley Hopkins
