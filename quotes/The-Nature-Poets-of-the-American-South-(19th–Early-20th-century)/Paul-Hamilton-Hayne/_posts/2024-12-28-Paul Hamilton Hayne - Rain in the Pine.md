Rain in the Pine Woods

Once more the woods are hushed beneath the rain,
Once more the landscape blooms, for every bough
Is heavy with the tears of heaven, and the pain
Of strangled thirst hath vanished, whose woe
Choked the summers that flourished, brown and dry,
And quenched the song-bird in the wilderness—
Now from the white clouds' bosom drops the sigh
Of plenteous blessings, quickening every grass
That veils the woodlands, rustling coats of green;
And all that grows upon the forest floor
Shakes off the dust of long and penitent days,
To dress anew its beauty, as of yore.
