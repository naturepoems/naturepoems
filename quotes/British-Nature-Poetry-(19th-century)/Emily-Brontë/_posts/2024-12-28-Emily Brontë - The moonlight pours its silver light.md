The moonlight pours its silver light, 
And casts the shadows still,
Upon the trees, so dense and bright;
Each bough a heart to fill.

The zephyrs sing of secrets kept, 
While dew upon the grass,
Awakens stirrings, long since slept,
And bids the night to pass.

O varied night! your velvet cloak, 
I hear you whisper low;
Your shines imbue the dreams invoked, 
In wild and vibrant flow. 


- Emily Brontë
