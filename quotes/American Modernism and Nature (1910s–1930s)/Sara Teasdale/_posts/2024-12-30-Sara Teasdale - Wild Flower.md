The wild flower in the sun so bright
blooms in its fragile beauty,
its color sings against the daily grind
of stone and gray browed labor.

Wind invites it to dance,
to sway on its stalk,
to giggle with bees
who flutter in the air.

We learn from the bloom
that joy can thrive,
even in the barren days,
in shadows made of stone.

- Sara Teasdale
