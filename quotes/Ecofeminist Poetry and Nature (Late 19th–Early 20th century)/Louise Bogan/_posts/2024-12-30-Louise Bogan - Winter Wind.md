Winter Wind  
Through the frozen alleys  
   where shadows brooding lean  
on naked boughs,  
the wind,  
   sharp as winter’s breath,  
scatters all my thoughts  
   across the sky, leaving  
a breadcrumb trail of dreams,  
   each a whispered song,  
atop the wintered layers  
   of frost-edged hope.

- Louise Bogan
