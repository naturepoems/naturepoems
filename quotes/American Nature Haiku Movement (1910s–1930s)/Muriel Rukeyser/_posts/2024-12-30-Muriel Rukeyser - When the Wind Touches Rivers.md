When the wind touches rivers,
I lay my body here,
in the mud, watching the grace
            of reeds unfolding.
They whisper
of mysteries woven into the flow,
crossing each branch’s fingertip gliding across.

A cluster of pearls surface,
        each with a echoing drip,
filling the air with ripples,
lasting for mere moments,
then lost again, swept back out.

Yet every pulse is captured,
every breath a push toward light.
We are dainty, and each leaf knows how
to cradle its story in the bend of the stem
thusted up toward the song of stars.

- Muriel Rukeyser
