Dance, dry leaves,
dance with the fire,
turn to ash, and blow away,
where the trees whisper
a tune to the winter,
a melody of memory,
filling spaces,
dissolving time.

How they entwined
offer pure possibility
in the balmy embrace
of twilight moments,
how they awaken,
and the earth understands,
we cast a story forward,
where every pulse
is measured with wonder,

We are the verses, the songs,
a culmination of breaths and dreams,
and the vibrant dance of water's edge,
echoing into consciousness,
letting the heart roam free.


- Anne Waldman
