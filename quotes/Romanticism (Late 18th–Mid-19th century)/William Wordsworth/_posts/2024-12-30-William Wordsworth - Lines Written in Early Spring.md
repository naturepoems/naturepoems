I’ve seen the woods, and I’ve seen the fields,
And I’ve walked along that mossy hill,
Where wind and sky the harmony yields,
And joy blooms in the quiet thrill.

In every brook and every daisy,
In every leaf upon the tree,
I find the song life sings so easy,
The peace of Nature sings to me.

Each morning shines with golden rays,
Each moment is a treasure rare,
Where echoing hills and sunny ways
Invite the heart to linger there.

And when the day is done and past,
When shadows dance beneath the moon,
I feel the power that Nature casts,
In endless nights that softly croon.

O blissful woods, O gentle hills,
In your embrace I find my peace,
In every breath my spirit fills,
In Nature's arms my soul's release.

- William Wordsworth
