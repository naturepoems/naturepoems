A Windswept Dream

The wind goes wild with joy;  
it sweeps away  
my raven hair  
now flying above the land.  
It takes fragrance, meandering;  
it reminds me of  
the waves of the sea,  
the salty depths of life.  

We chase the path of roses,  
became shores against  
a lush curve of old palms.  
The sun grows curious,  
folk wild residing there,  
but I am nameless,  
and my exposed soul swims  
between the bushes sparse,  
manifold of purples and bushel reds.

- Gabriela Mistral
