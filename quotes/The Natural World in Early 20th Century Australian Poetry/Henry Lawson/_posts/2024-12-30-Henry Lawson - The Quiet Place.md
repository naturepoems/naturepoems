The Quiet Place

In the quiet place of dreams,
Where the only sounds are light,
Nature whispers, softly gleams,
Breathing softly: all is right.

Underneath the peaceful trees,
Where the rivers gently flow,
Every heart feels natureâ€™s ease,
In the warmth of sunlit glow.

Here my spirit finds its home,
In the beauty of the day,
And through vast and open loam,
Life and love will find its way.

- Henry Lawson
