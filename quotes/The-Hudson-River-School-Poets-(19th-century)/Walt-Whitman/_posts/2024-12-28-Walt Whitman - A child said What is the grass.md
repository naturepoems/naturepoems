A child said, What is the grass? Fetching it to me with full hands;
How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is, any more than he.
I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green color,
It is the handkerchief of the Lord,
A scented token, as a child from its mother’s knee.

Is it the great covering of the earth,
The seed of the sun's light, alive,
Or is it drawn from the cosmos, a piece of the stars' lore,
That I see, rustling in the breeze, playful, alive,
Dancing like dreams, under the blue sky.

— From "Leaves of Grass"

- Walt Whitman
