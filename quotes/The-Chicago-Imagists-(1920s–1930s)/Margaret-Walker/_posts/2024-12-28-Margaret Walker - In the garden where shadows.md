In the garden where shadows play,
And sunlight scatters in golden rays,
The blooms of spring break through the earth,
To greet the warmth, to cheerly sway.

Each color bright, each fragrant breath,
Life's spirit dances, death's demise,
In perfect harmony, life unfolds,
As nature sings, and beauty flies.

- Margaret Walker
