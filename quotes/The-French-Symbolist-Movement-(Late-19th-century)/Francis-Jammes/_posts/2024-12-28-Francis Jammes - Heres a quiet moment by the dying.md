Here’s a quiet moment by the dying light,
A dusk where petals fold into rest,
Nature, my dear friend, gentle as twilight...
I feel the scents of earth, the nest,
Where birds gather their feathers close, in trust,
As shadows creep upon the velvet grass,
And stars begin to twinkle, reflecting love,
In this tranquil silence, as hours pass.

- Francis Jammes
