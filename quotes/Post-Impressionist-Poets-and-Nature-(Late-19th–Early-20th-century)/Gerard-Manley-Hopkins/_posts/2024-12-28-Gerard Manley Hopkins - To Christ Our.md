To Christ Our Lord

Thou art the green grass, the sun, the pale dews,
  The pure clear hides of the sward where beauty flows –
    Sweet with the birth of the spring, and buoyant as day,
  Lessons learned in opulence from angel planes' lovely rows;
    Ruled on the heart's cheeks; scattered lowers us.

  How shall these tell in all thy grandeur true?
    Who can do it but thee, each day break from veil-
      The dance of the gleam that lifts nearer our love’s sea,
  Where (in distant beauty) the skies wash youth, and purest gaze,
    Life whose trust is the light of the world we seek, O thee.



- Gerard Manley Hopkins
