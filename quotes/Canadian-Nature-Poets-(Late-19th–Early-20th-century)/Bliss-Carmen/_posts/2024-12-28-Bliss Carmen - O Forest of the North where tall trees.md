O Forest of the North where tall trees wave,  
And silence reigns within your mystic shade,  
Like cloisters of a holy sanctuary,  
Where nature’s spirit in her grandeur played;  
I wander through thy paths and loved to hear  
The whisper of the leaves, as soft they weep,  
And let their fragrance come and fill the air  
With memories of realms that lie so deep.

- Bliss Carmen
