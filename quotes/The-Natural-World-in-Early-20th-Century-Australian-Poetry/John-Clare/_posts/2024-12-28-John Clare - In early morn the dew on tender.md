In early morn, the dew on tender grass,
Glistens like diamonds in the sun’s caress,
Each droplet holds a universe so vast,
And nourishes the blooms in pure finesse.

The lark sings high, its melody devout,
Charming the blossoms with sweet notes that soar,
In nature’s choir, a hymn from far and out,
Reminds us of the gifts that earth once bore.

How fair it is, when life’s full arms enfold,
The steadfast heart of nature’s boundless grace,
In every petal, every leaf of gold,
The silence wraps the world in soft embrace.

- John Clare
