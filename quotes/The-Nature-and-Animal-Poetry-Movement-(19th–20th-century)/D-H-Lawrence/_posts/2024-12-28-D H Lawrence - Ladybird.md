Ladybird

O ladybird, come down once more,
From leaves that tremble in the air;
You share your grace on every shore,
A marvel that I owe my care.

In splendor of your scarlet hue,
You paint the world so joyfully,
With black-dotted wings, so bright and true,
You dance in summer's gentle glee.

With all the wilds, I find your place,
Upon the petals softly spread;
A tiny being of timeless grace,
Whose presence lingers though you fled.

- D H Lawrence
