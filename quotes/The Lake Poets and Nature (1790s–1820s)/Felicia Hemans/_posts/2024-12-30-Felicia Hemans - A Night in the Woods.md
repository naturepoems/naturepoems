A Night in the Woods
How many, many sounds arise,
From tree to tree, from earth to skies!
In this dim wood, how sweetly play
The echoes on the ear, so gay.

The silver moon beams from her heights,
The glowworm, too, our fears delights;
The cricket chirps a low refrain,
And bids us leave behind all pain.

- Felicia Hemans
