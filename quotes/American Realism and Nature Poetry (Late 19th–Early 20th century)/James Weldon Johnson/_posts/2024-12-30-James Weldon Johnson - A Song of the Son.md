A Song of the Son

   Lift every voice and sing  
   Till earth and heaven ring,  
   Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;  
   Let our rejoicing rise  
   High as the listening skies,  
   Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.

   Sing a song full of the faith  
   That the dark past has taught us,  
   Sing a song full of the hope  
   That the present has brought us;  
   Facing the rising sun  
   Of our new day begun,  
   Let us march on till victory is won.
