In the Quiet Woods

In quiet woods, where shadows play,
  And sunlight filters through,
The dappled paths, a soft ballet,
  Awaken thoughts anew.

The sylvan scent, a fragrant kiss,
  Of pine and earth combined,
Enfolds the heart in tranquil bliss,
  As peace and love align.

The songbirds rise on whispered wings,
  Their notes a serenade;
Each note in harmony, it sings,
  Nature’s symphony made.

I walk amid this gentle dream,
  With hope that softly glows;
In every stream and silver beam,
  A light the spirit knows.

So let me linger, free as air,
  In nature's soft embrace;
I find my solace waiting there,
  In every wooded place.
