The ocean’s roar is a constant,
A heartbeat of the deep,
Where mysteries abound,
And secrets softly sleep.

Waves crash upon the shore,
In a rhythmic, timeless flow,
Carrying stories of the past,
In every ebb and go.

The sands hold the footprints,
Of those who came before,
In nature’s wild expanse,
We find ourselves once more.

- JP Clark-Bekederemo
