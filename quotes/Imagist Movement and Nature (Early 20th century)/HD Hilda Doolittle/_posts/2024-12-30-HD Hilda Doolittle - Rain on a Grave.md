Rain on a Grave

    Wonder why
          the rain is
in November?
    It comes down
            heavily like
    love’s own heart,
        which is gone
to be alone.

Anyhow, in the end,
       every matter be
washed of tears
    so that it is free of
        the mists and former fears.

Anyhow, feel it rain,
    listen to its rhythm
    tap the bed-fast
that once held love!

There is a grave now hidden—
    a shroud of nature,
            upon the heart,
stirring on to death.
