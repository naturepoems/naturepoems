Sunday Morning

Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her,
This is a blessed gift of time,
With this music of the skies,
Where the heart beats, with every breath.

The morning, still and simple rites
After the night will set us free,
Until the bright achingly cool dead-palm
And the deep sky becomes our only muse.

We hide in silence, yet are hidden,
Shall rise and drink of these,
In melodies that awaken the eye
Bejewelled by the sun’s golden rays.

With grace we walk, and pine, as the canopies,
These trembling gods, the branches dim,
Providing shadows vast where we can know
The life of beauty-life lies everywhere.


- Wallace Stevens
