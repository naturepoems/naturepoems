The Brook
I come from haunts of coot and hern,
I make a sudden sally
And sparkle out among the fern,
To bicker down a valley;

By thirty hills I hurry down,
Or slide between the rocks;
I travel the old heroic town,
And greet the shouting flocks.

I babble on the pebbles gay,
I chatter, chatter, as I flow;
To join the brimming river,
For men may come and men may go,
But I go on for ever.

I climb to join the brimming river,
For men may come and men may go,
But I go on for ever.

I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glide,
I mingle with the river;
I love to see the salty tide
Turn again to the shiver,

I steal by beds and sandy shores,
And though I'm quick and light,
I linger with the moans of oars
That creak throughout the night.

I make the stony beach my bed,
Upon its gray-grim summit,
And play pretend when half in dread
That the earth will close upon it.

For men may come and men may go,
But I go on for ever.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
