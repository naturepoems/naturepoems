The Secluded Grove


  The oaks in a close winding grove,  
  Whose embrace enfolds the fairest moss,  
  Where some day must come our covering love,  
  But a stream’s dart shall solace the loss;  
  In quietude breathes on the sea,  
  To watch worlds fair come and go —  
  I’ll create, my dear darling,  
  That fresh gay heart in the glow.
