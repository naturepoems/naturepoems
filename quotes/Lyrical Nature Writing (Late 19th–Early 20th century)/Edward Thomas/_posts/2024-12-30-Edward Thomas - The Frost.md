The Frost

The frost is white on all the hills,
A blanket soft on earth's good bed,
It covers the fields with crystal trills,
While quiet lies the world, in thread.

Each twig and branch adorned in lace,
A fairy’s touch, a shimmering sheen,
As dawn breaks slow, to show the grace,
Of everything, both bright and green.


- Edward Thomas
