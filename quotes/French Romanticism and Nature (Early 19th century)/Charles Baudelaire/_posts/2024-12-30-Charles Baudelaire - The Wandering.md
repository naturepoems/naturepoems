The Wandering

I roam the roads with no path to follow,  
Through fields where silence echoes hollow;  
The clouds above drift like thoughts in flight,  
As the shadows lengthen to swallow the light.

Yet in this wandering, the heart learns to soar,  
Amidst the stillness, in peace, it explores;  
For nature unveils her resplendent grace,  
In each footstep echoes a sacred trace.

So let me wander, let every step sing,  
For in natureâ€™s embrace, new dreams take wing;  
With each gentle breeze, may my spirit be free,  
In this boundless dance with eternity.

- Charles Baudelaire
