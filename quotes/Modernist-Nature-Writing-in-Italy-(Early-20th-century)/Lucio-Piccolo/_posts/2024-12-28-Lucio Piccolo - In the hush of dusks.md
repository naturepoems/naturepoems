In the hush of dusk’s embrace,
where shadows deepen and colors fade,
I wander along the familiar paths,
footsteps tracing lines in soft marsh.

The willows weep their emerald tears,
framing the water’s edge,
where the moon begins its ascent,
a silver coin tossed upon the dark,
a promise of light in the gathering gloom.

A croaking frog, a distant nightingale,
make their debut as twilight pulls,
its cloak around this gentle world,
years of memories, folded into night,
a tapestry woven of silken echoes,
transitions of spirit and sound.

I breathe in the steam of dusk,
carrying the warmth of day,
and as silence unfurls its wings,
I become a note lost,
just one of many in the symphony of night.

- Lucio Piccolo
