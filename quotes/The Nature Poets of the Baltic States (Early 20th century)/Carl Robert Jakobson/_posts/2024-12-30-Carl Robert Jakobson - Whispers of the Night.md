Whispers of the Night  
In the hush of the twilight,  
a symphony plays,  
stars hum their secrets  
in the still of the days.  
Moonlight weaves stories  
in shadows so deep,  
a tapestry of dreams  
where the night creatures creep.  
Listen close, oh dreamers,  
for the night knows the way,  
hidden paths to wander,  
a new dawn at bay.

- Carl Robert Jakobson
