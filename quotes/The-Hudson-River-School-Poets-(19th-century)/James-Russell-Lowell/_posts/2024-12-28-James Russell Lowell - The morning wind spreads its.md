The morning wind spreads its wings,
And flies from land to land;
The trees are blown about like reeds,
To which the zephyr leans and heeds;
The bosom of the sea
Is spreading itself, deep and wide,
And from the mountain's side,
The river flows with pride, 
In peace and ecstasy,  
Waking the gentle tides.

O! Natureâ€™s breath, the voice of skies,
Resounding on this earth that flies !
I would I were a downy cloud
In the blue arch, above the crowd.
A flower, a stream, a wood, a brook,
To fill the air with music:
Open wide; release my heart,
And stir my senses too, as such.

- James Russell Lowell
