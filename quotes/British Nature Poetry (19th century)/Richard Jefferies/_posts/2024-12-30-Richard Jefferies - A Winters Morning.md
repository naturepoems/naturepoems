A Winter's Morning
The frost adorns each bough and leaf,

A crystal world, a veil of grief,

Yet beauty lies in cold embrace,

Each flake a gem in winterâ€™s grace.

The sun peeks shy through icy drears,

And paints the world with warmth and cheers,

In every glisten, joy is found,

In winter's arms, life does abound.

- Richard Jefferies
