In The Clearing

In the clearing, step softly forward,  
Where the ferns lay auburn in the fall;  
Where hum of crickets start to fade,  
Within the woods where whispers call.  
A perfume spins through every bough,  
The frosty air begs all to breathe;  
Where sentinels of trees do stand,  
Their glowing hues begin to sheath.  
And nature's solace sings within—  
Little beauties dwell and stay;  
O, in my heart I've wild laughter,  
Where nature holds her delicate sway!

- Sarah Orne Jewett
