The Sea

The sea is a black horse,
Wet with the night,
And the moon rides high—
Its white wings bound,
Clinging to the waves,
Until tomorrow's dawn
When the star reflects.
The stars are dark at night,
And the bones of the sea men dwell
In the depths of the waves,
They rise and fall,
Filling the land with lost songs.

- Carl Sandburg
