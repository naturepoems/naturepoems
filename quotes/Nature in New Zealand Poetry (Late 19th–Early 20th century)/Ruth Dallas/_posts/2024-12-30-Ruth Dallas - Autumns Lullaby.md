When summer fades to the softest glow,  
And the leaves begin their slow farewell,  
In the tapestry of time, I know  
I am woven into nature's spell.  

The colors dance in a final blaze,  
As the earth prepares for the winter's rest;  
In this cycle of life, in its myriad ways,  
I find my solace, forever blessed.

- Ruth Dallas
