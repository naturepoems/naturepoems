The quiet, lilting song of the lark,
As the sun reaches out to the sky,
Injects the world with its enchantment;
The fields awakened, depths of green,
Unfolding in the morning mist,
A wondrous serenity,
The balance of earth and air,
As it dances, ever shifting,
With the gentle stirring of the breeze.

- Amy Lowell
