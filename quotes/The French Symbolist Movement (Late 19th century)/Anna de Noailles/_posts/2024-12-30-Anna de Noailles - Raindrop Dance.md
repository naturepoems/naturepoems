Glistening droplets cling to each petal,
A chorus of raindrops dances on rooftops;
Beauty blooms in every moment of stillness,
Nature reveals her treasures in silence.

The embrace of dusk, with colors ablaze,
Carves silhouettes against the evening sky;
In this tapestry of hues and thoughts,
We become a part of natureâ€™s reverie.

- Anna de Noailles
