In the heart of the meadow where daisies grow,
I wandered far on a morning fair,
With the sun kissing softly on cheeks aglow,
And a carpet of blooms spread everywhere.

Butterflies flit through the dappled light,
A ballet of color among the green,
While the breeze whispers secrets, tender and slight,
In the world of nature, pure and serene.

The stream babbles on, a gentle song,
Chasing the rocks in a hurried race,
Here in this haven, I feel I belong,
In the embrace of nature's warm grace.

So let me linger, let me abide,
In the heart of the meadow, forever Iâ€™ll roam,
For in this simple sanctuary, I confide,
And in the heart of nature, I find my home.

- Willa Cather
