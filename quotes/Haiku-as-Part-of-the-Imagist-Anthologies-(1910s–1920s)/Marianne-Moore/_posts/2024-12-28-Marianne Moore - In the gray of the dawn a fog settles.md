author: Marianne Moore
quote: "In the gray of the dawn a fog settles, 
a mischief drifting upon the fields. 
It stirs like whispers in the grass, 
yet no sounds come from the silvered spell -- 
a realm touched solely by one's breath, 
a lonesome distance overflowing with sound."

In the gray of the dawn a fog settles, 
a mischief drifting upon the fields. 
It stirs like whispers in the grass, 
yet no sounds come from the silvered spell -- 
a realm touched solely by one's breath, 
a lonesome distance overflowing with sound.

- Marianne Moore
