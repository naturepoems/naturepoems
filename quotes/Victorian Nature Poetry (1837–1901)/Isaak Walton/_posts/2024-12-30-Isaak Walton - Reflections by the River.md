Upon a river’s silver sheen,
  Where willows weep and eagles soar,
  The murmuring waters sing a tune,
  Beneath the boughs on the forest floor.

The fish breathe life, the lily’s bloom,
  A canopy of thoughts and lore,
  Each ripple seems to chase a dream,
  Within nature’s ever-open door.

- Isaak Walton
