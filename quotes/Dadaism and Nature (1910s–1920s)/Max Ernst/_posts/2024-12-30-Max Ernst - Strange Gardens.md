Strange gardens arise
   in my travels,
   cloaked in shadows of the mind’s eye.
     Insects dance,
     miniature miracles,
      over sleeping planets,

with fractured petals,
breaking apart,
near the silent brook,
     in reflection’s grasp.
        Life murmurs,
        in tiny doses
           the secrets of
                 eternity.

- Max Ernst
