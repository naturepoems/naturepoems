Here lies the reed, and play unto the saxes,
To, and fro, in nature's throng,
When storm and flood yield motion near the rocks;
Sojourning in the mischief weâ€™ve long ago sought.

Ecstasy falls from clouded skies,
With sandy courts that weave and rise,
And all this crafty gold;
As the sleek tongues of mountains tongue;
Let us all, where peace and garlic reign,
Seek in our haste to seek again.

- John Keats
