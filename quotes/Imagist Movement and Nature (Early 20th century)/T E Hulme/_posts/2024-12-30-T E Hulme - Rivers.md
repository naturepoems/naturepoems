Rivers

Beneath white bodies,
Shadows pulsate light,
Where eyes see continents,
Spawn and churn in the clock;
Twist and wind through gnarled banks  
When stillness oft' roams near.

Kin to the roots, woven tight,
Life fettered, but vast;
Branches shake and still stretch
Into the chorus of moss,
That spirals tender threads,  
A calm hand of dusk stretches,
To greet far-flung worlds  
Where touch pulls out into streams.

Life speaks, where body never lands,
Through the quiet strains of streams
And the patterned streets,
Of nature's weeping rings.
