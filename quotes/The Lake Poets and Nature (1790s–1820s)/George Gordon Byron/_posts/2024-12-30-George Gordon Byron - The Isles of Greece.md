There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
There is society, where none intrudes,
By the deep sea, and music in its roar:
I love not Man the less, but Nature more,

From these our interviews, in which I steal
From all I may be, or have been before,
To me the voice of Nature is a peal
Of thunder rolling from the sky to shore;
The winds in its wild sport, the waves' uproar,

And still, as I behold the azure heavens
With their reflections mirrored in the sea;
I think of men, these dogs of strife, and leavens
Of worldly joys, that tempt—weary me!

- George Gordon Byron
