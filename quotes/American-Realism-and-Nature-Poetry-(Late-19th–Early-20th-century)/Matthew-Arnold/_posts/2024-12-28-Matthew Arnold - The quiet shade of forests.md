The quiet shade of forests deep,
The meadows green, the hills of clay,
The path beside the running brook,
As daylight fades, where shall we stray?

Amid the trees the cautious deer
Seek shelter from the warming sun,
While through the glades the soft winds play,
In tune with nature, day is done.

Let us, too, wander hand-in-hand,
And listen to what nature sings,
With every step the world expands,
As serenity on warmth it brings.

Let us rejoice, oh heart sincere,
With colors danced by nature’s brush,
And cherish thoughts that show our care,
For in her arms we feel a hush.

- Matthew Arnold
