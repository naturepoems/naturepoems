In the cool of early morning,
the world unfolds,
its secrets murmured by the trees,
a conversation of shadows and light,
shifting in and out of the mist.

The hills breathe a sigh,
full of remembrance,
like a forgotten lover.

Every blade of grass
is a salute to life,
amidst the silence
that reigns after the rain,
each drop a thoughtful pause,
a reminder that life
is never just one note; it’s a symphony.

- Nadine Gordimer
