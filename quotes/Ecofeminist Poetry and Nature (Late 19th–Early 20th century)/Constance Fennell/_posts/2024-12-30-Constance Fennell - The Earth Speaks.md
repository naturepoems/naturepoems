The Earth Speaks

I am the earth, the ground beneath your feet,
  The roots that anchor strength upon this sphere;
  The laughter in the brook, the pulse of beat,
  I weave your dreams and hold your joys so dear.

The mountains stand as sentinels, so bold,
  Their echoes tell of ages yet to come,
  While valleys sing of stories yet untold,
  I cradle every heartbeat, every hum.

The flowers bloom, in colors radiant and true,
  Through hardy stems, their petals lift in grace;
  The world spins on, and still, I cherish you,
  Within my bosom, find your rightful place.

So pause and ponder, as you trod this land,
  I am the earth—the sky, the sea, the sand.

- Constance Fennell
