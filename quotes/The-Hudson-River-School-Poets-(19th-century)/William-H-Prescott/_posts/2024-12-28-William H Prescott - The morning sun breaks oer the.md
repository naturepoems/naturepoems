The morning sun breaks o’er the hills,
With gold and crimson, painting skies,
Each ray a brush, as daylight spills,
Awakening the world, it sighs.

The rivers dance with liquid light,
And wildflowers bloom in gentle sway,
Nature’s canvas, pure delight,
In harmony, they find their way.


- William H Prescott
