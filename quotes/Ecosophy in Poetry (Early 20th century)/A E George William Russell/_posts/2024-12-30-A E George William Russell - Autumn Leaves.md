Autumn Leaves

The leaves of autumn falling,  
Golden crowns upon the ground,  
Whisper tales of summerâ€™s glory  
In their soft and rustling sound.  
In the dance of the fading embers,  
In the chill of the evening air,  
I feel the breath of the seasons,  
I sense the presence of care.

- A E George William Russell
