When the world is quiet, deep and still,
The shadows fall, the colors yield,
In nature's grace, we find the thrill,
Of whispers drifting across the field.
With every heartbeat, a testament true,
In forests deep and skies so blue,
We join the dance of life, anew,
Bound to the rhythms that nature drew.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
