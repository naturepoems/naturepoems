Autumn Song

The flame of autumn is in the leaves,
The smoke of heaven’s peace is here,
In the golden sun of the harvest sheaves,
A quiet joy for all to share.

Forget the rushing of hours, oh man,
Here’s the rich tranquility of land,
The earth, the seed in the sunlight’s plan,
The lull of the season, the sacred hand.

Embrace the time and let it hold you,
Fall into the golden arms of the ground,
Rest in the beauty that life unfolds too,
Find the peace where all is found.
