My soul is dark—oh! soon abandoned
To the deep bosom of the sea,
On the curve of the deserted sand,
Where the waves go on endlessly;
And I alone, accursed and stranded,
Mocking the universal plea!

My life, all ruined, and in shadow,
Like the ship on the broken reef;
Yet the night has a soft haze of sorrow,
Which peace, and thoughts eternal, leaf
Shall cheer my heart, though far and low
Though beholden to me none can keep.

Within the bosom of the sea,
Where the waves go on endlessly, I rest,
Alone abandoned to lonely glee,
The heartless storm beats at my crest.

- Lord Byron
