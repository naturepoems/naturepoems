Lo! in this threefold nature, man
   Doth feel the Earth embrace;
   The Mountains rise, the rivers span,
   Each delves in time’s own grace.
   Here morning’s light shall break anew,
   In colors rare and bright;
   As nature’s breath flows soft and true,
   In every dream of night.
   The days cascade in vibrant hue,
   The seasons chant of Life,
   As every shadow, wild and blue,
   Reflects the rhythms rife.

- Sarah Orne Jewett
