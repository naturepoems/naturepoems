The Silent Wood

O silent wood, where shadows play,  
  And secrets throng and dwell,  
I hear the whispers of the day,  
  Where the breeze has tales to tell.  
Your majesty looms above me now,  
  As I wander from the light,  
And I find in your timeless arms,  
  A peace that feels so right.

Through mossy paths and tangled vines,  
  I linger, lost in thought,  
And time, it seems, has taken wings  
  In the silence that I sought.  
Here in your heart of verdant green,  
  I lose the weight of care,  
For nature wraps me in her grace,  
  Within the woods so rare.

So let me pause and breathe you in,  
  O sacred, gentle wood,  
In stillness find my spirit's home,  
  And know this life is good.  
For every rustle, every sigh,  
  Is a hymn of reverent song,  
And I, with you, will ever strive  
  To cherish all day long.

- Charles GD Roberts
