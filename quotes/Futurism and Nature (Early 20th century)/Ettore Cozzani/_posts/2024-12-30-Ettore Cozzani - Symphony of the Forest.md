Amidst the towering pines,
The wind carries tales untold,
Of gentle streams,
And secret glades,
Where time curiously slows,
And the heart learns to breathe,
Infusing life into the weary soul.

Here in the heart of the forest,
Nature orchestrates a symphony,
Birds chirrup as conductors,
Frogs croak the bass lines,
While leaves flutter and sway,
Creating harmonies unseen.

Feel the earth beneath,
Cool and welcoming as a dawn,
Sensing rhythms of existence,
Beating in tune with the stars,
Merging the finite with the infinite,
As not a soul is alone here.

In this sacred sanctuary,
Every bough, every rock,
Every glimmer of dewy sunlight,
Whispers the poetry of the ages.
Come hither, and drink deep,
From the well of natureâ€™s soul.

- Ettore Cozzani
