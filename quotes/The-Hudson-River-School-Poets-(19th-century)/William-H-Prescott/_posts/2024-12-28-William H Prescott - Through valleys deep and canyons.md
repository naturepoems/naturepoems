Through valleys deep and canyons wide,
Where echoes bounce on wind’s soft song,
Nature’s beauty does abide,
In every heartbeat, we belong.

The mountains high and rivers strong,
Each whispering leaf tells tales anew,
In every crest, we find our throng,
In nature’s arms, our spirits flew.


- William H Prescott
