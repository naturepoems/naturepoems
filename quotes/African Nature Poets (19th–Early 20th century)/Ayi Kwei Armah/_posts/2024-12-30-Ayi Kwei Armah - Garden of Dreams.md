In the garden of dreams, 
    flowers bloom with abandon, 
    their petals unfurling stories, 
    kissed by the dawn's first light.  

Fragrant scents waft through the air, 
    weaving a tapestry of color, 
    as bees hum softly, 
    gathering the sweetness of life.  

Every leaf is a lover, 
    embracing the gentle caress
    of the wind, 
    as butterflies flutter like thoughts, 
    dancing in the warmth of the day.
