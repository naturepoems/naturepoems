The Vole

I especially liked
the hares and the voles,
round or nearly round, 
a green space for interested parties.
These visitors and grey woolens,
friend of solidity,
open windowsâ€”their easy choice is rust.

Under such golden sun,
this creature skims unto
the droppings of its natural ease.
Birds confer while 
each streak unravels.


- Marianne Moore
