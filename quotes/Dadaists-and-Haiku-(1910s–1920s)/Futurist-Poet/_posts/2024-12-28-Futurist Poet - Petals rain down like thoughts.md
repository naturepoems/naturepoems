author: Futurist Poet
quote: "Petals rain down like thoughts unspoken,
Colors collide, a world now broken.
The river runs wild, a stream of dreams,
In fragmented moments, nothing's as it seems.

A clock ticks loudly in the hush of night,
Challenging the stars, seeking their light.
In tangled roots, life's laughter lies,
Beauty dances in the chaos that flies."

Petals rain down like thoughts unspoken,
Colors collide, a world now broken.
The river runs wild, a stream of dreams,
In fragmented moments, nothing's as it seems.

A clock ticks loudly in the hush of night,
Challenging the stars, seeking their light.
In tangled roots, life's laughter lies,
Beauty dances in the chaos that flies.
