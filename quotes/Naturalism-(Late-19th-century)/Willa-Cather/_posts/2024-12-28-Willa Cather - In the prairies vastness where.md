In the prairie’s vastness, where horizons meet,
A tapestry woven of gold and deep blue,
The wind whispers secrets at my wandering feet,
Carrying stories both old and new.

The sun hangs low, casting shadows long,
While the grass sways gently in a silken dance,
Nature sings softly, a timeless song,
Of the beauty in creation, of life’s expanse.

With each step I take, I feel the earth breathe,
The pulse of the land in its quiet refrain,
In this open space, my spirit finds ease,
A refuge of solace, free from the pain.

For out in the wild, I discover the truth,
That we are but travelers on this grand stage,
And in nature’s embrace, as simple as youth,
Lives the essence of life, in every age.

- Willa Cather
