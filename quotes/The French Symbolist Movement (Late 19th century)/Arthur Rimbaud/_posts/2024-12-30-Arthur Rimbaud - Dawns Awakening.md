In the quietude of dawn's first light,
The world awakens from night’s soft shroud;
Each flower blooms in vibrant colors,
Beneath the gaze of a golden cloud.

The air is fresh, alive with promise,
As nature stretches and takes a breath;
In the warm embrace of morning,
Life reassures us that there's no death.

So walk among the blooms and leaves,
Let your spirit soar on invisible wings;
For in the realm of nature’s beauty,
The heart learns what true freedom brings.

- Arthur Rimbaud
