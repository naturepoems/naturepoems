River’s Whisper
The river flows gently, a silver thread,
Whispering tales of the life it’s led.
Through meadows and valleys, it hums a tune,
Nature's own melody, beneath the moon.

Reflecting the sky in twilight’s embrace,
Each ripple a story, a time-lost trace.
Here by its banks, I find solace, a balm,
In the river’s soft whisper, a moment of calm.

- Alexei Kruchyonykh
