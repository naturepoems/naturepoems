The Treasure

When the sun beams brightly, strong, and bold,
And splendor spills from the sheen of gold,
I wander through Nature, pure and bright,
Uniting myself with her rhythm and light.
Thousands of wonders around me unfold,
A living treasury, more bright than gold.

A new world floods through my veins; I blend
With this world, and Time itself becomes my friend.
Yet in glorious light, I understand,  
Life’s greatest treasures lie not in the hand,
But in the love for the soft song of day,
And the gentle night that whispers away.
—Sidney Lanier
