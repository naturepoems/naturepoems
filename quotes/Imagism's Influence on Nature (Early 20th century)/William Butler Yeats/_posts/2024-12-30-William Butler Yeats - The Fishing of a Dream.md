The Fishing of a Dream
As I lay dreaming on the sea,
A voice from the water singing hearkened me.
Oh, see the fishes come swimming through,
Their scales like gems, their eyes like dew.

With silver nets and golden hooks,
I chased them down the deep streams and brooks,
But when I reached the sparkling sheen,
The waters laughed and spoke, not seen.

'The fishes swim through shadows bright,
Where the dreams of men meet the morning light.'

- William Butler Yeats
