Oft I sit, where the shadows play,
Where sunlight filters through the leaves,
And with each breath of earth's bouquet,
The spirit of peace gently weaves.

Here I find life's gentle song,
In the rustle of the leafy vine,
Where harmony and love belong,
In nature's beauty, pure and divine.

- Jean Blewett
