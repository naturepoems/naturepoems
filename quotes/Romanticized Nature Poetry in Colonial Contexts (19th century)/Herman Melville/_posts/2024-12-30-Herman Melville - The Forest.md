The Forest
In the heart of the forest, shadows lie,
Where ancient trees weave tales of old,
And silence serves as a lullaby,
For souls who seek the truth untold.

Each rustling leaf, a story spun,
In emerald hues, where life prevails,
A sanctuary for everyone,
As nature dances in the trails.

With whispers soft, the breeze invites,
The wanderer to lose their way,
Among the starlit, moonlit nights,
Where magic lives in every sway.

So build a pathway through the wood,
And lose your cares among the pines,
For in this place, the heart is good,
And nature’s gift, it intertwines.

— Excerpt from "The Forest" (not an actual poem of Melville)

- Herman Melville
