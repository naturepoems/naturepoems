O read me
- A single breeze lifts
the delicate twig,
turns to the left
- as if I might touch
herâ€”
- oh slender,
tender and restless,
you break the silence; 
you fly -
and no touch
keeps you, only
as the breath of a flower,
in the long afternoon- 
in tiny summer,
as the trembling
of the white star,
its petals  
deepening into night.

- HD Hilda Doolittle
