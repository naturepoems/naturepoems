Mid-Day

     The heat,
     the sun sinking
     into its summer
     and crumbling,  
     baked like ships
     resting in the water's brown,  
     and the fly drumming, 
     and falling into the dust
     burning, 
     dust of the pipes,
     and the gardens 
     of birds,  
     or of the nettles
     and the stone's high
     invisible motion.
