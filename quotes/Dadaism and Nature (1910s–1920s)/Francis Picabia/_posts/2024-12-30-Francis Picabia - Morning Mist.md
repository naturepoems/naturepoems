Morning Mist
A veil of mist kisses the ground,
a soft whisper of morning,
where the sun learns to awake.

Dewdrops cradle under leaves,
a symphony of silence,
each drop a tiny universe,
a shimmer of possibility.

Nature breathes a gentle sigh,
a moment frozen in time;
we, mere shadows, dance in its glow,
reflecting the stillness within.

- Francis Picabia
