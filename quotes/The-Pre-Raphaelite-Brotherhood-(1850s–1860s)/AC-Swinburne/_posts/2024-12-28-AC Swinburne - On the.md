On the Grain
In gardens where shadows float down, there are dreams–
Softly borne on the brown of abundance, like mist.
And the flocks are intermingled with flowers: they seem
To murmur enchanted hymns that no soul could resist.

The sun will listen as all shadows creep
With whispers of fields that are lost in the past.
And sigh all the winds that keep vigil and weep,
For the silence shall hold what the sweet storms amassed.
