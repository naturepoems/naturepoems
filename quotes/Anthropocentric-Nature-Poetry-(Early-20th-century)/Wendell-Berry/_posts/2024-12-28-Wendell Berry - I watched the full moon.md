I watched the full moon rise
   like a blessing over the fields,
   turning the night to silver
   where bare branches stretch
   toward a sky alive with stars.

   The owl calls from afar,
   wings tracing secrets
   in the cool autumn air,
   and I learn the language of night,
   the teachings of a world
   that speaks in the stillness.

   I am no longer separate,
   but a part of this vastness,
   an honored witness
   to the beauty that endures,
   learning every day to love
   this wild, fierce tranquility.


- Wendell Berry
