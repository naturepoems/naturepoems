The poetry of nature is a seamless veil,
   A garden where each petal tells a tale,
From dainty buds to towering trees,
In every breeze, thereâ€™s music released.
The amber glow of the setting sun,
A sweet reminder of battles won,
With skies adorned in violet hue,
Such sights remind me of love so true.

Oh fleeting moments that the seasons bring,
In whispering winds, the joy's a sting,
The fragrant bliss of blossoms bright,
A tapestry woven from day to night.

In every shadow, a story lingers,
In each bright note, a song it sings,
Nature entwined in heartfelt gleam,
Inviting each soul to share a dream.

- John Keats
