Beneath the verdant woodland shade,  
Where flowers brightly bloom,  
I wander in the fragrant glade,  
Dissolving care and gloom.  

The fluttering wings of summer come,  
To tarry for a while.  
The songs of birds, though far from home,  
Sing sweet in nature’s style.  

Oh, let me lose myself in peace,  
Where every beauty stirs;  
In nature’s hand my burdens cease,  
In gentle memory purrs.

- Joyce Kilmer
