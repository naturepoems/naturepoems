The Pool

   I
   O take me to your pool,
   O comfort me where your shadows
   lie soft across the waves.

   II
   Will you not use your hand,
   Will you not bring your token?
   Will you not throw a grain,
   a pebble on the water?

   III
   O it is dark here,
   O we are quiet now, and in the pool
   we are lost, in the shadow of reeds,
   we lie waiting, waiting.
   IV
   The water is green,          
   blow forth a lily,       
   a water-lily blown about the pool, 
   dropped and rounded  
   upon the blue folds of the sky.
