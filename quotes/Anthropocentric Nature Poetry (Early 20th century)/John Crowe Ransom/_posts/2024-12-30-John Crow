To a Seed
   
  Lowly against drizzling grey throughout,  
  I hold you sacred, a promise of greeting,
  Deep among the thickening glades you peek out,
  Planted on a mobilized tongue of kiss mild.

  With soil embracing each split fringe of dreams,
  You traverse through earthâ€™s blind tunnels of first
  Thrust, crystalline bound, each lighter sensation,
  Seeds bless the ambrosia of life first inverse.

  Someday sweet light shall crown your dark cover,
  For I collect the snippets, remnant graces,
  Let the world rush beyond, in stepped fervor,
  Embrace life, embrace home from each yearning cranny.

- John Crowe Ransom
