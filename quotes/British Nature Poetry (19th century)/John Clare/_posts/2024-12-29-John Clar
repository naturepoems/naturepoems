Glistening dewdrops adorn the morn,  
    Like jewels scattered across the green;  
Each petal opening, a new life born,  
    In every shape and hue, serene.  
The chorus of nature fills the air,  
    As birds unite with song so clear;  
In the gentle breeze, the love we share,  
    A wondrous dance of life appears.

- John Clare
