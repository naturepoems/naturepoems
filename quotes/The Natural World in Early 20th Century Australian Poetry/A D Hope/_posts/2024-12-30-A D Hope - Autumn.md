Autumn
The air is ripe with bitter sweet,  
As leaves, like memories, twist and turn,  
In gentle breezes, they meet,  
And whisper secrets autumn yearns.

Rich golds spill out from tender trees,  
As twilight falls, and shadows play,  
On ground where eagles once flew free,  
Now echoes fade, as night takes day.

The world turns soft in eveningâ€™s sigh,  
Where twilight paints the landscape still,  
And heartbeats slow, as time slips by,  
In rustling leaves, the fading thrill.
