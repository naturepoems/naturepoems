Anemones

In the wave and whirl,
Ruffled petals sway,  
Drained of dew,
They sprawl from the earth  
Over wine-blown gardens,
Where throngs quaint and flock away,
In a pulse of green blooming flies.

At the base of low stones,
Engorged with earth and shells,
As I sit, completely shrouded,
My fingers feel them cold,  
With little bits held beneath,
Like souls adorned,
Transported in cushioned breath,
Drained from the heart of bloom.
