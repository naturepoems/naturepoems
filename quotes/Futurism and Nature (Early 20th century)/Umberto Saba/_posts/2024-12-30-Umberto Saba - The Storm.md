A storm brews on the horizon,
Thunder rumbles like a heartbeat bold,
The sky darkens, shadows dance,
As raindrops tumble, a symphony untold.

Each droplet kisses the thirsty ground,
Awakening the scent of earth’s delight,
And in the chaos of nature’s fury,
Lies the raw beauty of life’s true fight.

After the tempest, the world reborn,
A shimmer of hope in each radiant bloom,
Nature teaches in her tumultuous way,
That from destruction, we rise from gloom.

- Umberto Saba
