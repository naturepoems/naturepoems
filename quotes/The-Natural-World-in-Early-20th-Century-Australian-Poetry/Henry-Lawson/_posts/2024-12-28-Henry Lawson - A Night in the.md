A Night in the Bush
When the stars crowd together and the moonbeams unfold,
The campfire awakens a story long told.
The shadows ride high ‘neath the night’s velvet sky,
As the owl hoots softly, and the winds gently sigh.
Amongst the tall trees, stands my tent, my home,
Where I dream of the valleys and mountains to roam.
Oh night in the bush, with the world wrapped in peace,
Cradle my heart, let the burdens all cease.

- Henry Lawson
