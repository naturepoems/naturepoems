The Singing Meadow

The winds carry me  
through golden horizons,  
those open from impending sands.  

Cicadas fill the air  
in uttering spells,  
inviting butterflies,  
welcoming the sun.  

Amidst the flowering glades,  
birds become a matter  
of elegance and dance;  
emotions rich as roots  
bring forth all around.  

In the depths so deep,  
I find solace within â€”  
a meadow singing bright,  
a chorus of the stars.

- Gabriela Mistral
