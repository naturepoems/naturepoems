Autumn Leaves

In golden hues the boughs do bend,
Where once the greens did proudly sway;
Now crisp and brittle, nature’s blend
Of fleeting time on this fine day.

They dance like whispers through the air,
A soft farewell to the warm glow;
Each wisp a tale of joys laid bare,
A story in their gentle flow.

And 'neath the tree, as shadows play,
A carpet formed of rustling gold;
Reminds me of the fleeting day,
In nature’s dance, the truth unfolds.

- Helen M B M Maud
