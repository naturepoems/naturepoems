The Sea

The sea laps up joy  
  Like its shear coat,  
  It ever cries out bright  
 
And loses itself from  
  wet to cold rocks,  
  It twinkles and saunters high,  
 
Until the light,  
  breaking day into the night,  
Sings along the charted way;  
  May the light remain and play,  
 
And voices ripple their sweet  
  Echos to the air —  
  Sashaying as it flows thin,  
 
Taking the long way home,  
  The sea, it knows me well.  

—Lola Ridge
