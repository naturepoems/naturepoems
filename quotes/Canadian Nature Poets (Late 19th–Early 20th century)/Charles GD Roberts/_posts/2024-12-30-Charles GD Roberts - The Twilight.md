The Twilight

When twilight draws her dusky veil,  
  O'er hills and vale and tree,  
And night unfolds her silken sail  
  To drift across the sea,  
I breathe the beauty of the hour,  
  As darkness holds her sway,  
And nature's charm, like a fragrant flower,  
  Unfolds the close of day.

The stars come forth to light the night,  
  With eyes of silver glow,  
While the moon adorns a sphere of white,  
  To watch the world below.  
The dreams of men take flight anew,  
  In the dusk's soft, silent glee,  
And life is blessed with each twilight hue—  
  In the land of mystery.

So let me rest in this realm of peace,  
  And drink the twilight air,  
For every whisper brings me ease,  
  A solace pure and rare;  
In praises raised to nature's charms,  
  I find my spirit's plea,  
To linger here with open arms,  
  And let sweet love be free.

- Charles GD Roberts
