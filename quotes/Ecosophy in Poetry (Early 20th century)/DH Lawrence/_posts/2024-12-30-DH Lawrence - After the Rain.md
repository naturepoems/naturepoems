After the Rain

All being gathers now,  
The petals of all weight,  
Where the after-energy,  
Sends brightening tendrils down,  
The air flares in tender  
Droplets sparkling on the grass.

There’s a rapturous thrill,  
As if a lover’s touch ignites,  
Mingling with the dew,  
Embarking on this heart’s flight,  
As nature sighs with release.

A stillness creeps,  
From the gentle essence,  
Cleansing of the storm;  
And the verdure green  
Is given back its true life.

— D.H. Lawrence
