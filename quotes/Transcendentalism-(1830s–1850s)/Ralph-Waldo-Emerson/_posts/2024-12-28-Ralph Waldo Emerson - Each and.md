Each and All

   Little thinks, in the world of men,
   Of the rogue and multitudes so full,
   That all creatures play an intermixed role;
   Kind in grand design, none the less in care,
   And earth, a boundless whole.

   I marvel those that love the skies,
   And sometimes break their chains,
   Finding fine beauty in each garden prize,
   And, bound in earnest, know life's pains.

                                               —Ralph Waldo Emerson
