Found objects crowd
   the busy little stream,
   a mason bee, a shaggy
   Hen, suddenly still.
   Nature’s intricacies
   beckon—if we reach,
   wheels softly turning,
   we can glimpse the fading
   world at the Meeting of the Waters; 
   the deep, broader passage
   offers its light.
   Who could resist this exchange:
   sunshine for shadow,
   freshness for depth?

- Marianne Moore
