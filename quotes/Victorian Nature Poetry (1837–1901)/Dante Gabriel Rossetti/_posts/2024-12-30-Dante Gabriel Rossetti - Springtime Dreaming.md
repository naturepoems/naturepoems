In the springtime when the willows weep, 
Longing in hues of golden grace;  
Whispers of beauty flow in and out,  
Where fairies leave their trace.

Let me tread on dreams anew, 
Through corals of drenching light;  
For every heart must find its way—  
In a flutter, pure delight.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
