above fields both green and worn, 
the echo of wind lifting, 
yet only leaves backpack the trails. 
Such tranquil moments surround 
a world of living shapes, marking their splendor."

An understatement: a low cloud hovers 
above fields both green and worn, 
the echo of wind lifting, 
yet only leaves backpack the trails. 
Such tranquil moments surround 
a world of living shapes, marking their splendor.

- Marianne Moore
