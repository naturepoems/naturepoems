In the Garden  
A portion of the Day,  
Is spent with Birds and Bees,  
Who often gather for their Delights  
Under the rose trees.  

The Flower's motto is to bloom  
In summer's gentle thrall;  
And with a smile beneath the frost  
To pine before the fall.  

Like Flora make us blossom  
Amid the sun and rain;  
And all the world will watch with love  
The Seasons turn again.  
—Emily Dickinson
