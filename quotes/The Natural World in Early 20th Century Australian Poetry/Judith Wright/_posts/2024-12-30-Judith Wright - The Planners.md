The Planners

And the men come with their calculations,
Mapping the land and the earthâ€™s breath,
Forgetting the love that lies deeper
Than the cold statistics they weave.

But the flow of rivers
And the heartbeat of the hills,
Tell a different tale:
One of love, loss, and roots held tight.


- Judith Wright
