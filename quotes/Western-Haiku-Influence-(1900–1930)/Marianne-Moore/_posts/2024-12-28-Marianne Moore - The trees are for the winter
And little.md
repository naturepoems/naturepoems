And little"

author: Marianne Moore
quote: "The trees are for the winter
And little cages
Of birds, for the stillness
Of the chill air. Cold leaps,
And the warm ground, winning,
For the will, holds the gritting
Of crickets at last."

The trees are for the winter
And little cages
Of birds, for the stillness
Of the chill air. Cold leaps,
And the warm ground, winning,
For the will, holds the gritting
Of crickets at last.

- Marianne Moore
