Goodbye

There’s a whisper through the leaves and the sigh
A memory of the morning time we were bound,
The light of the day breaks upon freedom's cry;
And I turn away from the moments that passed around.

For the echoes of laughter shall fade away,
In the night and the dream shall linger low,
Into the shadows beneath the twilight, sway;
Yet, the love will still hold when I long to go.

So farewell, dear land of unfolding skies,
As the dust and dew shall sprinkle my fate,
In the gentle whispers where the heart flies,
A goodbye that will outlast the burden of late.

Come feast your heart beneath the endless stars –
For sing I shall remain where the world was light,
In the dreams of laughter and singing hours,
For love shall hold forever-come away tonight!

- Banjo Paterson
