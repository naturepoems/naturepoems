The best part of the life of man
Is a hidden life—this to be,—
Remains unknown, as ship, and shore,
Far away from any key.

Let deep woods hide, for shall they spare
The passions flaming 'neath the skin,
To give us muse, and worlds to share,
Uncovering where we once have been.

O qui vive! The deep wood sings,
Arise and lift the healing veil!
For nature holds her treasured things,
And what is lost, yet fills the pale.

- William Wordsworth
