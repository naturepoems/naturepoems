Summer

Ode to summer, yes,  
Queen of the year!  
When all is green and gold,  
When backroads are a treasure,  
When human headed to repose.  
Temporary rest,  
Yet the nearness of low hues.  

Thus, where flowers swirl  
In fragrant threads as languages speak,  
In thy bosom, winter stays  
For hollow green.  
- Ralph Waldo Emerson
