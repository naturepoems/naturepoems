After the Rain

After the rain, the world gleams bright,
Each drop a gem upon the leaves—
Where the earth breathes fresh and alive,
And the sky, a canvas of reunion, recalls
The beauty of transient moments;
I walk in reverence along the path,
Knowing that every storm, every sigh,
Brings forth a renaissance of dreams.
