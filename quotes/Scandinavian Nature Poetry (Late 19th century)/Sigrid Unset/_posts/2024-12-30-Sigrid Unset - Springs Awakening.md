The springtime blooms, a vibrant cheer,
As life returns with each new year.
In natureâ€™s wonder, we draw near,
With open hearts and spirits clear.

The swaying grass, the chirping birds,
A chorus sweet without the words.
In every note, the heart absorbs,
In nature's love, our joy implores.

- Sigrid Unset
