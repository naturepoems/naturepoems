The Negro Speaks of Rivers

I've known rivers:
Ancient, dusky rivers.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

Egyptian Nile,
The Euphrates,
The Congo,
And the Mississippi.

When warm waters
Cooled over my head,
When I bathed in the waters,
I felt the spirits of the rivers.

I have seen its muddy bosom
Turn golden in the sunset.
I have watched its waters
Carry stories of the past.

And my soul has grown deep like the rivers.

- Langston Hughes
