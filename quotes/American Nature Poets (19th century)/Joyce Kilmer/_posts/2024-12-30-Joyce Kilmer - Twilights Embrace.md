When twilight cloaks the world in peace,
And stars emerge where day has fled,
The hush of night brings sweet release,
As nature cradles all to bed.

With moonlit paths and silver beams,
The soul takes flight on whispered dreams;
Through every leaf and gentle stream,
I find fulfillment, joy supreme.

- Joyce Kilmer
