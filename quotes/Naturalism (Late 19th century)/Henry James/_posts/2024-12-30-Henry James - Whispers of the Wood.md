Through the forest, in hushed delight,
Sunbeams dance, a playful light.
Leaves shimmer softly, a gentle sway,
Nature's ballets at the end of day.

Here stand the oaks, wise and grand,
Roots entwined in the soft, dark sand.
In their shade, with the cool morning air,
The world seems still, and free from care.


- Henry James
