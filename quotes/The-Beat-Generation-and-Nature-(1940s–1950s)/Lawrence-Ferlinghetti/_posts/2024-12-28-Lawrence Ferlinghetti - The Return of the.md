The Return of the Ship
The ship that sails
is the ship that sinks
and the storm inside
is always howling.

And yet the moon
still holds the day, still
holds the night
in a quiet grace,
between the wakefulness
of clouds and the peace beneath,

as the tide rolls in,
naturally.
The light, the sea,
our souls wander freely,
like the vastness above.


- Lawrence Ferlinghetti
