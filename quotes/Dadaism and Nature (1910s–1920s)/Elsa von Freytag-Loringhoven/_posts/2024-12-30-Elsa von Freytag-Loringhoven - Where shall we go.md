Where shall we go,
   hunting for autumn’s aftermath?
   Terracotta wind pushes
   against the brittle leaves,
   un-rooted — yet intact;
   in photogenic whispers,
   unmatched silences grow,
   with blooms waiting
   on instinct’s edge,
   while lizards flee
   from waters divine.
   Demand a theft of color!

- Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven
