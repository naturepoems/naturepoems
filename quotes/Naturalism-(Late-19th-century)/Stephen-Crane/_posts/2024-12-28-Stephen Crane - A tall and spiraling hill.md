A tall and spiraling hill, 
With its green leaves, and tall trees,
Stands thereâ€”not in a hurry, 
It waits, it sees.

A stone weighs heavy, yet I find, 
That all the rocks in paradise,
Are in every leaf, and in every mind. 

The birds sing for peace, 
You can hear the echoes; 
The earth speaks a thousand words, 
And the warmth of the sun never forgets.

- Stephen Crane
