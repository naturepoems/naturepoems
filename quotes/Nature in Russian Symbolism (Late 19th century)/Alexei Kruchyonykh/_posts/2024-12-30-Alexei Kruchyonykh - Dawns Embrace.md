Dawn’s Embrace
As dawn breaks softly, kissed by the sun,
Nature awakens, a new day begun.
The sky blushes pink, orange hues ignite,
In this tender moment, everything feels right.

Birds sing their praises, a glorious sound,
In the arms of the morning, hope can be found.
With each ray that tumbles through the trees,
I revel in nature’s vast symphonies.

- Alexei Kruchyonykh
