The Effect

When spring touches the land,  
The stir is felt in every hand.  
A vibrant pulse ignites the clay,  
And blooms the world in sweet bouquet.  

Each flower born out of yearning light,  
Brush strokes refining day and night.  
For all that glimmers in the shade,  
Will share the fate where hopes are laid.  

Embrace the bruise of life’s soft stroke,  
And take a breath from fate’s own yoke.  
With every beat, new dreams reside  
When spirit swells with joy and pride.

- Edward Thomas
