Summer's Embrace

When summer sun kisses the land,
With golden rays that dance and play,
Each petal, leaf, and grain of sand,
Bathe in the warmth of brightening day.

The bees hum low, a melody,
As birds rejoice in airy flight,
In every nook, a symphony,
Of life adorned in pure delight.

Beneath the shade of orchard trees,
In fragrant fields, we find our bliss,
The gentle sway of nature's breeze,
A soft reminder—here’s our kiss.

- Clara Wadel
