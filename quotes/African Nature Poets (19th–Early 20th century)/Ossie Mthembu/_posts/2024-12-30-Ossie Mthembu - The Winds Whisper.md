The Wind's Whisper

In the stillness of the night,
The wind whispers secrets,
Carrying tales of the ancients,
Through the leaves of the old baobab.

Over hills and valleys,
It dances with the grass,
Unraveling the stories,
Of souls who’ve crossed the vast.

Listen closely, dear one,
For nature speaks in sighs,
And in every rustle,
There’s magic that never dies.

- Ossie Mthembu
