Awakening

As dawn unfurls its golden wings,
the world whispers anew,
each leaf uncurling,
breathes in the fragrance of hope.

Birds in the branches
burst forth in jubilant song,
a celebration of lifeâ€™s return,
reminding us of the delicate balance
woven into every moment.

Sunbeams penetrate the mist,
dancing with the dew,
a symphony of light spills
onto the canvas of earth,
a tender stirring.

In this awakening,
we find our own rebirth,
a chance to connect,
to the pulse beneath the surface,
a promise found
in the whispers of the wind.
