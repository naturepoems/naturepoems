The Grass  
   
Upon the green, a carpet laid,  
In sunlight’s soft enfolding shade,  
A world of life that springs anew,  
In every blade, a tale rings true.  
  
With whispers light as breezes pass,  
It dances in the golden glass,  
In summer’s air, where children play,  
A sanctuary, nature’s sway.  
  
There lies the essence pure and bright,  
Of verdant fields, of beauty’s light,  
In every tuft, a love expressed,  
The grass, a tender, verdant vest.

- Herman Melville
