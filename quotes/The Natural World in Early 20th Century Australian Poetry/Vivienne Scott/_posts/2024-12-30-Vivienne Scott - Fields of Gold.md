Amidst the rush of wildflowers bloom,  
In every petal, life finds room,  
Colors burst with joyous cheer,  
An artful palette, crystal clear.

As breezes weave through fields of gold,  
They carry tales of ages told,  
With each soft touch, nature reveals,  
The strength of life, the heart that heals.
