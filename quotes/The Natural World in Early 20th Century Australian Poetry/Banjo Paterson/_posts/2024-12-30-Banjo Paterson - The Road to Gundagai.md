The Road to Gundagai

Oh, I've been thinking about my childhood days,
In the dust and sun, with laughter ablaze,
When we rode to Gundagai along the trail,
On the road to Gundagai, I think, I will hail.

With the sun-drenched plains and the wild-stepping crows,
The laughing laughter of chocolate-sweet rhymes flows.
As we wove our hearts among the trees,
At night we’d share tales beneath the stars' glees.

For the road to Gundagai sings a song of our hearts,
Where freedom glistens in light as the night departs,
And the swaying grasses blow thin and shy
On the road of dreams as days drift by.

So I’ll take a friend, and we’ll ride along,
For in life and love, we are ever strong;
And the path where we travel shall shine bright,
On the road to Gundagai, under starlight!


- Banjo Paterson
