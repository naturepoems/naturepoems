God's World

O world, I cannot hold thee close enough!
Thy winds, thy wide grey skies!
Thy mists that roll and rise!
Thy woods, this autumn day, that ache and sigh!

The great, soft wind that stirs the trees,
And brings the weather-meek release,
Is transitory and worth all my grief.
Yet I cannot hold thee close enough, nor tell
The joy I reap from earth and heaven's light.
