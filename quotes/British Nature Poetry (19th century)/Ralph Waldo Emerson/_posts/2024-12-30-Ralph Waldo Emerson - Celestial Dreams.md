The stars above, they twinkle bright,
Guiding the lost through the night;
In the vastness of the darkened skies,
Eternity speaks through the cosmic rise.

Dreamers gaze and wonder why,
The universe, a lullaby;
For in the heavens, truth be told,
Lies a boundless story to unfold.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
