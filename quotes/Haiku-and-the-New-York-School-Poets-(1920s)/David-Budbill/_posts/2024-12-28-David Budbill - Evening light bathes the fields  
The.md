The wind weaves tales through tall grasses,  
Fireflies dance like thoughts,  
Fleeting and bright against the dusk,  
Nature whispers her secrets."

Evening light bathes the fields,  
The wind weaves tales through tall grasses,  
Fireflies dance like thoughts,  
Fleeting and bright against the dusk,  
Nature whispers her secrets.
