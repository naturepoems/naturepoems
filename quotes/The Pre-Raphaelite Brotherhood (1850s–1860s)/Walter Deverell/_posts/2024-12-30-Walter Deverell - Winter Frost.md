WINTER FROST

The winter frost, a quilt of diamonds bright,  
Upon each tree, each branch, a sparkling crown;  
The breath of ice does cloak the world in white,  
An elegant shroud of silence pressed down.  
In this frozen kingdom, life seems to drown,  
Yet deep within, the pulse of spring does lay,  
Awaiting moments where blossoms break ground,  
To thaw the winter’s chill, and bring the day.


- Walter Deverell
