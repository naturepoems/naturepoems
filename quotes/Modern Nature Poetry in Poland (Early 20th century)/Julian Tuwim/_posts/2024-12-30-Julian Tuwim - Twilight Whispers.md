In the twilight, shadows grow,
Looming long against the light,
The stars spark one by one,
In the waltz of the coming night.

The earth sings a lullaby,
Murmurs softly to the day,
Cuddled in natureâ€™s arms, we close
Our eyes to drift away.

In dreams, we walk through meadows,
Where flowers bloom and laughter flows,
A dance of spirit, pure and free,
In the heart of nature's throes.

- Julian Tuwim
