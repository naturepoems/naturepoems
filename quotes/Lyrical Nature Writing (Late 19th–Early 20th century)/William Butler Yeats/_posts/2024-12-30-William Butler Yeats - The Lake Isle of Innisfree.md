The Lake Isle of Innisfree
I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made:
Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.

And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,
Dropping from the veils of the morning
To where the cricket sings;
There mid the water-lilies,
I will tread a soft path, and be alone with nature,
And peace will come to me,

I shall rise and go now, for I can feel the sea,
Derivatively calling out to me,
And I see the clear morning;
So I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree.

- William Butler Yeats
