Mind Breaths

When I walk among the trees,
        my mind breathes in,
            the scent of pine,
How I feel the air, thick and warm,
   carrying heavy whispers of the spirit,
I think of blooms and birds,
    the richness of the world,

Nature holds my heart,
    encircles my soul,
        I feel it step by step,
Through paths untraveled
down into the depths of the wild.
