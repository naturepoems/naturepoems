Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Early Childhood
There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
The earth, and every common sight, to me
Did seem Apparell'd in celestial light,
The glory and the freshness of a dream.

It is not now as it hath been of yore;â€”
Turn wheresoe'er I may,
By night or day,
The things which I have seen I now can see no more.

The rainbow comes and goes,
And lovely is the Rose,
The moon doth with delight
Look round her when the heavens are bare,
Waters on a starry night
Are beautiful and fair;

But now, I find, oft, as I roam,
If I must sometimes be sad, I find,
The echoes strike the boughs,
And the dark leaves fall,
And yet make of it all a home.

- William Wordsworth
