As shadows fall on the winding path,
The scent of jasmine fills the air;
Moonlight bathes the world in silver,
A soft glow beyond compare.

The night is alive with whispers,
A symphony of crickets’ song;
Each heartbeat resonates with nature,
In this moment, where we belong.

Let the night wrap you in its cloak,
Let the world fade into dreams;
For in the arms of the quiet woods,
Life’s magic is all that it seems.

- Arthur Rimbaud
