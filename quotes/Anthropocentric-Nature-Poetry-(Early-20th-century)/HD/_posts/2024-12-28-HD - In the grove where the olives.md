In the grove where the olives grow,
young leaves are gilded,
clinging tenaciously to hope.

Branches twist and curl,
a dance of resilience,
yearning for the winds to speak.

The sun filters down,
through leaves, a mosaic,
a celebration of light and shadow.

Life thrives here,
in the simplicity of being,
the world spins on its axis,
a quiet affirmation of existence.
