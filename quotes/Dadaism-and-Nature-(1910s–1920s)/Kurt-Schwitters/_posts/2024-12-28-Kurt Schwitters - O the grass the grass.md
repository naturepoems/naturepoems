O, the grass, the grass  
murmurs poems of green  
how the wind traverses  
a field of thoughts,  
whispers of earth,  
light in the shadow,  
a dance of leaves—  
or so it seems!  

The trees,  
like old friends,  
stand with arms raised,  
basking in sunlit memory,  
while birds comment,  
dropping notes of music,  
in the cicadas’ hum—  
a chorus of longing.

- Kurt Schwitters
