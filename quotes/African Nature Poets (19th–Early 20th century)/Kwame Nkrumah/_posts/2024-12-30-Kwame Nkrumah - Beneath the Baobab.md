Beneath the Baobab
Ancient baobab, wise and tall,
Keeper of secrets, witnessing all.
Your roots spread deep, your branches wide,
A shelter for dreams, where the spirits abide.

Under your shade, the children play,
Echoes of laughter chase worries away.
With wisdom you share, in silence profound,
In you, the true essence of life is found.

- Kwame Nkrumah
