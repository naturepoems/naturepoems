A Dream

    The sky is blue, the air is light,
    A breeze comes dancing through;
    The world is glad, all hearts are bright,
    And I am glad with you.

    We wander 'neath the ancient trees,
    By streams that softly flow;
    With every step the heart finds ease,
    In nature's sweet bestow.

    So let us dream, O heart of mine,
    And love in nature's arms,
    For there, my dear, with thee divine,
    We linger in her charms.

- George Meredith
