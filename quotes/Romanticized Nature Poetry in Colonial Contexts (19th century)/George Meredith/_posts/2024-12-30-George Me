The Evening Star

High up in the cradle of twilight's embrace,
The Evening Star glimmers, a beacon of grace.
With velvety darkness enfolding the sight,
It anchors my dreams in the soft of the night.

A sentinel shining in deep azure skies,
A guide through the shadows, a compass that lies.
It beckons the wanderers, the hearts that have roamed,
To find peace in stillness, in the warmth of the home.

O Star of the evening, so brilliant and bright,
Your glow is a promise that banishes fright.
In the hush of the cosmos, my spirit shall soar,
To the rhythm of nature, forever adored. 

â€”George Meredith
