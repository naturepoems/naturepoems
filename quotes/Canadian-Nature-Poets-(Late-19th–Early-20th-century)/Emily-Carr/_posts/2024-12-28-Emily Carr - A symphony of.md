A symphony of nature,
The ocean’s deep breath,
Caressing the shoreline,
And beckoning death
Of the day gone before,
In the rich, salty mist,
The rhythm of waves,
In my heart’s tender fist.

Oh, land of the emerald,
With shores kissed by sun,
Forever I wander,
With you, I am one.
For in every wild sea,
In the forests I roam,
I’m swept by the currents
That call me to come home.

- Emily Carr
