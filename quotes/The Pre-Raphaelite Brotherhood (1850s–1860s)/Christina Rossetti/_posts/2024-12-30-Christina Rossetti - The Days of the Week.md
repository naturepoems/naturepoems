The daisies blow and hedges flower,
And the fliers flit, and the waters fall,
And the wind is soft and sweet as hour.
There is life and hope, and over all,  
Is love, that sweet and faintest bell,
That like the whisper of a pearl.

Soft winds from green pastures play,
Where the woodlands sway and breast the pine,
And the golden ore, of the day,
Is full of beauty and the Divine.

So in this warm, wide valley, blooms
All joys. Sweet laid is the summer day,
Where the spirit in perfect music, comes
And look, I see that it does not decay.

- Christina Rossetti
