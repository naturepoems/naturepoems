The Cretaceous**

The land remembersâ€¦
The deep yielding to the pull of water,
The break of wave along rock and shore
And the rhythm of her heart, the pace of ages.

In the bones of the earth,
Destruction becomes new life,
And the voice of rocks and stone,
Raise questions of time and place,
Where the sky touches the salt of the sea.


- Judith Wright
