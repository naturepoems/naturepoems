Skyward

Through tangled branches, I gaze,
a canvas of azure spilled out,
with clouds daubed in creamy white,
a world that shifts with the light.

A breeze dances through leaves,
carrying whispers of freedom,
while shadows play on the ground,
those small symphonies seldom heard.

In this expanse, I lose myself,
becoming one with the vast,
as the sun kisses the horizon,
ending day with a fiery farewell.


- María Pizarro
