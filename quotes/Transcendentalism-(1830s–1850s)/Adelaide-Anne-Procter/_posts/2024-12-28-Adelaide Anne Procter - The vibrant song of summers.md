The vibrant song of summer's morn,
   Awakens every fragrant flower;
The sunbeams dance where leaves are borne,
   In joyous bliss, in joyous hour.

The rustle of the golden grain,
   The laughter of the playful throng,
I feel my spirit rise again,
   In Nature's realm, where I belong.

- Adelaide Anne Procter
