Cradle Song
Sweet dreams, form a shade
O'er my darling's head!
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams
By happy, silent, glades!

Here, in cool and shady wood,
O'er my breast, its leaves have strewed;

And for flowers, to cover me,
All the winds, of all the trees
Let them storm and hurry by!

My child, my love, my rest,
Jesus, the lamb, my breast.

- William Blake
