Going Green
In spring, when the earth wakes,  
I walk through the wood of the tall oaks,  
where sunlight dapples the ground,  
a mosaic of new life,  
where silence sings a fresher tune.

The greens are electric,  
bursting forth like laughter,  
while the wildflowers nod their heads,  
proud guardians of the soil,  
a rich tapestry woven with joy.  

Here, amidst whispers of leaves,  
yellow and lavender,  
a painting of scents fills my lungs,  
reminding me of lifeâ€™s intricate threads  
that bind us to this wild earth.

- Ruth Padel
