The trees stand,
Arm in arm,
In the forest,
Like old friends,
Sharing whispers,
Of memories,
And sunlight, filtered through,
In golden patches.

Moss grows soft at their feet,
Big mushrooms all around them,
In the dappled light,
A quiet kingdom,
Where time seems to fold,
Into a tapestry of green.

- Amy Lowell
