The forest deep, a sacred hall,
Where ancient trees stand tall and proud,
Their roots entwined in nature's thrall,
Beneath a verdant, leafy shroud.

Soft sounds of rustling leaves unfold,
A tapestry of life and grace,
In every branch, a story told,
In every shadow, a tranquil space.


- William H Prescott
