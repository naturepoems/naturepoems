The dawn breaks soft and tender,
Painting skies with dreams anew,
As the world awakens gently,
In the light's warm, golden hue.

The birds sing to the morning,
In a chorus, fresh and bright,
And the flowers yawn in sunshine,
In a symphony of light.

Every leaf, a whispered promise,
Every brook, a joyful sound,
Nature holds a canvas open,
Where beauty knows no bound.

In this moment, I discover,
Life begins with every ray,
In the dance of dawnâ€™s embrace,
Where tomorrow greets today.
