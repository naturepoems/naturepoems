The Lizard
On the rock, hot to the touch,  
In the cool of the morning mist,  
The lizard patiently waits,  
Uncertain but sure,  
Its stillness speaks with wisdom.

Back to the sun  
It glances, writhing  
Mysteriously, coiled  
In the grasp of day,  
Drifting from shadow  
Into morning wonder.

- Marianne Moore
