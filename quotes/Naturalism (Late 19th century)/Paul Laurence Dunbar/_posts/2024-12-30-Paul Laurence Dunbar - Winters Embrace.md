In winter's grasp, the world sleeps deep,  
Where silence holds the earth in keep.  
The snowflakes fall, a gentle shroud,  
While dreams are wrapped in nature's proud.  

Yet beneath the frost, the seeds do lie,  
Awaiting warmth and time to fly.  
For every winter must give way,  
To spring's bright bloom, a new array.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
