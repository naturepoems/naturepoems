In the Midst of Silence

I tread softly,
On a carpet of moss,
Hushed by nature’s breath,
Among the whispering trees.
The stillness holds me close,
In the embrace of shadows,
Where every sound unspoken,
Is a heartbeat of the earth.

The air, thick with stories,
Of ages long gone,
Lingers sweetly, unyielding,
Amid the strands of silence,
Where I lay my fears to rest,
And hear the pulse of existence,
The gentle thrum of being.

— Wole Soyinka
