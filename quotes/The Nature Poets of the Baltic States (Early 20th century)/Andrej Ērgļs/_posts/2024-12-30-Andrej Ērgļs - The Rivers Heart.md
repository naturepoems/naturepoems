The river flows like liquid glass,  
In its embrace, the world unfolds,  
Stories etched in every ripple,  
Secrets shared, and dreams retold.

Winding paths through emerald hills,  
With every bend, a new embrace,  
The heart of nature beats in time,  
In motion, holding wisdom's grace.

Where fish dart by and willows sway,  
In love with water’s soft caress,  
Life finds its voice in gentle streams,  
A flowing hymn of wilderness.

- Andrej Ērgļs
