Nature's Grace
Behold how rich the evening sky,
Hangs low upon the purple hill.
The nightingale is heard so nigh,
The theatre of hope to fill.

O hast thou seen, O hast thou heard,
The flowers that bloom at dusk's decay? 
And when the lark and nightingale
Are soft to greet the sun-dried day?  

And in those dreams of beauty rare,
How deep and wide the lost refrain, 
Let all who wander seek again,
Sweet Nature’s grace again in vain.

- Christina Rossetti
