The Sixth Book of Paradise Lost  

No depth of night or length of day can hide,  
   The beating heart of nature’s finest charms,  
The mountains tall, the valleys’ gentle glide,  
   And twilight whispers filling earth with balms.  
Thus woven threads of life weave weightless light,  
   As joy doth glimmer through the trees in flight.

- John Milton
