Beneath the canopy of the sky,
the vastness is humbling,
yet in its embrace,
we find solace,
a reminder of our smallness,
a part of something greater.

Stars flicker like fireflies,
dancing across the void,
a chorus of potential,
a symphony of hope
that reverberates within us,
 urging us to reach beyond.

In every sunset, there’s closure,
and in every dawn, a rebirth,
a cycle that breathes life
into the mundane,
a testament to the resilience
of the human spirit.

- Stanisław Grochowiak
