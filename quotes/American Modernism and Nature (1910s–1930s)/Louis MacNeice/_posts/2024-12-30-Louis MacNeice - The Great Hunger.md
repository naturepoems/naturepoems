The Great Hunger  

Like children dreaming of bounty,  
The stones, the dirt, even the dark leaves,  
Have clutched their roots,  
And the flowers exhale, ready to bloom  
In the complete acceptance of what  
Is a kind, beautiful rebirth.  

One would breathe wide in fields,  
Gorging upon the stars with the rain  
That spills like honey.  
So easy the light breaks,  
When the air is checked by your breathing  
And in the breathographic soft sighs,  
You will ponder flowers all around  
Happening.  

Here is where the hunger sinks deep,  
A rhythm that spreads from blades of grass,  
Where they whisper softly  
To our awkward wandering.  
It swells to make you wonder:  
Is this creation or release?  
To know our being ever  
Turns inside our own reflections.

- Louis MacNeice
