When winter calls
the wind blows colder,
crystals gather,
a blanket of white
on the sleeping world,
a stratagem of time that wraps
the stories of days past
in its icy grip.

Everything rests
waiting to exhale
when spring rolls in,
with its fingers of green,
sprouting visions anew.


- Tadeusz Różewicz
