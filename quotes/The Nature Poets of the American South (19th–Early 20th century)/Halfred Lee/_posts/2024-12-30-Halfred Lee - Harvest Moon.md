Harvest Moon

When autumn whispers soft and low,  
The harvest moon begins to glow.  
Its golden light on fields of grain,  
A bounty gathered, joy and pain.
  
The earth’s embrace, a cycle spun,  
With each end, a new day begun.  
In the stillness, thankful hearts,  
Nature’s gift, as summer departs.


- Halfred Lee
