Climbing the hill at dawn,
I am kissed by the first golden rays;
Nature unfurling in splendor,
Awake in vibrant desire.

The lark rises on the wing,
Each note a tribute to the day,
In the soft embrace of sound,
Filling every corner with joy,
As I lose myself in the symphony of life.

- Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
