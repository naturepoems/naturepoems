The Fall of Leaves

Autumn is come, and the leaves are falling,
And the winds of winter sigh:
The golden boughs have lost their calling,
And the echoes fade and die.

And yet there plant my feet a glory,
That lights up all the plain;
I hold the fruits of Nature's story,
And know not grief nor pain.

- John G Whittier
