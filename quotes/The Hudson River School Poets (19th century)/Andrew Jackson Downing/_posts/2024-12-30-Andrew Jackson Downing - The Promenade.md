The Promenade
In the gardenâ€™s embrace where the roses bloom,
Soft petals unveiled by the kiss of the sun,
A promenade of colors dispels all gloom,
An orchestra of nature, together as one.
The fragrance enchants, the beauty beguiles,
Inviting all hearts to linger a while.

- Andrew Jackson Downing
