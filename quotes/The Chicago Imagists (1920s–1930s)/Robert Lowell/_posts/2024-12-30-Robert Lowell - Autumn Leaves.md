Autumn Leaves
by Robert Lowell

Amid the falling leaves  
that crunch beneath our feet,  
I hear the whispers of change,  
as nature readies herself  
for the cold embrace of winter.

Each leaf falls gracefully,  
dancing in the fading light,  
a tapestry of colors,  
reflections of the sun,  
reminders of what we hold dear.

- Robert Lowell
