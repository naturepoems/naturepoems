The Secret Garden  
In the hidden corners of the twisted vines,  
Where wild blooms flourish and sunlight shines;  
A secret garden, forgotten by time,  
Holds whispers of nature in fragrance and rhyme.
 
The petals unfold like a lover’s sweet sighs,  
As butterflies flit 'neath the vast, open skies;  
Where the heart finds repose from life’s burdens so sore,  
In the charm of the petals forever adored.
 
In the stillness, life pulses with vibrant delight,  
A haven for creatures that dance in the light;  
For this sacred retreat, untouched and now,  
Captures the essence of nature’s great vow.
