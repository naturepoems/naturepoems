When the soft wind of spring does play,
And nature wakes from winter's sway,
The flowers bloom, the streams do sing,
And all the world feels like a king.

The trees are clothed in tender green,
The hills are washed in golden sheen,
And all around, both near and far,
The joy of life shines like a star.

Let children, too, rejoice and play,
No cares to cloud their happy way;
In every leaf, in every sun,
Let them find joy, let them not shun.

For only through the heart's delight,
Can springtime dreams take wondrous flight;  
So let the laughter freely flow,
In every garden's gentle glow.

- Hannah More
