Night

In the evening of life, silence is everywhere.
The little drops fall down, as the leaves dance like dreams,
And the delicate features of nature are wrapped in quiet.
The air is still, and the woods are the home of tranquility;

And I sense the heavens are smiling,
The sun's last rays reflect from the crowing of the sparrow,
And the softness of twilight soothes my weary heart.

Ah! the deep of night!  It is peaceful,
When all is at rest, and laid down to sleep.
What is more beautiful? To lie and to dream,
When moonlight kisses the dews in the garden of dreams?

- William Blake
