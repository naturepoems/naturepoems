Rivers of Life
Flowing freely, the river’s path,
An eternal journey, nature’s wrath.
Reflecting skies, both stormy and clear,
Its voice, a melody I hold dear.

With each ripple, a tale is spun,
Of life and death, of battles won.
The river teaches, it never stays,
A testament to time's endless ways.


- Oda Ndukkor
