The moonlight bathes the silent fields  
In silver shades that softly glide,  
While every blossom gently yields  
Her scent beneath the evening tide;  

The breezes whisper tales of yore,  
The earth, the stars, unite in bliss—  
And on this night, I long for more,  
As Nature’s kiss brings me such peace.

- Michael Drayton
