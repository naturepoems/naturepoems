The Sea-Shell

O to dance upon the sea,
  To catch the stars aglow,
With rhythm of the ocean's sigh,
  In the eveningâ€™s silver show.

There the sea-shells murmur, pinned,
  A trove from the azure deep,
Let the waves speak in tonic blend,
  For memories we keep.

In the echo of the tides,
  Where the sea whispers soft, 
Is the heart string of issues wide,
  Emotions that aloft.

- James Russell Lowell
