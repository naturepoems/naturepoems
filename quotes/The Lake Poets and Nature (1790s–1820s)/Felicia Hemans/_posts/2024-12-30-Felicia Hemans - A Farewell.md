A Farewell
Nature's gifts, a tender parting,  
As the sunset calls the night;  
In the sky, where colors darting,  
Fade into the arms of light.

May I feel as gold descends,  
On the hills where peace descends,  
O Nature, bless this final day,  
As stars and dreams melt all away.

- Felicia Hemans
