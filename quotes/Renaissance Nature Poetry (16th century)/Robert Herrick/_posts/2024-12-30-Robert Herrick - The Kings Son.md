The King's Son

In blossomed glory shall our love partake,
When every spring will answer our delight,
And every garden bloom, shall awaken
Our spirits fraught with nature's light.

Yet in the oversight of measure sweet,
This flower shall bloom in every secret tryst,
And harvest moons shall clasp our beat,
For love's eternal song does twist.

- Robert Herrick
