A gentle breeze now sweeps the flow’r,
And shakes the leaves with life anew;
For every drop and every hour,
The sun’s arms stretch, the earth shines blue.

The daisies spread in thousand rays,
And wildflowers dance in summer’s glow;
I wander through these golden ways,
And feel the heart of nature’s flow.


- William Browne
