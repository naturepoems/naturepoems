The Mountain's Call
High on the peak where the eagles soar,
Nature's grandeur beckons, an ancient lore.
With valleys below, in their emerald grace,
The mountain stands proud, a timeless embrace.

Whispers of winds tell tales of the past,
Of storms that have raged, of shadows that cast.
Yet there is solace in the silence it keeps,
In the depths of its heart where the wild silence sleeps.

- Kwame Nkrumah
