Deep in the heart of the verdant glade,  
Where shadows play and secrets hide,  
The breeze tells tales of long-lost days,  
Of wildflowers and dreams that bide.  
Among the trees, I find my peace,  
As the world fades to a silent hush,  
In nature’s arms, I’m never alone,  
Forever wrapped in her gentle touch.

- Ellen Ballance
