The Twilight

As twilight falls, the world is hushed,
A gentle veil enfolds the day;
In dusky light, the colors flushed,
Are slowly drifting far away.

The stars awaken, one by one,
The moon casts shadows, soft and clear;
In the embrace of night, we run,
To find our dreams, our hearts sincere.

- Marjorie Pickthall
