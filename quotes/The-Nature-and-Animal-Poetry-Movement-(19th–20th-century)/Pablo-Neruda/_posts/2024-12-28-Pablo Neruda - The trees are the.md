The trees are the sealed
lips of the mountain,
they converse in leaf
and whisper in trunk,
to the heavy skies,
in colors of twilight,
they pour their shadows
to cloister my thoughts.
Oh how they flutter and dream
with the winds, with my voice,
as I wander beneath,
endlessly, within,
their arc of ancient song,
where every root sculpts
an earthy memory,
that draws me back
into its blue embrace.
