The wild wood sings to me in silence,
  Each rustling leaf, a gentle tune,
  The whispers of the ancient pine trees,
  The glow of twilight, the watchful moon.
  
  In solitude, the soul finds healing,
  In nature's arms, we feel the grace,
  The earth becomes a sacred canvas,
  Where love and peace forever trace.

- Konstantin Balmont
