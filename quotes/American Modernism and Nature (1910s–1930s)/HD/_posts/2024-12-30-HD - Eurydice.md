Eurydice

I
          “lost to the deeps,”
     to the sea
     that thunders and roars,
like an unshed tear,
    I press against the waves:
     “why should you drown me,
     so cruelly,
desire is strange,
     when one is lost in the mist,
     when they sit alone,
     folded, sunk
     in your noontide crown.”
       
   II
how to grow
    to rediscover those shores,
or am I just a flower,
victoriously blooming
   in your desire’s shifting sands—
     god and river, my lover,
     where have you gone?”
   —H.D.
