The Wild Flower
A flower wild, with modest grace,
In beauty too, deserves its place,
Each petal soft with color bright,
Dances eager in the light.

It grows where careless children tread,
Yet wears a crown above its head;
In every breeze that sways the land,
Natureâ€™s hand shows love's command.

O gentle bloom, that none can tame,
In quiet woods, you make your claim;
A spirit in the vast and free,
Whispering to me, 'Come see me be.'

- Ben Jonson
