The Seasons’ Tapestry

Spring blooms with colors, a vibrant display,
Summer’s warmth holds the world at bay,
Autumn paints leaves in amber hues,
Winter cloaks all in a blanket of blues.

Each season whispers its own sweet song,
A tapestry woven, where all belong,
Nature’s rhythms, a cycle embraced,
In harmony’s dance, we’re forever faced.

- David C Okwuosa
