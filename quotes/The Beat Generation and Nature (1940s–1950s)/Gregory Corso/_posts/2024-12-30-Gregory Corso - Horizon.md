Horizon
by Gregory Corso

A horizon
that breaks all chaos
is now a child in me,
spooning the clouds,
giggling against morn,
a clumsy lover
lifting the veil of silence.

They think I’m from sorrow,
but I tell them
it’s only a donkey
swimming through gleam,
a black rabbit
looking for wishes.
From above,
each drop of dew
glimmers like clarity,
a secret tapestry of stories
nestling past the mysteries.

I think of the sea,
a rolling laugh, a heart
flinging itself and dancing
with the stars, smiling, peeking
- I’m free with it!

- Gregory Corso
