A Farewell to the Woods  

Farewell to the woods, with thy whispering trees,  
Farewell to thy flowers and boats on the seas!  
They have borne me safe by, where the waters gleam,  
Now I am left to dream of the poet's dream.  

Farewell to the shadows, and valleys deep,  
Where the winds chant low, as the night winds creep!  
Adieu! thou soft zephyr, thy mellow notes die,  
I spread forth my arms to the azure sky!  

For be it known to thee, that I long to stay,  
With each whispering hour to pass in the day!  
So gently I leave, oh, thy beauty divine —  
Where time and eternity sweetly align!

- Thomas Hood
