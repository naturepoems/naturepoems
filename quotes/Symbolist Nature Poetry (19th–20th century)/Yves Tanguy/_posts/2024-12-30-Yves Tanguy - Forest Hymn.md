The forest breathes, a sacred hymn,  
Trees tangled in forgotten lore,  
A tapestry of branches slim,  
In shadows deep, the spirits soar.

Moss carpeted paths where echoes tread,  
Flickering fireflies weave the night,  
Cloaked in silence, thoughts unsaid,  
Nature's verse, in soft twilight.


- Yves Tanguy
