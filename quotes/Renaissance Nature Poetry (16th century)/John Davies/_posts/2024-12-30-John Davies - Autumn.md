Autumn

O golden months, whose harvest blights  
The branches where the leaves fall down;  
Thy beauty fills the endless sights  
Of nature wearing amber crown.

Thy breezes blow, the whispers say  
Of changing times, of loveâ€™s delight;  
The chill of morning, born of gray,  
Gives depth to every autumn night.

O fleeting, gentle season's grace,  
Bring forth the wine of thoughts divine;  
With every amber touch we trace,  
Reflects the light from thine own shine.

- John Davies
