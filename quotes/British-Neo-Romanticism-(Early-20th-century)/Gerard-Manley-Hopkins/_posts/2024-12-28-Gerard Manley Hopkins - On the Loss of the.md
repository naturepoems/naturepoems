On the Loss of the Timothy

Once a meadow loaded with Timothy,
  Much blue boughs there waved in wind,
  Soft silver strokes of weeds in flower,
And all those thriving lives were spun.

But if sometimes we attend to good,
  And in our hearts may bloom that space,
  O fields to share the joys of may!
As in the echoing lift of songs.

May the meadow grow, though Timothy’s gone,
  Lovely the sight not lost, yet all the more grown;.
Here, a light heart’s masterwork, even now shall stay,
  Then let its large delight display.

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
