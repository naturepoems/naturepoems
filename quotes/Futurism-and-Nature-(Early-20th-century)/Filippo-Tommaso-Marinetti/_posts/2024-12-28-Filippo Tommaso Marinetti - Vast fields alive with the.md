Vast fields, alive with the hum
    of millions of insects,
    pulse in time with the desires
    of industrious creatures
    reaping, sowing, thrivingâ€”
    an orchestra of life in moist soil.

Let us celebrate our industrial love!
    Hands ready to mold,
    the clay of earth and sweat,
    into a new utopia, a new beauty.

- Filippo Tommaso Marinetti
