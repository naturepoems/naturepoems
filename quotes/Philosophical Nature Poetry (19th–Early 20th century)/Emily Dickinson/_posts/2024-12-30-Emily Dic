A Light exists in Spring  
Not present on the Year  
At any other period –  
When March is scarcely here –  

A Color stands abroad  
On Cold, Protracted Days –  
It waits upon the Lawn –  
It shows the furrows – raised –  

And lives through all the Fall  
And Winter until June  
And never in the Living Day—  
But only in the Moon –  


- Emily Dickinson
