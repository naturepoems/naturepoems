What is it to be an element
Enfolded in water, air, and earth?
To flourish with the vitality
Of the green valley’s breath,
To pulse with the rhythm of the stars—
To know neither sadness nor regret.
Nature may pen her elegies,
But we—
Embodied like the luminous light,
Are the verses: the wild floras,
In their violation, in their beauty.
We dance like the sunlit leaves,
Forget the mundane, imprint
On destiny's heart,
Where songbirds echo the commands of thunder,
And time is but a flutter of dust.
Let us breathe together,
In the communion of eternal bloom.
This is our nature; here lies our truth.

- Mina Loy
