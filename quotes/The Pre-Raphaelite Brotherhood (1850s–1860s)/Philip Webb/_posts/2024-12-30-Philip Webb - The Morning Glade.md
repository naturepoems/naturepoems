The Morning Glade

A shimmer breaks on dew-kissed leaves,
In morning's glow, the silence weaves.
Awake, the earth in pastel hues,
The tender light, a muse imbues.

Gentle murmurs fill the air,
As petals dance without a care;
The essence of the dawn renews,
In every shade, the world imbues.

I stand in awe of nature's grace,
Each moment a rare, fleeting trace;
And as the day ignites the sky,
In morning's glade, my spirit flies.


- Philip Webb
