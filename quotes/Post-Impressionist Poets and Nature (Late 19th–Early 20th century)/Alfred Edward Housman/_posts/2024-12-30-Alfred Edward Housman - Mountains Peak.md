Oft have I sought the mountain’s peak,
Where silence reigns and words grow weak,
For there I find my deepest thought,
In nature’s arms, my battles fought.

With every climb, a freedom grows,
A spirit free, the journey knows,
In shadowed trails, the stars will lead,
Through nature’s heart, my soul is freed.


- Alfred Edward Housman
