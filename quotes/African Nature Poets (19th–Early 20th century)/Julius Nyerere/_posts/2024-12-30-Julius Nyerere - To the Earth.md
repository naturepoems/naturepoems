Our father, creating a beautiful land,
Took dust from it and made man,
Blew life into his nostrils,
And saw that it was good.

This land we cherish, our home.
From mountain high to valley low,
The whispering winds, the rushing rivers,
The dancing trees, our silent friends.

If we respect this earth, our earth,
It will nurture our needs, fulfill our dreams;
In its embrace, we feel alive,
In its balance, we find our peace.


- Julius Nyerere
