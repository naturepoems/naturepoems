Twilight
As day draws close, the sky ignites,
In hues of orange, red, and lights.
A gentle hush upon the land,
The twilight paints with a loving hand.

Crickets serenade the night,
A soothing balm, a pure delight,
In this hour where dreams take flight,
Nature cradles us so tight.


- Antonio SantElia
