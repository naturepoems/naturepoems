The Wind and the Trees
  
The wind blew all that afternoon,
And all the evening sea,
With a loud laugh of laughter,
But its mocking voice was free.  
A stream of leaves and branches swayed  
While the child clung sore,
And I stood watch while trees swayed,
And the sun went down before.

I could not go without my friend,
The child who had no fear.
He made me laugh against the mind,
Confessed a child's delight.  
Night whispered of the high, green sky,
And birds flew above my fear.
I only could but stand and grin,  
And feel more grand.
