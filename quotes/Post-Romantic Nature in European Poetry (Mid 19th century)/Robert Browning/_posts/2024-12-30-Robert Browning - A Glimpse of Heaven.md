And yet it is a glorious thing 
         To see such courage in the pest! 
         A sky above, a wall of fine ; 
         The sun on every longing sense, 
         And so the hills, the woodlands green, 
         The vale and distant river glinting! 
         How, dotted through the open space, 
         The restless, keen-intellect in motion, 
         Surge of the human soul, and face! 
         The noise of man no more shall drown 
         The melancholy sound of night!

- Robert Browning
