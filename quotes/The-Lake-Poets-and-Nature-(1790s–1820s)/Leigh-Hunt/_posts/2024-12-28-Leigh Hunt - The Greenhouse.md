The Greenhouse  
Here the green leaves beneath our feet,  
Smell of the sunlit air,  
The tulips hanging out their lips,  
And roses straying, bright and rare.  
The birds that sing around,  
Drink of the fragrant vale;  
While here within we watch the root  
Gathering joy through sunshine and hail.

- Leigh Hunt
