O, what a sight, the open field,
With golden wheat that bows so low;
The bounty Nature has revealed,
In every stalk, in every glow.

The clouds drift high, the skies are clear,
Life’s richness spills on every side;
In nature’s heart, there’s naught to fear,
For all is whole, and all is wide.


- William Browne
