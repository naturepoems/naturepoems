Snow

White cascades enfold,
   every sound, a shrouded hush,
     muted mirth in crystalline.
The stillness sings,
   a trembling hush wanders,
            invisibly etched, no footfall.
As I slip into the chill — some warmth, 
   a glow in the frosted light —
becomes shadows, soft and balmy,
     like winter's heavy breath.

- Lorine Niedecker
