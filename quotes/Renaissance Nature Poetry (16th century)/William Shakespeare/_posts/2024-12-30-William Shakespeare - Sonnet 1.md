From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
But as the ripe should grow, all must comply;
In the very fount of life, their love's release.
And in this glorious world, we shall have peace,
For each spring blooms in summer's arms nearby,
While all that we all love you know they sigh,
To fight the passage of time's great decrease.

   We hold until daylight catches sighs,
   When crimson leaves fall, ope the heart’s new score,
   And the bliss of union would supply the sun,
   Living long years in harmony’s place,
   Unto the grave, then shall race be done.
   And still, we keep within our memories keen!

— Sonnet 1

- William Shakespeare
