Spring

I
  In springtime's arms, I find my breath,
     Where violets dance in colors gay,
     With sunny light that banishes death,
     The heart rejoices in the play.

II
  The streams, like laughter, ripple free,
     Along the path where blossoms sing,
     In every bud, a mystery,
     That whispers what the seasons bring.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
