In the Middle of the Street

like a beehive,
the street
holds an endless
hum of motion,

of cars and bicycles,
of children laughing,
shouting,
of the scraped knees
of a boy at play.

In this life,
I am a bee,
collecting nectar from
the flowers
of the earth
and sky.

I search for sweetness
in the chaos around me,
hovering, landing,
feeling the sun's warmth
on my wings,

and in this dance
of existence,
I find my library
of moments.

Each tiny moment,
like a grain of pollen,
applied to the pages
of my mind
creates a bloom,
a new idea.

We are alive
and this street
is a garden of dreams,
a bridge between
the seen and unseen,

in this buzzing,
this hum, this throbbing
life,
I find my song.

- Diane di Prima
