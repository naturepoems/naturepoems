Clouds

Racing high,
  the clouds gather,
a torrent rushes, always commas,
yet none are complete.
They brush light upon waves,
  as thunder rolls over,
while the ground dances
  beneath the scent of damp.
The moisture lasts in memory—
  promises kept
  held in the shimmering air.


- Robert Creeley
