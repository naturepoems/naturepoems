I dreamed of flowers and sunny skies,
   Of paths adorned in sweetest throng,
Where bees caught bvapour in their cries
   And every voice broke forth in song.

A silver stream ran bright below,
   The breezes danced on every ear,
And in serene and tender glow,
   I found the world was bright and clear.

- John Clare
