The Courtin'

```
There’s a...mossy...stone,
Where quite a while
The leaves are...tangled...:
A memory here...
Between
And there,
The summer blooms...
Where loveliness...
May never fade away

When it set, the sun below,
And casting down the shades,
And hear the crickets’ echoing,
In Nature’s melodies.

Time stood still;
The breeze did gently sway
When whisperings of heaven
Stood every leaf at play!...
```


- James Russell Lowell
