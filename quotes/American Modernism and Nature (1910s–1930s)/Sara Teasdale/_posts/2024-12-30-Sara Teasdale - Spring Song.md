I shall be glad
when the green of the earth
and the blue of the sky
come back, for I am weary of the winter.

But I long for the spring
to lift the wings of the night,
to bring the air fresh and sweet
and the sun warm and bright.

To see the trees filled with new leaves,
to hear the dance of the wind
and to feel the stir of the world,
Oh, I shall be glad.  

The return of color,
the touch of fragrance of flowers,
the song of the birds,
all shall come back to my heart.

- Sara Teasdale
