Cascades of blossoms paint the world anew,
An artist’s palette set upon the lawn;
Every flower a note in nature’s score,
Blossoming boldly beneath the warm sun.

The bees hum a tune of sweet devotion,
While butterflies dance in delicate air;
With each sunrise shrouded in gold,
Life awakens in the rhythm we share.

- Anna de Noailles
