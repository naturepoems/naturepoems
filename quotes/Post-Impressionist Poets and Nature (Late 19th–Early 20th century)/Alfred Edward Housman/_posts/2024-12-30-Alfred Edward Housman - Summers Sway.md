The green of leaves in summer’s sway,
The blooms that join a bright array,
Are marks of nature’s tender care,
Embracing life, as if a prayer.

In gardens vast, where flowers sway,
Their scent will linger, fade away,
Yet in the heart, the memory stays,
Of summer’s joys and forest ways.


- Alfred Edward Housman
