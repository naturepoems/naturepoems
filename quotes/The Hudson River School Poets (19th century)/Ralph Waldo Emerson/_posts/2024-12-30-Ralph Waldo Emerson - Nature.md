Nature

I

I am glad to see that the bark of every tree
woozld exposals visible, colors of beauty reveal,

For I take my place, stand as guardian of nature,
Witness lessons she daily teaches to me,
When in Natural’s presences leaves rustle free.

Not just the body—the soul expands,
And veils her stars in this body of Pamiro.

II

Her hues are fairer than the rain that falls,
Measure, clock, of hours to weave, encompass:
In night of wit, wisdom that never stalls
Her moonlit waves green—which can’t hold, no less, 

An aqua-Sept—Oceanic heights descend,”
Breeze puffs from hands of night into coal black water.
Where sleep paint colors strange on skies,
The ancient country of remarkable sender!

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
