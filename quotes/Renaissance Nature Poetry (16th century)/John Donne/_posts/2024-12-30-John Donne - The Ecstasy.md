The Ecstasy

Where, like a pillow you rest, resolving
Two souls together inseparably twinned,
And she encircles warmth over years evolving
And takes to heart the dawn and what it pins.

What made that quiet night without a thought,
Ran circuits through the spark of love held fast,
In this pale twilight, love's fine gesture caught,
And wonders: o'er the sanctuary shall it last?

Where can such love, almost meet the wings,
That toss them to a far-off sacred sphere?
They find their quiet joys adorned in rings,
Desiring freedom held; what truly appears,

At last, as two no longer can confine,
When pure, untroubled echoes make desire divine!

- John Donne
