The river flows, a vein of deep desire,
carving through the rocks, its story unfolds.

Each ripple holds a memory,
a moment in time slipping past.

A dance of light and shadow,
a flicker of golden sun on the surface.

Listen closely to the water's heart,
it speaks in a language only nature knows.

- Kate Bush
