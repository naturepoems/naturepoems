In the depth of the forest, where shadows ensconce,  
a harmony dwells in nature’s true response.  
Each leaf whispers secrets, each branch tells a tale,  
in the cradle of silence, where all dreams prevail.

The brook dances gently, with soft, murmuring calls,  
as sunlight filters down through the green, fluttering halls.  
Life pulses around in a rhythmic embrace,  
where the wild world abounds, and the heart finds its place.

- Émile Zola
