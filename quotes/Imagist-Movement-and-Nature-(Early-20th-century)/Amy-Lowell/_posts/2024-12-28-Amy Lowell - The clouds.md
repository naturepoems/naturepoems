The clouds drift,
In slow procession,
Buoyant sails,
Embroidered with dreams.
A blue canvas beckons,
To the wanderer’s heart,
And the winds, gentle magicians,
Paint sunlit pathways,
For the soul to tread,
In the vast expanse of sky.

Above, a wild song,
Of freedom sings,
And the spirit soars,
With every passing breeze.

— Amy Lowell
