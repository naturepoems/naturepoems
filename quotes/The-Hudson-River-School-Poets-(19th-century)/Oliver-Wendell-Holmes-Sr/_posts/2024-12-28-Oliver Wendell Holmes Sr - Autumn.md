Autumn

When ancient trees in glory stand,
Stretched, upon their golden lands,
With summer leaves that gleam like gold,
And glowing stars at eve, behold.

And every glade and sun-streaked hill,
Whispers its secret breeze, to thrill,
Breath of the forest in harvest glow,
A silence deep, a world we know.

Embrace the sighs of fall’s true heart,
As gilded wings through daylight part.
A swelling song resounds the way,
As beauty calls through autumn’s sway.

- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr
