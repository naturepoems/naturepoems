The Starry Night
Above the hills, where shadows play,  
The stars in velvet skies pour light,  
And in the moon’s softening sway,  
My spirit soars in blissful flight.  
The satin sheen of night’s embrace  
Invites each wandering star to bring  
The peaceful look upon my face,  
For quiet hours their praises sing.

Each constellation—bold and bright,  
Within the tapestry I weave,  
The dreams of night, the pure delight  
Of nature’s hand, its tricks conceives;  
And in such moments of the eves,  
I feel the universe so near,  
In starry wonder—dreams achieves  
Within the night, my heart sincere.

- Charlotte M Smith
