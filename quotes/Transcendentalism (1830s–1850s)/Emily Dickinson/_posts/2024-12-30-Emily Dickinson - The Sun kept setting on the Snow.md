The Sun kept setting on the Snow  
And on the Houses too –  
As if the day had been a Fairy  
Doling out all the Snowflakes, too –  

There filled a room with Hills and Dales –  
But all lost in the Frost  
As if the Blackbird had sung  
And all of Nature – had Lost –  

The Sun – looked – unresisting now –  
Upon the crushed within –  
As if a Portrait – held its Breath  
As long as it had found a Friend –

- Emily Dickinson
