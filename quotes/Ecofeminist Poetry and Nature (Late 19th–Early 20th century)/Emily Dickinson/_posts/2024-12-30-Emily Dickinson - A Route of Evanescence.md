A Route of Evanescence  
With a revolving drive –  
A Death – of blaze – denied  
The light!  

And I,  
Too sweetly fell,  
And I was there –  
In love immediately!  

For the Day grew older,  
And the Hours, too –  
I feared as never before  
In only shades of blue.  

When the Woodlands glassed in  
The Walks here – forever –  
And were eternally brightening,  
Oh, lovely –  

From elfin woods –  
Ethereal flame –  
For the journey had no end –  
In earthly bliss!  


- Emily Dickinson
