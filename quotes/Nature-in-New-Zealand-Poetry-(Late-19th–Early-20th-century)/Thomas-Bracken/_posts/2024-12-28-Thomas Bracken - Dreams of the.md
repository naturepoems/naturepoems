Dreams of the Sea
 
When twilight falls soft on the hills,
And the stars peek shyly from night,
The rivers give echoes of thrills,
In a world that glimmers with light.

With whispers of waves on the shores,
And the night-gale calls from afar,
How my heart dances, endless it soars,
In the glow of each shimmering star.

Lost in the vastness, we roam,
Floating free as a spirit may be—
In deep at the ocean's soft foam,
I dream in the embrace of the sea.

- Thomas Bracken
