Life of the Stream

Down the mountain, the stream winds forth,
A silver ribbon, pure and bright,
It sings of ages, of journeys long,
Beneath the canopy's soft light.

Each twist and turn, a story flows,
Of raindrops gathered, of time embraced,
Carving valleys, shaping stones,
In its path, the past is traced.

And in its depths, the fish flicker,
Life thrives in every gentle bend,
The stream, a pulse of nature's heart,
A journey without end.

- Torrenti Orazio
