The Tuft

In a grassy tuft by the lane,
Where wildflowers dance in gentle clime,
I sat, with thoughts that felt like rain,
And breathed in nature, slow and fine.

Here, silence held a symphony,
In every leaf a secret kept,
Among the strands of harmony,
I felt my soul, once more, adept.


- Edward Thomas
