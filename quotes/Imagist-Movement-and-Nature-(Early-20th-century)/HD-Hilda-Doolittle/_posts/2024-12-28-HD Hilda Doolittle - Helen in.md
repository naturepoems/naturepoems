Helen in Egypt

   Eyes of the sea,  
   myriads of rain—  
   enormities yield;  
   vast tremors linger
   in clashing waters,  
   loosened boughs  
   of a darkened sea,
   tilting world,_
   guess at blossoms.
   5
   Oys of the sea,  
   you turn me around,
   lift me clear as skies,
   through the deep stair-blood
   lust over-layering  
   the tide—  
   meet me, fall—  
   the fallen boughs  
   gather together,

- HD Hilda Doolittle
