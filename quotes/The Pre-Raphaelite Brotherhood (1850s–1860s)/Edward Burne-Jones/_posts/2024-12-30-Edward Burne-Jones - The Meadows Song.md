The Meadow's Song
 
In fields of green where daisies play,  
A melody of life resounds,  
With gentle whispers of the day,  
A symphony of nature found.  

The sunlit blooms, they sway and dance,  
On breezes warm, a joyous throng,  
In every petal, pure romance,  
The meadow sings its timeless song.

- Edward Burne-Jones
