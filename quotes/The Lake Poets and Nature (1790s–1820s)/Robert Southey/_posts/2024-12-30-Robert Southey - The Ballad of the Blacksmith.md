The Ballad of the Blacksmith

A Tale of Old.

One by one they came to see,
  The blacksmith of the brook;
And many a heart was given free
  In all his joyful look;
So sweetly did he sing, and ply
  His forge, a Princess proud:
And oh! the spirits twinkled nigh,
  And sang, how they sang loud!

The fair sang spell, the braver claim,
  And male were comes gusty;
While bent, as bright in every hand,
  Deliver'd swift and trusty;
To forge where gentleness prescribed,
  As holes held by so near;
For oh! the heart that forged so tim’d,
  Was light ’twixt crown and tear!

- Robert Southey
