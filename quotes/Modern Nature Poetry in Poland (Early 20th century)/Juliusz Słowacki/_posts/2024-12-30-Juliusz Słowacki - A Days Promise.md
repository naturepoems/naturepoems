The dawn breaks with a blush of gold,
A promise whispered, a tale retold.
The sun ascends, with fiery grace,
Awakening all in nature's embrace.

In the fields where the wild ones roam,
I find my spirit, my heart, my home.
Each day unfolds like a story clear,
In the beauty of nature, I hold dear.

So let me wander where the wildflowers sway,
In the arms of the land, let me stay.
For in every sunrise, every serene sigh,
I find the essence of life passing by.


- Juliusz Słowacki
