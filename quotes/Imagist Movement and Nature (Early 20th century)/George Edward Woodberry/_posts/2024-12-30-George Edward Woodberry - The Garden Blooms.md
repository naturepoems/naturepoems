The garden blooms—there, beauty reigns,
Where laughter bursts from every tree,
And peace in breathing fragrant rains,
The gentle heart finds harmony.

With petals keen as dawn's first breath,
And scents of honeyed bliss so dear,
My soul finds life, escapes from death,
In nature's realm, forever near.

- George Edward Woodberry
