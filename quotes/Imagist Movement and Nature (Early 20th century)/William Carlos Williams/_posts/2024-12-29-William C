The Last Day

Now that you will gone,
  that I will know you
  from the corner of the garden,
  I begin to give you up,
each season,
of the heart,
of the sky,
so outside the city
  the night sweeps,
or the autumn,
that long angle of this sun,
undiluted return, heartfelt dark.

Alas,
years come down
  a falling face, lit
  by fond rays,
who can rest with this,
as you tell me, planted
your grace under the fruit,
for pleasure; quenched.

Nothing more,
  I am gone.
Awaits in vain.

- William Carlos Williams
