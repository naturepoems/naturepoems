Touch of the Sun
The sun dips low, an artist
splashing gold across the horizon,
a final stroke before it retreats
into the embrace of night.

We stand in its glow,
anointed in warmth,
a fleeting moment of closeness
before the coolness settles.
The day whispers its goodbyes,
while the stars prepare to dance—
a cosmic ballet at twilight.

- Francis Picabia
