When dawn breaks to gild the horizon anew,
And the world blushes soft in a tender debut.
The robins proclaim with a jubilant cheer,
As the earth wakes from slumber, the skies reappear.

The petals unfold from their velvety night,
Bathing in sunlight, awash in delight.
Each flower a painter, in colors they bloom,
In the tapestry woven, dispelling the gloom.

The valleys hold laughter, the mountains stand proud,
In the whispering winds, they sing soft and loud.
With the grace of the heavens, the spirit takes flight,
In the arms of creation, we revel in light.

So tread softly, dear wanderer, cherish the air,
In the symphony playing, in moments so rare.
For nature's a canvas, where life finds its song,
In the beauty surrounding, we ever belong.

- H V Morton
