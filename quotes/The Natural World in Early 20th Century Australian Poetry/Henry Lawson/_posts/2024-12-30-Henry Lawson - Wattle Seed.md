Wattle Seed

The wattle blooms in fragrance rare,
A golden crown for Earth to wear,
While shadows dance in playful glee,
Underneath the ancient tree.

Let the gentle breeze unfold
All the tales of hearts of old,
In the blossoms, bright and fresh,
Life renews in every flesh.

So let the song of beauty reign,
In the heart that knows no pain,
Let the love for nature swell,
In the wattleâ€™s bloom we tell.

- Henry Lawson
