Whispers of the Wild
  
  My soul is stirred by wildwood tales,
  Of every creature’s secret trails;
  The rustling leaves, the creaking boughs,
  The stories shared beneath the clouds.
  
  In hidden nooks, the shadows play,
  As sunlight filters through the day;
  Each breeze that blows, a voice that calls,
  To wander where the silence falls.
  
  The fox, the deer, the wise old owl,
  In twilight’s glow, they softly prowl;
  Their laughter echoes in the dark,
  Resounding through the woodland park.
