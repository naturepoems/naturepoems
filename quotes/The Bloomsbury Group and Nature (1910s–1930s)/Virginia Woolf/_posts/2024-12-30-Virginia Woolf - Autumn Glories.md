In the autumn, we see
The gold upon the trees,
Glimmering, turned to flame-like
Branches, festive shrines—
An architecture of nature's
Glory,
Resounding with the crackle
Of its folly, down to the ground,
In swirling pockets of air, cool to the touch,
Fragrant with decay.

— **Virginia Woolf, Autumn Glories**
