The Autumn Song

When the leaves lie breached,
Falling like old memories,
As the twilight zones grow long,
I hear the song of autumn,
Calling with harmony,
Echoing through the woods,
Sweet melodic whispers, into
The drifting shallows of the night.
Endless cycles, forging beauty,
In the breath of each birdâ€™s call,
Singing kindness to the trees,
With soft eyes we fade,
Into the mottled embrace of dusk,
Awakening roots of fire.
When snows come,
We will listen yet, together,
To the whispers of autumn skies.

- Gary Snyder
