Ode to the fir tree,
How strong your embrace,
A fortress of green
In the rain-soaked place.
Your scent is a promise,
Of the earth, of the sky,
In the rainy breath
Of the clouds passing by.

Through storms you stand steady,
With roots deep and wide,
A sentinel watching
With grace and with pride.
So to you, ancient guardian,
I offer my praise,
For the life that you foster
Through the haze of the days.

- Emily Carr
