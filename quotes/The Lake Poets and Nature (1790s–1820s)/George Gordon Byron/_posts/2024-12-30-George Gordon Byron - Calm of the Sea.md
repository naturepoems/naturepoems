The sea is calm tonight,
The tide is at its flow;
The moon sails through the night,
With a soft silver glow.

The waves caress the shore,
A gentle, whispered sigh,
In nature's quiet lore,
Our souls begin to fly.

The stars show us the way,
Through the deep ocean’s dance,
While love will ever stay,
A blissful secret glance.

- George Gordon Byron
