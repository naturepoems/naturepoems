The Forest Sanctuary

Within the forest shade, a sacred spot,
Where Nature her soft whisper makes,
The sacred altar of the heart unlot,
Untouched by all that earth forsakes.

Here twilight’s calm descends, with silvery grace,
And o’er the tender leaves there falls,
A spirit’s touch, a sense of sweet embrace,
As evening to each sombre whisper calls.

A sanctuary from the world’s harsh din,
Bringing peace unto the heavy-laden heart,
Where time’s relentless course may cease to win,
Here hope and gratitude in prayer depart.

Oh woodland beauty, hold us safe and dear,
Let thy fragrance lift each sorrow near.

—Felicia Hemans
