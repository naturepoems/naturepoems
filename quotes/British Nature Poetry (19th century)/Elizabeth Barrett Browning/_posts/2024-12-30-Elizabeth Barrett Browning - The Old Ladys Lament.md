A lady, very old and rich,
Sat in her castle with a golden stitch;
She wove and wove, till twilight came,
With the singing of an evening flame.
She wove blue skies and white curled seas,
Curled seas of silver against the trees;
She wove bright moons and stars too,
A tapestry of cheerfulness, you see too.
She wooed and wooed till dusk's decline,
Each stroke of grace, each delicate line.
Till the waves of a hundred evening skies,
In her loom of gold and silver rise!

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
