The River

I stood beside the bank so clear,  
Where nature poured its laughter near,  
And all around, the wild blooms leapt  
To touch the riverbreak and kept  
Their leaves so green, their smiles so happy;  
The current took me where it’s sappy.  

And here, between its bending course,  
The spirits dared me to share the force;  
Would I linger here, where time stood still,  
And pluck each blossom yet not kill.  

Into the grain of water I watched  
As the dance of leaves flowed so farfetched,  
Where every animal drank year's regards,  
Loud in their laughter, they left no guards.  

So I left that sweet summer's scheme,  
With the wallow of the river that gleamed,  
To that purest faith that nature bears;  
And back in time I marveled, it dares.

- Edward Thomas
