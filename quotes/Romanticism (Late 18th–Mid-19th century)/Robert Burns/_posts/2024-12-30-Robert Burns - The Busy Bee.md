The bee, to bore the lily’s life,
Is busy in the sun;
And every flower that blooms in light
Must bear a golden crown.

So when you see the sun descend,
And evening shadows fall;
Remember that true love transcends,
And nature bears it all.

Let’s pause to hear the evening sigh,
As nightingales make tune;
In every star lit in the sky,
Is love’s eternal boon.

- Robert Burns
