As day breaks softly, painting the sky,  
With strokes of pink where the larkbirds fly;  
The lushness of green wraps the world in a dream,  
As nature awakens, a delicate theme.  

From the whispering woods to the shimmering lake,  
Each note of creation sings as I wake;  
In the grandeur around me, my soul finds its worth,  
A bond with the beauty, the wonder of earth.

- Lucy Maud Montgomery
