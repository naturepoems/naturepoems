In the Hills

The hills stand still, the valley green,
In peaceful shade and glow, serene,
A sentinel at dusk that binds,
Gaping holes in dreams it finds.

As shadows stretch and yawns unfold,
The night’s embrace, a tale retold,
The stars ignite the role above,
Each twinkle a brush, a feathered love.

For in these heights the thoughts arise,
On every peak, my spirit flies,
Among the blossoms that grace the loam,
I find my refuge, my tidy home.

- Dorothy Wordsworth
