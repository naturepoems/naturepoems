Spring's Arrival  
When springtime wakes the sleeping earth,  
And gentle breezes bring the mirth,  
The buds unfold, the flowers bloom,  
All nature bursts from winter's gloom.  

The brooklets dance with joyous thrill,  
The birds return to vale and hill;  
In every glade, in every grove,  
The world awakens filled with love.
