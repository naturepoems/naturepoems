The Sun is but a morning star.

           Wake up
           And cast your eyes
           On me,
           My face of muse, brightness,
           Symbol of glory,
           Dream of your waking sleep.

William Blake lingers 
In every breeze that softly sways
Through ancient trees.
The sun that warms the earth
Awakens every life,
Gestures wide and careless,
To the lily and the rose
In a mound of yellow
Bursting through the snow.

From deep slumber wrenched,
The lark leaps to the sky,
Reaching for heavenâ€™s heights.
Each day it rises,
Every note, a whisper of love,
Of faithfulness rolling down
The unbroken valleys.

Ah! Forget not, my dear,
Time is but measure,
A thread through memory,
Woven gently, spun fine,
In silence, art, and callf
Of warmth to keep us whole.

So, rise, rise, once more..
For the sun is still a morning star.

- Edward Thomas
