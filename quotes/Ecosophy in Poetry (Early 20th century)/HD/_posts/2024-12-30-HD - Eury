Eurydice

You are so great that
I can only think of you
In the smallest ways.
But a flower pinched in my hand, 
Cradled in leaf and petal
Is the closing flower, 
And when it is made to blossom, 
I think of youâ€”
A bloom so sweet, 
Wrapped warm within its own embrace,
I can think of no other.

Oh, my dear, where are you?
In the wasteland, where the roots
In the earth invite no familiar grasp.
