Snow-Covered Pines

Minding the silence,
Simplicity draped in white robes,
Each needle stands adorned,
Frozen fingers cradle the earth
As I step to the edge,
Feeling time’s careful pause,
This quiet veil of frost lifts
In the breath of dawn,
Over our stillness, a chant of hearts.
We live in these moments,
As whispers attract all senses—
The bright weight of nature amends,
Steps of hope pay heed,
A promise whispering from trees,
Let us linger in grace,
Remembering the soft folds of snow.

- Gary Snyder
