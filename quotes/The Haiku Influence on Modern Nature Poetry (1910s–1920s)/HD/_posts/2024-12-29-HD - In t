In the stillness of the night,
Where breezes call, whispering lonesome ideas,
I have my voice, my heart remembers,
Each star unfurls a note, that lingers and rings,
With crickets tapping soft as lost lovers.
The moon, high and round, watches,
Where earth’s shadows play—how dreams rise,
From fallen leaves among the trees—
Together we roam, tracing paths in the skies.
