Evening

Evening settles in her wings,  
  
While dusk sweeps soft and kind  
  
Each wandering, whispered glance.

Let thine soul unfurl her light  
  
To greet the air composed of dew  
  
And soar high through filigree dreams,

Deep in the stillness of night  
  
We blend with stars refrained,  
  
To escape each mute and weary thought,  
  
And play in wander-lights of love. 

So dance and grow in humble grace,  
  
Through whispers round the confluence  
  
Let every day dissolve a sound
  
And travel green, forever more.
