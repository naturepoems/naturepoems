quote: "The shallow brook goes bubbling,
A mossy stone moves, a leaf drops,
The image of water, vibrant,
The essence of being, talks
Simply to the skies, rippling,
And the weeping trees above."

The shallow brook goes bubbling,
A mossy stone moves, a leaf drops,
The image of water, vibrant,
The essence of being, talks
Simply to the skies, rippling,
And the weeping trees above.

- Marianne Moore
