Open the window; let the air
Blow through the room, and bear
Away the thickest memories,
Keep an eye on ancient trees.
        
The roots are tangled in the past:
Remind me not of dreams unasked.
Let sunlight filter through the cracks,
Where verdant growth and reason lack.
        
We stand beneath the open sky,
Our hearts unsheathed; we do not lie.
The trees will whisper praise and care,
While daylight dances everywhere.

- Philip Larkin
