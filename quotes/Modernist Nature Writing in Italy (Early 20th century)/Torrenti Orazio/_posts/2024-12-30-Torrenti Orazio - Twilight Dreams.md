Twilight Dreams

As day descends into evening's veil,
The world softens under twilight's brush,
Colors melt in the fading light,
In quietude, the hearts all hush.

Fireflies dance in the dusky air,
Creating stars where shadows play,
The scent of night blooms fills the breeze,
Embracing whispers at close of day.

Here in this dusk, dreams take their flight,
In the folds of twilight, hope is spun,
With every breath, the world slows down,
As night awakens and day is done.

- Torrenti Orazio
