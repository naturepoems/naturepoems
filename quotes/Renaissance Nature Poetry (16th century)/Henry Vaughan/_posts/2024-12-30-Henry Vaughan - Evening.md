How soon doth the evening draw nigh!  
Yet what warmth in this gentle light!  
The sun doth kiss the day goodbye,  
And shadows grow, yet my heart feels right.

Beneath the stars, the world transforms,  
The cool night air breathes love on me;  
In every rustling leaf, it warmsâ€”  
Nature's breath, a sweet decree.

--- "Evening"

- Henry Vaughan
