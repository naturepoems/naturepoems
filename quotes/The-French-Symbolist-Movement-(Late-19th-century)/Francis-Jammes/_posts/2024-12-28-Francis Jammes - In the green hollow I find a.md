In the green hollow, I find a brook,
Wandering softly, untouched by feet.
It runs through the frosted ferns,
Whispering secrets to the willows,
A shimmering ribbon in the grass,
Around flint and moss it plays,
Until it traces paths unseen,
A sweet and silent serenade.

Beneath this azure sky,
Eagerly my spirit alights,
To wander where the wild flowers grow,
In colors bold against the gentle hue.
I sigh as I dip my hands into
The cool embrace of natureâ€™s song.

- Francis Jammes
