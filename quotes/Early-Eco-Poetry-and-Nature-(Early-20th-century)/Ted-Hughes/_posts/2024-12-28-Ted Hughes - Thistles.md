Thistles
In the broken land,
the thistles arise,
a stubborn array,
a universe of green spears,
yearning for light,
shaking out their challenge;
a noble defiance of will.
Each bloom bursts in purple,
stretching far and wide,
a testament
against the ruins of man.
Their roots claw deep
into the heart of the earth,
take the burden to beat,
a clarity alive—
a touch of nature's triumph,
bound by the very soil that binds.

Where clumsy hands will come—
the thistles resist,
their brazen beauty a hymn,
a wild symphony riding high,
a purpose in each thorny crown.

- Ted Hughes
