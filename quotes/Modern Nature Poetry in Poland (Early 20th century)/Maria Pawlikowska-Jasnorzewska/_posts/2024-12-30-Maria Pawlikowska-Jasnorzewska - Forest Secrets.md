The fragrance of pine fills the air,
as I walk along the forest path,
with each step a connection to the earth,
a reminder of the ancient wisdom held within.

Sunlight filters through the branches,
a golden embrace that warms the soul,
whispers of the forest beckon,
as if to share its secrets,
a world alive with stories,
a tapestry woven by natureâ€™s hand.
