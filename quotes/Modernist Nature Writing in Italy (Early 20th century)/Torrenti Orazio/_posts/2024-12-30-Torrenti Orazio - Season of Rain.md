Season of Rain

The gentle patter on rooftops sings,
A lullaby to the earth below,
With every drop, the world is washed,
In the season of rain, life starts to grow.

Rivers swell with the tender gift,
Fields drink deeply from the sky,
Each puddle mirrors dreams anew,
In this slumber, we learn to fly.

So let the clouds gather and weep,
For in their tears, a promise lies,
Of growth, of life, of the sacred cycle,
In the season of rain, love never dies.

- Torrenti Orazio
