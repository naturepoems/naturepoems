Beneath the arch of heaven wide,
  I roam through fields of fragrant blooms,
  The sky a canvas, swift and wide,
  The sun dispels the morning glooms.

Each flower a story, each tree a song,
  They speak of solace and of grace,
  In harmony where I belong,
  A moment’s peace, a sacred space.

- Isaak Walton
