The Farmer

  The farmer stands with hopeful eye,
  A dream of riches in his mind;
  As through the fields, with a sigh,
  He turns the soil, awake and kind.

  The sun will span the autumn days,
  And guide the harvest to his farm;
  In nature’s sweet, unending ways,
  He’ll reap the profits of his charm.


- John Greenleaf Whittier
