A roof of branches,
Starlit, whispering,
Pattering rainsts and hushing
Night, a veil.
Bring forth the night bird,
The call so low,
A flutter of wings,
In the softest glow,
Where light drips
Like honey from boughs,
And all is mystic cool,
In this temple of the night.

— **Virginia Woolf, Nightfall**
