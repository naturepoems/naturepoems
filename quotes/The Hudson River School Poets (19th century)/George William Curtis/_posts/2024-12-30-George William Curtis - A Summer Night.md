A Summer Night

In the tranquil hour of twilight’s glow, 
When sylvan peace and pleasure flow, 
Beneath the arch of heaven wide, 
The restless spirit finds its guide. 

The stars awake, the moon looks down, 
With silver crown the night’s renown; 
And all is calm and softly bright— 
Ah! the magic of a summer night. 

In fragrant woods the soft winds sigh, 
The owl hoots softly from the sky; 
The shimmer of the streams appears, 
Like liquid gems to bind our tears. 

Absorbed in this celestial scene, 
We seem to touch on the unseen; 
With nature’s breath a soul takes flight, 
To live anew that summer night.

- George William Curtis
