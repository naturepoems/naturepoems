The tranquil lake, reflecting skies above,  
A mirror holds the essence of the day;  
In every ripple, whispers of deep love,  
For Nature's heart lays bare, and here we stay.  

With every dawn, the gilded sun shall rise,  
And fill our hearts with dreams of endless flight;  
Beneath the boughs, enfolded by sweet sighs,  
Find solace rooted in the heart of night.
