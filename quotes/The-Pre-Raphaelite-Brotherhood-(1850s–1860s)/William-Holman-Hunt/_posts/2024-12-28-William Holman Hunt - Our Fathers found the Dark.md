Our Fathers found the Dark; 
They knelt and called on thee 
For Light; 
And thou didst hear, and light began; 
And they were high with sun, 
And filled with Peace, 
On this fair day, 
With golden boughs of trees, 
Joshing them; 
O earth, awake!  
Whose beautiful young feet, 
I clasp; 
So free to tread under 
The first of earth, 
These old ones; 
With those brown cheeks!  
Ah, the past,  
Unfolding in sunsets of wild color. 


- William Holman Hunt
