The Woodland Scene


  Thine is the sullen oak where the winds ineffective 
  Wail in the hollow night of the copses wild;  
  Where long time hath flown without thought, ineffectively,  
  The thought of the trembling leaf for the child;  
  Thine the stillness and oulongs,  
  The dampness and now the high -  
  The thistle that wafts at dusk, to assist thee  
  Among the green of the days that belong:  
  The willow missed in the balmy time  
  When gazing as that of the man, didst grieve.
