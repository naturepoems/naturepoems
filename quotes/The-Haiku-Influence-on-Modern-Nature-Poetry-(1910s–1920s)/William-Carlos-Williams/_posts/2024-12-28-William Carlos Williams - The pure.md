The pure products
of America

go crazy—

mountain folk

from the hills,

leafy vegetables,

sugar and cream—

meanwhile the black

cows chew cud

and the patient

sow waits

for the sun.

I like them
all—

these products

of our Gilded Age.

Now at the end

of this earth

we will go with

our pots,

at least,

and sow sweet corn

in soft earth.

- William Carlos Williams
