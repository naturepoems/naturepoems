To Whistler, American
Among the verdure, leaves and branches
Sway like the winds of God!
We, young, are cloaked as travelers
To the altar of the highest skies
And by your light and laughter we flourish.
The shiver of making peace,
Perfect as the bird's sun
In the sun's eye over lakes,
My hand upon thy hand
Pulled from the breezy mist.
In a blue gown covered with showers,
Swaying on time's ways.
Who hath spoken like a feather in the full
Breeze?
Ah! Let us wind the hour through 
The leafy paths of Ndisho!

- Ezra Pound
