The Chambered Nautilus

This is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign,
Sails the unshadowed main,
The venturous bark that flings
On the uncharted seas,
From storm and darkness free.

O better, then, for this
The great Goth builder of 
That is the heart of earth and made
The temple dome to the skies!
Read this as it shifts beheld! 

Here lies the sea-born, traced
Across the lands as waits a restless sigh.
Rise in the waters without his wishes.

Here's where I have come.
The spinning wheel is here, and there,
This alone can claim for it keeps, at bay,
All this rock and leaf, and struck wild on dry

By lightning in the forest and the face,
Of winds that drift through centuries and glades.

Each chambered nautilus has to home,
Built of seas and shadows sails.
Some savage shores coast free, but take
An utter sail, an absent mate, like me!

- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr
