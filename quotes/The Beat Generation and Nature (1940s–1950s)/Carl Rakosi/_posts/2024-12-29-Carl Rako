Listen, you can hear them  
      whisper  
         pulse  
                every  moment  
   coming alive in the breeze.
 
The mountains cradle,
feathered songs slither  
                        between branches,  
floating loose and down  
            with every thought  
     that moves in between  
                   kind words.  

Take the walk out there  
and find new forms,  
shattered by the thoughts
     you didn’t notice rising  
in the still air,  
owen down  
like honey dripping from
                             those quiet bees!

So come discover—
    let skies tend  
to your opened frames,  
it’s the time to breathe  
   along with   
       growing  
everywhere in movement,
everything makes sense,
                in every moment.
