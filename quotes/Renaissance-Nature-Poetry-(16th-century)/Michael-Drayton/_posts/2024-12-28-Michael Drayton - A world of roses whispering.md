A world of roses whispering,  
In gardenâ€™s depths where shadows creep,  
The fragrance of a thousand spring,  
Awakes my senses from their sleep;  

Each petal glistening like the dew,  
And blended with the golden morn,  
I lose myself, and think anew,  
Of happier days that once were born.

- Michael Drayton
