The Bushfire
In the heart of the bush where the sunlight meets flame,
A fury of nature, whose whispers claim fame.
The lionâ€™s roar echo, as the embers take flight,
Yet from ashes there rises the promise of light.
Oh, the dance of the blaze, fierce heart and bold breath,
Holds the life of the bush, as it faces its death.
Yet rebirth is timeless, in the cycle we see,
From the flames comes beauty, from the ashes flows free.

- Henry Lawson
