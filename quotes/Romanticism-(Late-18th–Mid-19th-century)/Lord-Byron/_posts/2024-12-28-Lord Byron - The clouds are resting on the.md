The clouds are resting on the hills,
The breezes play among the trees,
And the birds that sing in the quiet air,
Sing soft, like whispers, their melodies.

Upon the lake, the pale moon sheds a sheen,
With the waters calm as a desert’s dream,
As it stretches toward the distant land,
Swaying softly like a bubbling stream.

The silence holds in awe a voice,
That echoes in the depths around,
So quiet is the infinite world,
That with every breath joy shall abound.

In nature’s hand there lies a peace,
Of beautiful countenance forever young,
For here in nature’s arms we cease,
And all our fleeting cares are flung.

- Lord Byron
