In the beginning was the word,  
In the end is the rock.  
In the hourglass, a measured silence.   
Where the mountains rise   
are the words of flowering petals.

I see the scattered leaves   
after the storm.  
I see the rocks   
in the river's bend,  
pressing against me   
yet finding balance,  
carved by the water’s secret.
