shadows stretch like fingers over the frosted ground,
a chant of the wind dances with the fading light,
whispering secrets of the numberless stars."

Sky drawn low with lingering clouds,
shadows stretch like fingers over the frosted ground,
a chant of the wind dances with the fading light,
whispering secrets of the numberless stars.
