Listen—
The wind stirs softly,
Brushing past my cheek,
A secret only the trees know.
Fingers outstretched, I catch that touch,
A whisper of freedom and infinite space.

The horizon blushes at dusk,
Where colors bleed together,
And the night, a velvet cloak,
Wraps all in an embrace of twilight,
As the stars on watch unveil their light.


- Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
