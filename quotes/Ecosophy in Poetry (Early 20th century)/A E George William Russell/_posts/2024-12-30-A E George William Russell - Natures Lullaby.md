Nature’s Lullaby

The twilight falls in gentle grace,  
As the day bids soft adieu,  
And the night’s cool breath caresses  
Every leaf and every dew.  
Nature sings her lullaby,  
A gentle whisper in the breeze,  
Cradling the world to slumber  
In the embrace of ancient trees.

- A E George William Russell
