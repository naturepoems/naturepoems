The Fire

Sun and fire
In the sky's embrace;
As evening falls,
The light hushes itself
In deep wood,
Where the shadows breathe,
The trees recount
The secrets of fire.

All of us close
As dusk runs fast
Into deep night;
The embers glow,
A flicker of memories,
And the shadows whisper
The names of those gone.


- Judith Wright
