Oh, the flowers of the wood, oh, the trees of green!
Oh, the sun that glimmers on the golden stream!
For all the world is painted with a joyous gleam,
In every place where night may rule unseen.

And all the sounds of nature, the whisper of the leaves,
And flowers bending low in soft and gentle sighs,
Will fill the heart with beauty, as gold dust from the sky
Falls softly to the earth where all but dreams can leave.

- William Morris
