Bora Ring

To the place of the sacred, the silence,
Where the men dance their fierce dance,
Going round the ring,
The sound of the air turns
Like a shadow across the grass.

Here, the earth sings,
Each blade and stone alive,
Like the heart of a dreaming child,
A wind blowing heavy with the weight
Of memories and years.

A place of beginnings, of silence standing,
Where elders begin their songs,
Their laughter lifting beneath the stars,
In the cradle of the night, the ancient
Land remembers.


- Judith Wright
