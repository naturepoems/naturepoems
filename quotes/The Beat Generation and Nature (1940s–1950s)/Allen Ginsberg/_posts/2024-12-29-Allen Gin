The Fall of America

as I walk with you  
in the garden of nature’s  
beckoning,  
or beneath the denim blue,  
a gentle embrace of foliage,  
here is a song broke  
by laughter,  
a rush of light  
and color cascading,  
we bemoan the fall, yet in the air,  
these rhythms breathe and sing.

- Allen Ginsberg
