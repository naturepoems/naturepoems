As I"

author: Mina Loy
quote: "The little lines of the palm,
As I trace them,
Sing Nature's simplicity.
Her words skitter across the silence,
Words, shy with the gusts of clouds.
In the night's haunt, the trees whisper, 
"Life is beauty awakening,"
Roots gripping the undeclared earth.
Not dead soil, but genesis --
All colors aglow as dawn approaches."

The little lines of the palm,
As I trace them,
Sing Nature's simplicity.
Her words skitter across the silence,
Words, shy with the gusts of clouds.
In the night's haunt, the trees whisper, 
"Life is beauty awakening,"
Roots gripping the undeclared earth.
Not dead soil, but genesis --
All colors aglow as dawn approaches.

- Mina Loy
