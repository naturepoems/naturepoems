Morning Poem

Every morning 
you’re the first to know 
you’re sleeping, 
each light, the sun,
the sky and every blade of grass awaits, 
soft prayer and spring shines through 
shifts in the air—and let’s embrace it. 
The mornings revolve 
like clocks inside dreams. 
Start the dance—with faith, the heart—you and I. 
Each morning, we’ve done it again, 
a symphony returns, 
every flower opens, 
each bird a chorus; 
we please the universe 
so love does begin again,
resuscitation of color and sound, of clay and smile— 
you’re the first to know—you’re awake—
the universe waits for your song. 

Every morning 
let’s dance alive.


- Mary Oliver
