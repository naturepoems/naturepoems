Dissonance brews in the forest deep,  
    rustling secrets of ancient weeps.
   A brook murmurs in tangential jest,
      lizards leap through moments unguessed.
   Watch the shadows twist and merge,  
 each echo lost in a wild surge,
   where petals whisper of sun-kissed dreams,
    and every blade of grass silently screams.
