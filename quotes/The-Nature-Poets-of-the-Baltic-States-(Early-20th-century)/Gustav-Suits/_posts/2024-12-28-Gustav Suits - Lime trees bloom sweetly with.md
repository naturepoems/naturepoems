Lime trees bloom sweetly, with fragrance so light,
the dance of the petals in soft, warm twilight.
Evening descends, casting shadows in flight,
and stars start their twinkle, piercing the night.

The crickets sing ballads, while nightsâ€™ silken veil
covers the world in a gentle exhale.
In the hush of the dark, where dreams intertwine,
we find the pulse of the earth, so divine.


- Gustav Suits
