I walked the winding forest path,
Where sunlight filters through the green,
In every shade, the aftermath
Of seasons past, the unspoken glean.

The poppies burst in colors bright,
Amid thorns that guard their vibrant grace,
In every flower, there’s a fight,
A testament to nature's embrace.

The air is steeped in fragrant pine,
And echoes of the bird’s sweet song,
The world unfolds a design,
In every moment where I belong.

And here I pause, beneath the boughs,
To feel the breath of nature's sweep,
A whisper of the trees, a vow,
Where life finds peace, and spirits leap.

- Aleksandr Blok
