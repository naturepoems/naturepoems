The Dance
Under the willow’s
overhanging arms,
he danced with the breeze,
feeling the flutter
of the branches before they fell,
delighting in play
as he sang like a bird
drifting on white trails.
The circle wide now,
everyone lost but him
a sudden hush
followed by laughter.

- William Carlos Williams
