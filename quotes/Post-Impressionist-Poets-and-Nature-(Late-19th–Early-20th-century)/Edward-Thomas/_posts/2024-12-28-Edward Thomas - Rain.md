Rain
The rain at dusk on leaf and stone,
Each drop a rhythm soft and lone,
Awakens life beneath the earth,
A chorus of sleep, a simple birth.

From every cloud a tender call,
Beneath its weight, the woods enthrall,
And in dark woods where shadows glide,
The melody lingers deep inside.

- Edward Thomas
