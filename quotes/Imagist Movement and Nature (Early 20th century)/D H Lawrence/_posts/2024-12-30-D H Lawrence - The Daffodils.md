The Daffodils

   The daffodils are a laughing lot,
   with chin high they nod with intoxication,
   borne high upon the cotton air,
   affection shimmering with every breeze.

   They cup their cheer, in row upon row,
   with drunken dance, rapture in bloom,
   The light of gold that speaks new life,
   in gale, entangling the lavish hilt.


- D H Lawrence
