The Sea and the Skylark

As a wandering soul in the heaven
  to see with her lucid loveliness;
  She danced upon the waves, and from
  her mirror’s reach, implored serenity.

  Skylark, tell your tales
  of light viridian morning dew,
    with that only buoyant note of
  sweet ethereal bliss,
  where love and laughter intertwined—

In warm delight, I ride along,
  bestirred by sun’s bright bloom,
  Islows and real affection play
  within me far more.

Beneath the wide expansive skies,
  the bliss awakened tune and lark delight.

So vibrant the sea, the skylark’s flight.

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
