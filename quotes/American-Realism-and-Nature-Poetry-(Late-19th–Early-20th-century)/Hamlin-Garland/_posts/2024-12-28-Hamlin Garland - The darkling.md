The darkling thrush
I leant upon a coppice gate
When Frost was spectre-gray,
And winter's dregs made desolate
The white, unbroken land;
And, every heart did express,
The thought of God, and time, and chance.
Then I heard the thrush
Ay, throstle loud with a flute-like am
e.
To what was dead.
But the experience of life is solid, mad. 
And I made my way back to the tree; 
Endless night.

- Hamlin Garland
