The trees are down, they are not seen: 
Their silent tombs beneath the ground
Memorials of the grey and green
That covered all the land around.

Gone from the woodlands, landed here
Destroying many paths once drawn 
And now the beauty of the year
Is languid in a chill drab dawn.

The wind blows down the empty paths,  
The fallen trunks stretch cold and dry;
This beautiful, forgotten place 
Lies flat and empty underneath the sky.


- Philip Larkin
