Up the Stream

The sky was filled with the sunâ€™s golden sheen, 
As I floated along, without a care, serene, 
The soft murmur of the brook in my ear, 
Telling stories of nature, so crystal clear. 

I watched as the willows bowed to the flow, 
While dragonflies whirred in a bright, lively show, 
Each ripple, a dance, each wave, a delight, 
Inviting my spirit to break from its plight. 

In this moment of bliss, I was wild and free, 
Nature wrapped around me like a vibrant sea, 
And I promised to never forget when I roam, 
For a piece of this wild will always be home.

- Jack London
