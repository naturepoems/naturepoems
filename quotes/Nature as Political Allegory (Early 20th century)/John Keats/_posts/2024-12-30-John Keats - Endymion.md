A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
Its loveliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
So long as we are humans, a little worth.
For this, our true and steadfast friend, the sky,
Should be adorned with garlands, and bred to die.

That is our motto; that is where we would go,

- John Keats
