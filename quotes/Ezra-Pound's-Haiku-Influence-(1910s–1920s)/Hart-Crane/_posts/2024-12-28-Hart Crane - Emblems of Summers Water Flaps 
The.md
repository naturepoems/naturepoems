quote: "Emblems of Summer's Water Flaps, 
The Densure of the Sea Stare,
This constant Communique, 
Between the flutter of the sky's soft Measures,
A Serenade—but darkness roams , 
With thoughts of twilight’s rekindle—Timers do appear!"

Emblems of Summer's Water Flaps, 
The Densure of the Sea Stare,
This constant Communique, 
Between the flutter of the sky's soft Measures,
A Serenade—but darkness roams , 
With thoughts of twilight’s rekindle—Timers do appear!
