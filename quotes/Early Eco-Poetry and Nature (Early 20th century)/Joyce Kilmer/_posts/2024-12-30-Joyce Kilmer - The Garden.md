The Garden   
Men are glad enough to get  
A portion of the earth to till  
And ask no more of heaven,  
But I would for my garden take  
The wildness of the field,  
The rose, the fern, the honey-bee,  
And all that God has made.  
For nature is my truest friend  
And every green will do.

- Joyce Kilmer
