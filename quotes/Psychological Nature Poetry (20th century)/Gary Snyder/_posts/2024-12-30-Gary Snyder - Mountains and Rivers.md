Mountains and Rivers

In love, I carve the landscape
With the naked breaths of trees,
Between us, rivers mingle,
Cascading waters across
The granite faces of the ancients.
Wrapped around these particles,
Is the warmth of old stories,
Kissed by the winds of love,
Where shadows deepen,
And every heart opens wide.
From afar, the peaks watch over,
Connected by the flowing streams,
And I sculpt time with whispers,
As I carve my own true image,
In bond with their timeless stones,
Together, we sing anew.

- Gary Snyder
