Alastor; or, The Spirit of Solitude

I

The sun is setting, the moon doth glow,
And the dew is reclining on flower beds:
The becoming of nights that cooled the sparrows,
Crowned to the breath of the sun to soothe.

II

When dreams fill the ups and down of a void,
Like silent stars that drift through the night,
An echoing memory breaks my heart alone,
When the dew drops in joy slow starlit bright!

III

Like a sail of calm on the braving sea
That opens the gates, the skies won’t be free.
Dread the sound of throbbing hearts,
And music wends beyond the morning’s chart!

- Percy Bysshe Shelley
