The Dew

In silent morn, with sparkling light,  
The dew bestows a gift so bright;  
On blades of grass and petals fair,  
Nature's jewels, beyond compare.

Each droplet reflects a world anew,  
A mirror where all dreams come true;  
In morning's grace, they softly gleam,  
A fleeting moment, like a dream.

- Hartley Coleridge
