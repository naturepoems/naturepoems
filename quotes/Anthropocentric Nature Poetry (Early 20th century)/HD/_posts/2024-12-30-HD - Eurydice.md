Eurydice

O, how I long
for your touch!
For your kiss,
for loveâ€™s moments,
for the quiet
of our embrace.
I was guilty
of seeking
more than just memory,
more than this
small twisted pain
of flame.
O, how I long
for your touch,
how I ache to glide
from this darkened wood,
shining alone,
with the flowers;
that touch,
that tender, light
of a sun.
