Clouds hang low,
       heavy with musings,
awash in the delicateness of
    rain's whispered kiss;
         droplets gather—
   an orchestra of forms,
        jumbled and loose.

   Nature’s laughter,
      echoes in puddles,
     the world’s skewed reflection,
        a mirror, distorted.

- Max Ernst
