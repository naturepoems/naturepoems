Spring Blossoms

In the garden's breath of spring,
Life uncoils from winter's grasp,
Each bud a promise stirring,
In the warmth of sunlight's clasp.

Cherry blossoms blush and bloom,
Their petals rain like morning light,
As bees hum a busy tune,
In the joy of the season's flight.

The earth awakens with delight,
With colors bursting, rich and rare,
And fragrance fills the air tonight,
As nature dances everywhere.


- John Thompson
