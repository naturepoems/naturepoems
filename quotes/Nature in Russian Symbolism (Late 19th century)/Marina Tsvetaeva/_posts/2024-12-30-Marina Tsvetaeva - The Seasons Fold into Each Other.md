The seasons fold into each other,
As time flows like a wandering stream,
In Nature’s lap, I find forever,
The echoes of a sacred dream.
With every leaf that dances down,
And every flower’s fragrant sigh,
I come alive in all that’s fleeting,
In beauty that will never die.
So let me wander through the fields,
And savor moments soft and rare,
In nature’s arms, I’ll always be,
A part of love that fills the air.

- Marina Tsvetaeva
