Dancing Waves
On the shores where the wild waves crash,
Secrets of the ocean are unveiled,
In each tide's rise, a rhythmic flash,
Stories of love and loss are hailed.

Salt and spray weave the air so sweet,
Nature's heartbeat, a soothing balm,
In the dance of waves, our souls meet,
Finding solace, a perfect calm.

- Aasta Holth
