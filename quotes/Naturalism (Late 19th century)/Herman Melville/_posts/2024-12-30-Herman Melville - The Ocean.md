The Ocean—  
   
From a poet's solitary wanderings,  
We gaze upon the endless sea,  
Where waves in every hue are granted  
A voice that speaks eternity.  
  
The plaintive cry, the ocean's roar,  
It tells of the world's ancient tale—  
From depths unfathomed, evermore,  
In rhythmic splendor, we exhale.  
  
And ships that sail the venturous seas,  
With sails unfurled and spirits bold,  
In harmony ride on the breeze,  
Their stories in the tide retold.

- Herman Melville
