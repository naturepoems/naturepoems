The Sparrow

The efforts of the sparrow
   run like silent rivulets,
   flying where the sycamore shades,
   the sailor calls, where the horizon swirls.

   Each wing flap hammered into the air,
   lifts and any sill in the doorway,
   empty as a thought.
   The sparrow outlines depth,
   at its edge where naked things see the sky,
   it breathes a gilded ease.
