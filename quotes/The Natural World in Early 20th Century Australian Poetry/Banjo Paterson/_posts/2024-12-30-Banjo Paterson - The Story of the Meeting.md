The Story of the Meeting

When the sun drapes its warming rays,
A band of visitors came to say,
That the time for comforts to embrace,
Has come at last our land to sway.

As the trees hum with whispers sweet,
And across the brook, the meadow flowers rise;
Gather round, and hands join in sweet beat,
To tell tales of time as kind as skies!

Just listen close to the seasonsâ€™ tune,
As we echo songs to bend the ears;
And the rain that blesses us in noon,
Fills the cup and flows beyond the years.

So highlight in love of the bond you bear,
For the dreams we weave and remain,
In the company that one would share,
In the joy of the vast, we claim!

- Banjo Paterson
