We can only love what we see,
  The textures of the earth;
  The wind dances with the wildflower,
  And the sun plays games of shadow.
  Each ray brings a promise of soft smiles,
  Yet in this verdant confluence,
  I am small, but I am part of it,
  A heart beat within nature's calm embrace.

  - from "Love in Nature" (1923)

- Virginia Woolf
