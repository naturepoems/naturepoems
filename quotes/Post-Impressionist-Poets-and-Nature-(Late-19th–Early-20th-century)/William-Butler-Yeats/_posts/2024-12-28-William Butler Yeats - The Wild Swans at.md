The Wild Swans at Coole
The trees are in their autumn beauty,
The woodland paths are dry,
Under the October twilight the water
Mirrors a still sky;

Upon the brimming water among the stones
Are nine-and-fifty swans.
The vast swan, that is on the lake,
A mire among the silvered white, they are.

Their hearts have been shut much too long, and I,
With all my years and their tender grace,
Would give the world if I could, yet I know
That I walk forward as ages roll on.

Their sad, slow feet, did once startle the skies,
To rape this natural calm, their epic wings,
And the once frail elixir of liveliness,
Now wingless and weary falls unflair.

I am waiting in the trees by the lake,b
And I wonder now, would it be it more,
Had I only thought to be there with them,
That would wake me from honoring the snow?

- William Butler Yeats
