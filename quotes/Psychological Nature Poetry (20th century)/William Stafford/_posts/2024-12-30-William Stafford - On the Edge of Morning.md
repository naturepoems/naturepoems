I glimpse the horizon
  just beyond the fog,
       stretching endlessly;
     and it promises the world
then, on the edge of morning,
    while the dewdrops wait,
       life begins again.

   With every breath,
      we cling to the light,
        to the warmth in each blink.
Between shadows, the sun
   unfurls wordlessly
     dissolving worries,
     awakening the heart.


- William Stafford
