Sea Unicorn, 

Sea unicorn, into the blue
yet hidden in mystique, reveals
your life, purple weltering worth,
its delicate, priceless image,
like caps of white feathery lace.

Yet the whiteness is crackling,
turned toward fiery ravage and upheaval.
Will you permit me, sea-nymph,
full terms of spirit, full growth of air,
you—may I share your waters? 

Except a shilling, North Sea bouquet
I glance anchored along your ambush
and south to Archangel; finitely discerning—
your trajectories must ignite.

The hint of primal eyes, unrivaled,
leads to boiling currents unseen, 
hushed like red drops, wise as shadows!
Even now—be careful,
alone in the tempest.

Indeed warms; indeed integrate
all burgeoning bodies.
Thought the cavorters be many,
yellow sails of wake swathes.
The silence rolls on, therefore,
ius—truism leaves a scalier hulk,
a silence become alive.

Whereas indigo, amended of irony,
gathers, collects a stock
of discontent, shrouded like brown, vacant graves—
holding pearls beneath its chaste locks (
magical essence grim, void).

The tulips of desire echo,
there along, what love lives to consume,
awaiting profound potency assembled
by ready clouds to burst forth 
one after another.

The wait melds soft as a half wave, 
willing and intent like shrinking felt.
Hear all together, fields revolving—
the curve as the nerve of chose!
Onlookers glance west—mistakes wander in laughter
and grow truly sacred marginless.

Behold the grand abstraction!
To metaphors pulling wholly
however broken to you,
takes root to tap those leavening storms; 
i.e. care alone nothing provokes
your wealthy way to light like waters.

- Marianne Moore
