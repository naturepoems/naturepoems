The Shivering Trees
    In the dark, the last light,
    Made them trembling.
    All thoughts dispersed, lost with leaves.
    Out of the nature, the air darkens,
    Rising over shadows.

    I stand outside the landscape,
    Where the small black song is wrong,
    And look at that bright end.
    Do you remember the colors, the light?

- Randall Jarrell
