Rain Poem

Laughter drips from silver skeins,
Raveling the canvas of time,
Each droplet—an echo,
Of clouds shedding their voices,
The carousel of nature spins,
Dancing in puddles of reflection.

Every petal drinks, an idle thirst,
Each tree, a conductor, sways,
Ripples surge through the mirth,
Where small faces rise and sigh,
Leaves drink the prose of storms,
And nature writes its elegy.
