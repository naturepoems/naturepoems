A Morning Song

The sky is blue with timid light,
   The dew on every leaf does gleam;
From yonder hill the sun’s first might,
   The joyful world awakes from dream.

With just a breath of balmy air,
   The waking blooms release their fold;
In every garden, here and there,
   The flowers whisper secrets bold.

So let me rise with morning grace,
   And feel the warmth upon my cheek;
To inhale life’s fragrant pace,
   And revel in the joy I seek.

- Lizette Woodworth Reese
