Silent streams whisper softly,
each ripple, a story,
a lullaby sung by liquid hands,
the promise of life flowing
from mountain hearts to valleys.

I dip my fingers into
this cool embrace,
feeling the pulse of the world
as it journeys on,
while the trees nod,
gathering their own tales of longing
and roots planted deep.

- Margherita Guidacci
