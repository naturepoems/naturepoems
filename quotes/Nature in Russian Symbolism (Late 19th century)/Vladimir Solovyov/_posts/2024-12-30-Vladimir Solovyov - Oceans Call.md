The ocean waves, a roaring might,
In endless dance, both day and night;
With every crash upon the shore,
The spirit calls, forevermore.

In depths unknown, and tides that change,
Life ebbs and flows, yet feels so strange;
We listen hard to what they say,
In nature's heart, we find our way.

- Vladimir Solovyov
