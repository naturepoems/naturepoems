A Narrow Fellow in the Grass  
Occasionally rides—  
You may have met him—did you not  
His notice sudden is—  

The Grass divides as with a Comb,  
A spotted Serpent goes—  
And he rides—upon his Head—  
And when he leaves—he goes—  

The Grass is like a frightened beast—  
Leaping, and frighted flies—  
And he coils away within—  
And then he advances and  

He takes away your Breath—  
And look—the Grass is darkest green—  
And when it's gone—pale brown  

It looks most like a Leaf  
That by his Beard could spit  
It teased your sense that he might—  
Somehow—you might not meet!  


- Emily Dickinson
