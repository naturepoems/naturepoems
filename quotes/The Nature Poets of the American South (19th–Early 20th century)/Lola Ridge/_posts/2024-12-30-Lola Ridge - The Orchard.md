The Orchard

By the orchard’s edge I hear  
  The thrush and the quail,  
  I hear vast hearts moving  
 
Dreaming their gold,  
  anxious over sun-dried  
  loosened earth, sometimes high,  
 
Under low branches, with their dark leaves,  
  And how they cast together,  
  All those hands  
 
Of honey sealed suns  
  weaving in and out  
  Never say, parting leaves!  
 
Here, where they turn soft,  
  carving out wishes —  
  I sit where all yellow light sings sun,  
 
Under fibro boughs,  
  feeling there is strength.
