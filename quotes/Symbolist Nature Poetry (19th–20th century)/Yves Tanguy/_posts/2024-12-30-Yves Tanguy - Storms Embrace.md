Amidst the storm, where wild winds rage,  
The mountains stand like ancient guards,  
Their rugged strength a timeless page,  
Nature’s spirit, in whispered shards.

With every clash, a tale unwinds,  
Of roots that grip the earth below,  
In every gust, the heart combines,  
To nature’s tempest, we bow and know.


- Yves Tanguy
