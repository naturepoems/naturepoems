Ephemeral glimmers,
   sheer wicks glowing
   from my fingertips.
   Past worlds answer
   the sigh of ferns,
   with the urge
   to recreate dust,
   from cobwebs in the pine.
   We shall
   wear the forest’s veil,
   as we catch the lashing air
   in our mouths.
   The delicate spire
   shivers amidst cries.

- Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven
