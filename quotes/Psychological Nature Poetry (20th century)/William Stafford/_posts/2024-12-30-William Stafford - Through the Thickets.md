Wandering through the thickets,
   I heard the voice of the wind
      and felt the pulse beneath
the moss and leaves,
        shouting late autumn’s truth.

Each crackle of a twig
     painted the air
   with echoes of memory,
   where promises of spring
  seemed to linger—
       almost forgotten,
          hidden in silence.
