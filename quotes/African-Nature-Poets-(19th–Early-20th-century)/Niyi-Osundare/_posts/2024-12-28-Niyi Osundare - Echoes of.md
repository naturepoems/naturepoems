Echoes of Earth

Deep in the belly of the earth,
The drums of life throb,
Thumping with the rhythm
Of roots and rocks,
Of valleys and plains,
Of rain and drought.

Each echo, a promise,
Each silence, a story,
Buried beneath layers
Of time and memory,
The whispers of ancient kin
Beckoning through crack and crevice,
A legacy engraved in clay.

O sacred earth, my mother,
You cradle our tears
And hold our laughter,
At your bosom, we thrive,
Beneath your sustaining embrace,
We rise, we roam, we celebrate
The circle of life, evergreen and pure.
