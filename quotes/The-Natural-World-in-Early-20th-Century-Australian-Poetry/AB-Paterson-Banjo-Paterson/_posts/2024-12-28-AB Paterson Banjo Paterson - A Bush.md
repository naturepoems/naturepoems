A Bush Christening
The baby's laid--the hoss is tied,
They're all gathered 'round to hear,
The blessing of a bush priest,
And the joy of another year.

He'll bless the home, the hearth, the home,
Where the grass is green and wide,
And they all kneel on the soft earth,
For a bush christening, full of pride.

- AB Paterson Banjo Paterson
