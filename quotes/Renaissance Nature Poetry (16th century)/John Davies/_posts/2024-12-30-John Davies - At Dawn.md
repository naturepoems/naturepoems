At Dawn

With sunrise breaking every cloud,  
As light spills softly on the ground,  
The world awakens, singing loud,  
The notes of dawn, in chords abound.

O gentle morn, where dreams anew;  
The softest breath of day returns,  
In every hue that shines with dew,  
The heart ignites, the spirit burns.

At dawn, my soul is set to soar,  
As rays of hope break through the night;  
In nature's arms, forevermore,  
I find my peace, my own delight.

- John Davies
