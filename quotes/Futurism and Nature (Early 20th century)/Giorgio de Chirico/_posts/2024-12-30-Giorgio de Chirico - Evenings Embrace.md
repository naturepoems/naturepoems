Beneath the arches of the old trees, 
Time unfurls its subtle weave,
Each leaf a memory, each branch a thread,
In a tapestry of vibrant life.

The lakes mirror the azure sky,
Reflecting visions of eternity,
Where silence speaks louder than words,
And nature cradles the hushed moment.

Evening descends with a sultry glow,
Gold and amber hues blend and play,
Inviting hearts to wander freely,
In a world that awaits our embrace.

- Giorgio de Chirico
