The Wild Rose
Ask me no more, my love, for thee,
Than can the wild rose give.
For beauty, in ephemeral spree,
Does bloom as long as we live.

All scents that rise on summer morn,
A flicker, bloom, and fade away;
In petals soft of crimson worn,
Is whispered all I long to say.

And should you press the petals near,
And pull the thorns from broken womb,
My love shines through the silken cheer,
A gentle heart—forever bloom.

- Christina Rossetti
