Lament of the Night
The night drapes her shroud,
Opening her arms wide,
Offering hush and solace,
As the moon strides barefoot,
Scattering silver dreams
Across rugged earth,
While thoughts of dance linger.

We wander under shadows,
In the embrace of tender silence,
The pulse of the earth slows,
Revealing the soft heart that beats,
With the love of forgotten stars.

- Hugo Ball
