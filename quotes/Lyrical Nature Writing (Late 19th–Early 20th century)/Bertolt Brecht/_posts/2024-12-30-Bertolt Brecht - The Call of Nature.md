The Call of Nature

When the sun caresses the hills,
and the shadows stretch over the valleys,
the world exhales a sigh,
one that speaks through silence,
a language that connects us all.

In every breeze a whisper of longing,
a flight of wings playing tag with clouds,
at the river's edge, where thoughts find peace,
a sanctuary beneath ancient trees,
our souls kiss the earth.

So listen, dear friend,
for nature never stops speaking,
her tales rise in the morning fog,
a poetry of the everyday,
a reminder,
that we are always welcome,
within the cradle of her arms.

- Bertolt Brecht
