The lake reflects the sky’s embrace,  
A mirror of azure and clouds above;  
In this stillness, I find a sacred space,  
Where the spirit's song is a serenade of love.  

The fishermen cast their lines with care,  
While the ducks glide by on the shimmering sheen;  
Nature’s canvas offers its art so rare,  
In every ripple, in every scene.

- Ruth Dallas
