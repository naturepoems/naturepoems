What mystery veils the dew-laden morn,  
When the world awakens in soft hues?  
The garden breathes a sigh of relief,  
As butterflies dance in the mild sun,  
Each petal glistening with precious light.  
The air is thick with laughter and sighs,  
Nature unfolds her arms wide,  
In a lover's embrace of fragrant blooms,  
What joy to be a part of this woven spell.

- Jules Laforgue
