The Sun — just touched the Morning  
His Golden Hand laid low  
On the little Guide to tell me  
That the day would come — and go —  

As the birds began their singing  
And the dew-folds, open wide –  
In every path, and glade —  
Where twilight does abide —  

Such a gentle way to greet me  
When the skies are clear and true —  
And whispered through the flowered leaves  
The love I hold for you —

- Emily Dickinson
