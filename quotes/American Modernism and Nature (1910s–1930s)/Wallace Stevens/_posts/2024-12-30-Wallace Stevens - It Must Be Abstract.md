It Must Be Abstract

It must be abstract, this feeling.
Where is the brown bear in the falling leaves?
The wind creaks the empty branches, bit by bit,
As the trees shudder on their trunks.
I feel the unknown between here and the clouds,
Connecting all our minds on this autumn day.



- Wallace Stevens
