Moonlit Meadows  
Beneath the silver glow of a soft, watchful moon,  
The meadows awaken and hum their sweet tune;  
With the night creatures stirring, and dreams taking flight,  
In the hush of the twilight, 'til day turns to night.
 
The daisies lean gently, kissed by the breeze,  
While crickets serenade under whispering trees;  
The stars blink in laughter, like jewels in the dark,  
And the nightingale's call leaves a luminous mark.
 
So linger a moment, 'neath this tranquil embrace,  
For the moonlit meadows carry beauty and grace;  
In the stillness, the heart finds its rhythm anew,  
In the tapestry woven of nightâ€™s gentle hue.
