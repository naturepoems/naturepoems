The Ocean's Call
The waves unfold their rhythmic song,
a lullaby of depth and space,
with saline notes that pull me strong,
a wild embrace, a timeless grace.

Each crest and trough, a heartbeatâ€™s plea,
a dance of tides beneath the moon,
where dreams are spun and spirits flee,
a sailor's wish, an ancient tune.

Here on the shore, I find my balm,
where earth meets ocean, vast and free,
a tranquil fury, fierce yet calm,
the ocean's arms are home to me.


- Thomas S P S Munch
