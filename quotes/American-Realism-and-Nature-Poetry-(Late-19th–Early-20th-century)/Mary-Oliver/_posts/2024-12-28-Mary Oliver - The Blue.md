The Blue Bow

I have a great joy when I see the blue bow  under the trees  in the quiet place,  where the flowers bloom and shed their fragrance,  where the wind picks them up  and carries them into the sky.
And I think how fate connects us all,  and how joy, each fleeting into the air  and settles deep into our souls,  how meaning stands by  and sings softly,  when the heart opens  and is free.

- Mary Oliver
