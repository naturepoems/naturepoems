The summer rain is full of light,
And bathes the earth in soft delight;
The birds sing brighter on the wing,
And all around, the world feels spring.

Upon the woods the shadows dance,
As with the breezes all the flowers prance,
In every bloom and every ray,
There's magic held in every day.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
