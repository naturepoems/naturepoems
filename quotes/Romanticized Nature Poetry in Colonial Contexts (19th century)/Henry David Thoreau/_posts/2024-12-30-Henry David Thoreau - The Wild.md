The Wild
---

In the silence of the woods, I hear,
The wild call echoing near and clear,
Though the cities outshine with their lights,
The whispers of green, in soft-trembling nights.

Creatures wander in real, serene flight,
Filling their days with soft morning light,
I lose myself in this gentle domain,
Where courage lives, past the worldâ€™s vain.

---

Each leaf and branch bears stories old,
Speaking truths, in shades of gold.


- Henry David Thoreau
