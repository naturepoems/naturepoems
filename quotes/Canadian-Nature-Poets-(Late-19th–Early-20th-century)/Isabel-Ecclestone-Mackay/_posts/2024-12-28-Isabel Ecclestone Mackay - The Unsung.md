The Unsung Song

I heard a song one evening,  
In a whisper from the trees;  
It said that I had journeyed far,  
Through valleys, tides, and seas.  

And I thought, in all my wanderings,  
No voice has sung to me,  
Yet every part of nature sings,  
If only we could see.  

The fuge of wind, the dance of trees,  
The babbling brook’s soft call;  
The secrets wrapped in twilight hues,  
Are waiting one and all.  

So I listen when the breeze goes by,  
And cherish every tone;  
For in nature’s choir, my spirit hears,  
The song that is my own.
