As twilight descends, 
And the light begins to fade,  
The crickets serenade,  
A ballad of day’s parade,  
In a hushed embrace of time.

Here among the fading hue,  
Nature lays down to rest,  
In the stillness, life is blessed,  
And all that’s wild and true,  
Finds the heart’s eternal quest.


- George Ripley
