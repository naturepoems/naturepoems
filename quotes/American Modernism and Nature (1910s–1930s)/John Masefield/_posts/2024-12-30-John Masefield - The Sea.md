The ship's in the offing and the wind's in the rigging;  
In the glistening beam of the sun,  
I gaze from my porthole and gaze at the tide-waves,  
As the vessel sails on, so bold, so young.

I lean o'er the rail, and my heart is soft and tender,  
To where the sea's kiss meets the shore -  
For the ship's going with her crew to the distant splendour,  
As she whirls from the harbour, and leaves us no more.

- John Masefield
