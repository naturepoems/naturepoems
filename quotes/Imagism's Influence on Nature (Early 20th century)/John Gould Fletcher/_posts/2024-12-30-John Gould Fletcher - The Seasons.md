The Seasons
Spring clashes with winter's veils,

The fierce light lit upon a pale,

Leaving the bruised earth in greens,

Peeking through thawing shrouded screens.

Softness of life borders frailty's edge,

Every drop a ;witchcraft's pledge.

Summer's touch enfolds, warmth is near,

While autumn breathes with gentle fear.

Leaves whisper in wrinkling hues,

Turning to autumnâ€™s inevitable dues,

And winter holds stretch forth like a dream,

Frozen stillness is the only theme.

- John Gould Fletcher
