The Garden of Silence  
In a garden abandoned,  
Where the vines have grown wild  
Like tangled thoughts,  
The earth whispers in secrets,  
Each leaf a prayer,  
Resounding the stillness  
Of this vast cosmos.  

The flowers fade back  
Into shadows,  
Their brightness dimmed  
By the weight of the sun  
That varies its gazeâ€”  
And the bees wander  
Searching for sighs,  
For lost moments  
Of unbidden laughter.  

Here in this silence,  
Time cradles itself,  
The scent of the past  
Intertwining with the air,  
Where memories settle  
Like dust on old books,  
Each page opened gently  
By a wandering mind.

- David Gascoyne
