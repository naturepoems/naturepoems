The Dawn of Spring

In waking woods, the flowers arise,
The sunlit days begin to hum,
The sky, a canvas of blue skies,
Announces winter's harshness done.

The earth exclaims in vibrant hues,
As buds unfurl their tender grace,
The whisper of the morning dew
Awakens every slumbering place.

Upon the brook, the laughter flows,
As nature dons her emerald dress,
In harmony, the wild wind blows,
To sing of life in sweet caress.

- Clara Wadel
