A Spirit of Life

The night wind bears the faintest delights
Of all the woods, and the vast heights inspire 
As nothing can so light the shade as there
Where tread the essence, in deep joy unfold, 
And stillness dawns where laughter is odd;  
With every flower that whispers unfolds, 
And flutters a close to comfort thus—
For few may witness the fold at its will! 

— Percy Bysshe Shelley
