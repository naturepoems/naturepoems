Let the Light In

O, sun fill my soul once more,
    shine through the curtains,
The dawn is breaking as I watch,
The earth awakening,
Every blade of grass catching hope,
   joy simple and strong,
Nature's embrace whispers,
       ah, allow the light in,

Teach us to stand tall and proud,
    within every moment.
