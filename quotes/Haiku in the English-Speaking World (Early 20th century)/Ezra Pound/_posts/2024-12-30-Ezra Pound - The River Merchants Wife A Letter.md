The River Merchant's Wife: A Letter
While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
I played about the front gate, pulling flowers
You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,
You walked about my courtyard, pulling a red bird
With your blackened hands.

You would ride on my back
And I would play at being a boy
When you went away, you would vanish into the air
And I would watch you as you went
Down the road.

After a long time has passed,
When we are no longer boy and girl
And I think nothing of the years between us
And I see you ride again on a horse, my face
Will be pale and my hair will hang down my back
But my heart will still be at play.
This day when you left me,
The leaves were falling.


- Ezra Pound
