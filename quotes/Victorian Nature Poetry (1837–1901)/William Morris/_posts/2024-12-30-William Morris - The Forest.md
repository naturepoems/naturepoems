Through the woods and through the glades,
At evening when the sun was gone,
I heard the chirping of the blades
Of grass that reverberated on.

The mellow phantoms fled in flight,
And whispered as they moved away,
A soft wind stirred into the night
With dreams of distant summer day.

- William Morris
