In the silence
of this clear night,
your wings flutter high,
above silver moons,
so casting shadows,
touching all creatures
that share this moment.

The wood is alive,
a breathing entity;
voice calls to voice
to weave their worlds,
for each flower’s bloom,
each hum of the bell,
transports, through nimbly,
the sounds of earth.

Here I shall listen,
below this vast dome,
as the breeze stirs its wings,
while thoughts run wild
and free amongst the stars.
In the quiet,
a soft reverie slips free,
dancing upon those shadows,
where dreams take root.
