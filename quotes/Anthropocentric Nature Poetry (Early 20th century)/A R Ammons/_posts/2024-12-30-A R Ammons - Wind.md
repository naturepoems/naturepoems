Wind

The wind lifts everything,
  loosens the forms,
  a shift in the trees,
  the birds pause,
  and look skyward,
seeking the way through â€”
  they flutter, they curve,
  tracing old paths; 
the wind intertwines,
  in graces, with wings sober,
  with skies rushing,
like moments of time;
yet they launch,
  in grace as a thought
  rises in still air.

- A R Ammons
