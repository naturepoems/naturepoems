The dawn breaks softly in pastel hues, 
Awakens life with gentle cues.
With every ray, the bird renews, 
The silence of the night, now hues.

Among the blooms, the bees hum low,
Collecting nectar, nature’s glow.
In hidden corners, life does flow, 
A tapestry of life does show.

Here, every leaf has a tale to tell, 
Of sun and rain, of storm and swell.
In this embrace, my heart does dwell, 
For nature’s song is a sacred bell.

- Andrei Bely
