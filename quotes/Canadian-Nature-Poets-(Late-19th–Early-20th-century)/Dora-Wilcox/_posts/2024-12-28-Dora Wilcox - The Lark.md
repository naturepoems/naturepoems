The Lark Ascending
  
  With a silver voice the lark ascends,
  To greet the sun with joyful eyes;
  In skies of blue, her song transcends,
  And paints the dawn with sweet replies.
  
  She flits from bloom to bloom with glee,
  Upon the gentle morning’s breast;
  Through fields of gold, so wild and free,
  She weaves a tapestry of rest.
  
   Beneath the oak, where shadows play,
  Each note a ripple on the air;
  In pure delight, the heart will stay,
  As nature’s charm surrounds us there.
