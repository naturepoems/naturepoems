The sun is a vast candle
  Lighting the madness
  Over the world's head,
  The light a whisper
  On the tree, as it shakes,
  And on the water
  That holds it, trembles.
  I listen for the echoes,
  Of the last summer,
  The last far summer.
  I can taste the bitter dark,
  A moment before it comes.
  The sun is going to fall,
  And I will be waiting.

- Sylvia Plath
