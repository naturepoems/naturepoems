The Ingraham  
The azure skies, the sun-kissed hill,  
The mountains, crowned with summer green,  
A world of wood and of valley that still  
Binds life in beauty as a silver screen;  
O, rarest charm and wondrous joy,  
That nature paints in hues,  
As streams rush onward toward the sea,  
With glances of the Muse.

- Leigh Hunt
