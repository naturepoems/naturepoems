The sun breaks through the clouds,
a gentle reminder that light conquers darkness.
Each day is a canvas waiting to be painted,
with colours of hope,
brushed with the whispers of the wind.

As I step into the day,
with the earth beneath my feet,
I let the warmth of the sun
ignite the spark within me,
gifting me the strength to rise.

Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
