The Flower

Through the reeds and rushes I wander,
   Through the riverâ€™s flitting flow,
And the flowers give their sweet redemption,
   As a wreath to Heaven flows.
My soul is spread in the wonders,
   As the sun in the sky,
And I seek the ghosts of the shadow,
   Where the notes of delight sigh.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
