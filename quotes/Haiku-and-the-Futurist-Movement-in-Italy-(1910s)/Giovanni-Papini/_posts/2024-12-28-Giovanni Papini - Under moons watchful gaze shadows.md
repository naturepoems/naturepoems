As night’s fabric weaves dreams in silver threads.
Stars twinkle their secrets, a cosmic design,
Where all of existence in stillness spreads."

Under moon's watchful gaze, shadows entwine,
As night’s fabric weaves dreams in silver threads.
Stars twinkle their secrets, a cosmic design,
Where all of existence in stillness spreads.
