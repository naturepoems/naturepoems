Morning on the Hills

The morning light breaks bright and clear,  
   As sunbeams kiss the dew;  
Across the valleys, hazel trees,  
   And silver glades renew;  
The lark ascends through arcs of gold,  
   A melody on high;  
To which the breezes dance along,  
   And whisper sweet goodbye.  

â€“ Laurence Binyon
