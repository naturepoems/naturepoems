Landscape with the Fall of Icarus
According to Brueghel
when Icarus fell

it was spring.

A farmer was ploughing
his field. The whole

of his attention focused
on the harvest.

In the meantime

something was happening
in the sun.

Perhaps a boy
was drowning –

but the ploughman
saw something

farther ahead
at dusk –

only a ploughman
in twilight planting.


- William Carlos Williams
