The Song of the Chattahoochee

By Sidney Lanier

I
Above the river a sweeping bridge
      Spans the waters which flow to the sea,
And it calls to the river 'Take me with you
      As far as the waters may be.'

II
With a whirl and a rush, the river replies,
      'My answer is one â€” of our love!'
For with you I shall rest upon some of those shores,
      And sleep on the warmth of the sun above.'

- Sidney Lanier
