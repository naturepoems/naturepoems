What art thou, Nature? Take my hand and lead,
Into thy forest, hear the streams descend;
Beneath these branches, golden leaves, I heed
The secret song that flowers might send,

Each blossom cradles dreams of life untold;
Eternally we spiral through the air;
Conversation sweet as honeycomb and gold,
The fragrant notes of spring beyond compare.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
