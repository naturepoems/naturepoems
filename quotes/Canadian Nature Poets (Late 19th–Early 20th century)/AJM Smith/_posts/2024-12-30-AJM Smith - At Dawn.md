At Dawn

The world, it stirs, in twilight’s glow,
   A hymn of life, emerging light,
The sky awakens, orange, then blue,
   The start of day, dispelling night.

The birds rejoice; their song ascends,
   A symphony to greet the morn,
And in the soft embrace, the universe mends,
   As day emerges, hope is reborn.

The dew upon the grass, a soft caress,
   A precious gift from the night’s own grace,
At dawn, we find the gift of wilderness,
   In every ray, the world’s embrace.

- AJM Smith
