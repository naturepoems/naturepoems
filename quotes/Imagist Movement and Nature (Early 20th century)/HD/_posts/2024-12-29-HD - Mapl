Maple Leaves

In the dark shade, the whisper runs,
And dew drops like tears of birth,
Yet the essence of bloom remains,
Beneath boughs of ancient heavens.
Through the deepening night,
The curled edges of leaves gather,
In the circular dance of the ground,
Where the stillness listens.

Oh will there be
A whisper through the green;
In memories of harvest, 
The birth of songs,
Underneath the stars shed round.

â€” H.D. (Hilda Doolittle)
