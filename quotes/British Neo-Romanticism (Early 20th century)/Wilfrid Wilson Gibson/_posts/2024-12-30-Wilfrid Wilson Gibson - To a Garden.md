To a Garden

In dusky hours when daylight sighs,
With twilight fluttering in its flight;
You whisper songs to darkening skies,
As every leaf leaps into night.

Your blossoms steal the fading light,
In fragrant laughter all a-glow,
You dance with joy till stars shine bright,
In secret glades where night winds blow.

With violets dark in shadows deep,
And roses that blush in the haze,
You cradle quiet in gentle sleep,
And bind our hearts in your soft ways.

- Wilfrid Wilson Gibson
