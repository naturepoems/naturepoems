On a Summer’s Eve

Beneath the vast heavens, awash with the stars,
The earth breathes softly, unmasked by its scars,
In this quiet moment, as day bids goodbye,
The whispers of evening draw a sweet sigh.

Fireflies flicker, like gems in the dusk,
Painting the shadows with elegance husk,
While night crickets chirp in a rhythmic spree,
A tapestry woven by nature’s decree.

So rest here a while, in this solace divine,
Let the warmth of the twilight, converge with your spine,
For in summer's embrace, when the day meets the night,
The world is a canvas, a magical sight.
