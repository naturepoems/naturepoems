The Weedy Waste

Where daisies dance and violets sigh,
    And butterflies play mad,
The weedy waste is growing nigh,
    As draped by Nature clad.

O can you hear the call of spring,
    As fragrant flowers appear?
It is the joy that first takes wing
    And fills the heart with cheer.

- John Shaw Neilson
