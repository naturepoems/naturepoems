Winter's Silent Night
The world wrapped in blankets of white,
In winter's embrace, silent and deep,
The stars twinkle down with a shimmering light,
While nature holds all in its sleep.
The trees wear their cloaks, so still and bright,
In the shimmering glow of the moon's tranquil flight.

- Andrew Jackson Downing
