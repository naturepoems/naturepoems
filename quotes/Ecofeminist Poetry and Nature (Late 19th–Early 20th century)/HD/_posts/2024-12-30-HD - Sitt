Sitting on the Bank

I sit by the river,
  my feet in the cold.
The silence of the day
  rests on the blue
  burnished light,
while the shape of green
  drapes like a root.

What of the weeds scattered,
  across my path,
  torn wide with light—
with the shift of dusk,
  bent to down;
  it leans like a shadow now.

H.D.
