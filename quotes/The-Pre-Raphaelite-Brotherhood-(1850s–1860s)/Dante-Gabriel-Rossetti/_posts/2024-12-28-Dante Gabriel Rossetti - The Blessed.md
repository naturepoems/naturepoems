The Blessed Damozel

The blessed damozel leaned out    
Over the balustrade,    
    
Her yellow hair flowed down    
    
    
As she looked at the verdure and iridescence,    
And her eyes were hanging overhead,    
As a dove among gloom springs high;    
    
Both woodland and full stars grieved together.    
    
    
And she looked and felt sure of him;    
All around shone around winds,    
Along the trees with the gentle expressiveness;    
Into the shadow side waters.    


And in heaven her smile laughed,    
And all the ten thousand flowers thought    
    
They praised her in sweet space,  
Before rays glimmering star-touched  
    
Through shining autumn air.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
