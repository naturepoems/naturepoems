I see the softly falling snow,
   I watch the silver stars above;
I hear the whispers of the winds,
   They tell me all is peace and love.

The slumbering earth, all wrapped in white,
   A tranquil world both still and bright;
A canvas vast, serene and fair,
   A moment’s dream—a breath of air.

- Adelaide Anne Procter
