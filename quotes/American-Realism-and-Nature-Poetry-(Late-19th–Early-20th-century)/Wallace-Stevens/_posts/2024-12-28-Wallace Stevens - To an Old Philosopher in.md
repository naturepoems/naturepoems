To an Old Philosopher in Rome

Like a cornfield, that stretches out,
The thoughts he tries to capture,
To brand, and cherish and hold,
To the river’s essence always wandering.

The river glimmers, as he dreams
And the stone, within,
It is an echo of another time,
To illuminate what once was.

And I, too, hold dear the yellow leaves,
Wherever the sun ignites the senses,
And to this aging, endless light
—Beyond sight—now,
To think of nature now lies pure.

- Wallace Stevens
