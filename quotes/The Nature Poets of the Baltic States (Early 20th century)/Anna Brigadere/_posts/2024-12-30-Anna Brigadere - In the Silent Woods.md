The silent woods hold treasures untold,
In mossy carpets and shadows that play.
There, beauty lies still, serene and bold,
Inviting the heart to wander and stay.

Among the ferns and the whispering pine,
Life thrives in the quiet, the gentle, the shy.
Natureâ€™s embrace is a gift so divine,
In her secret sanctuary, dreams can fly.

- Anna Brigadere
