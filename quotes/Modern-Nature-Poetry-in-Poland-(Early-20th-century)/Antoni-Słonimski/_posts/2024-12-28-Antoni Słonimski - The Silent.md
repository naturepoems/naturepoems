The Silent Woods

Through woodlands dense, I wander free,
Where ancient trees in silence speak,
Whispers of life, beckoning me,
In their embrace, I am not weak.

A bird above sings notes of cheer,
The rustle of leaves, a soothing sound,
In this devotion, I find my sphere,
Linked heart to earth, in joy abound.

Nature's canvas, green and gold,
In shadows deep, the warmth I find,
Amidst the stories left untold,
I learn the language of the kind.
