The Sun

Oh! mighty sun, in the azure skies,  
Your golden rays, as soft as sighs;  
You caress the leaves with gentle breath,  
Awakening life, dispelling death.

The flowers bloom in your ardent glow,  
Each petal holds a story from long ago;  
You perfume the air with warmth untold,  
Under your gaze, the world becomes bold.

Dance, O sun, through your celestial dome,  
In the heart of the earth, we find our home;  
Illumine the darkness, sweet virgin light,  
In your sacred warmth, we conquer the night!

- Charles Baudelaire
