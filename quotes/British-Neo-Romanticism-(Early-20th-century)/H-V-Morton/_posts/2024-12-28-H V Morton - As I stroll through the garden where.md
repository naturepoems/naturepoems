As I stroll through the garden where the wild roses bloom,
In the sweetness of petals, I find the perfume.
Each fragrance a promise of the summer's embrace,
In the arms of the blossoms, there’s a heavenly grace.

The boughs heavy laden, the bees hover near,
In the warmth of the sunlight, the world feels so clear.
With each rustle of leaves, I’m reminded of time,
In the flow of creation, our spirits do climb.

The bees dance in rhythms, with nature as guide,
In the hum of their purpose, I watch with much pride.
For the dance of the seasons brings life to the earth,
In the cycle of beauty, find love in rebirth.

So sip from the essence of this garden divine,
Where time stands suspended and the stars brightly shine.
In the joy of the moment, let your heart be released,
For in nature's pure wonder, our souls are at peace.

- H V Morton
