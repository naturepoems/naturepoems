Walk with me in the shadow,
  Listen to the quiet sigh,
      The earth unearths her secrets,
Breathe with the trees,
  Underneath their wise canopy,
      Feel the pulse of life.

The rustle of leaves,
  The call of the unseen,
      Together we blend,
A melody unanswered,
  Vibrating through the threads,
      Binding all creations,
One song, one heartbeat,
  An ancient moment.

                          - From "In the Shadow"
