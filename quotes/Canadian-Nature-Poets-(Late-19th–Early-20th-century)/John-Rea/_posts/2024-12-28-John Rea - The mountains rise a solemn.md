The mountains rise, a solemn guard,
Against the azure skies so bright,
Their ruggedness, both proud and scarred,
A testament to nature's might.

With every breeze that sweeps the vale,
And every shadow that they cast,
A story shared, a whispered tale,
Of ancient worlds, from first to last.

- John Rea
