author: Futurist Poet
quote: "In the chaos dances the dandelion bold,
A splash of gold in the stories told.
Wind carries whispers, and laughter bursts,
In the folds of the earth, creation thirsts.

Sunlight scatters across leafy greens,
Brush strokes of life on uncharted scenes.
The universe spins in an endless waltz,
Nature and art in their sublime vaults."

In the chaos dances the dandelion bold,
A splash of gold in the stories told.
Wind carries whispers, and laughter bursts,
In the folds of the earth, creation thirsts.

Sunlight scatters across leafy greens,
Brush strokes of life on uncharted scenes.
The universe spins in an endless waltz,
Nature and art in their sublime vaults.

- Futurist Poet
