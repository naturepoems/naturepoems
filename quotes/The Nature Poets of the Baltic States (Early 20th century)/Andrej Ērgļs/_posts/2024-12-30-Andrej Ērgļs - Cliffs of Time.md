Upon the cliffs, where seagulls cry,  
And waves collide with rocky shores,  
The winds of fate, they dance and fly,  
A song of freedom that endures.

The ocean’s pulse, a timeless song,  
Echoes of ancients lost at sea,  
Each tide a memory belongs,  
A reminder of what’s meant to be.

In this expanse where dreams take flight,  
Nature whispers tales anew,  
Of journeys far, of love and light,  
Every heartbeat, a clue to pursue.

- Andrej Ērgļs
