The Rock

The rock is form,
The rock is nature,
The rock is summer noon.
Let stone swim and wait
For its bed quietly.

No granite here,
No dimension left or right,
Just the sunâ€™s direct view,
As stars drift through sleep,
Above on horizon far,
And then clear from our gaze.
                                 


- Wallace Stevens
