I found a little flower,
A wondrous thing, alone,
Beneath the shady bower,
Its colors softly shone.

It swayed with nature’s movement,
From dew drop to the sun,
In every moment spent,
Its beauty had begun.

A simple, sweet endeavor,
A reminder of the day,
How nature’s gifts, forever,
Can fill our hearts with play.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
