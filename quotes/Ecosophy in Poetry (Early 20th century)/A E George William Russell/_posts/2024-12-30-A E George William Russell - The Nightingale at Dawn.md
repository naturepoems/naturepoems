The Nightingale at Dawn

I heard a nightingale  
Sing from the depths of the gloom,  
Her song a silver thread  
Woven through the morningâ€™s bloom.  
As dawn cast away the night  
With its soft, gentle light,  
I felt in the utter stillness,  
A new world springing bright.

The dew on the blades glistened,  
The flowers lifted their heads,  
And the earth in her gladness  
Awoke from her silent beds.

- A E George William Russell
