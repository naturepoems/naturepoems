Storm clouds gather,  
a tense sky ready to weep,  
a prelude to chaos  
in the symphony of nature.  
Thunder rumbles,  
a distant heartbeat,  
audible echoes  
of the earth's raw power.  

Raindrops fall,  
a thousand tiny drums,  
beating on leaves,  
a ritual of renewal,  
a cleansing of the soul,  
dancing in the tempest.

- Gino Bartali
