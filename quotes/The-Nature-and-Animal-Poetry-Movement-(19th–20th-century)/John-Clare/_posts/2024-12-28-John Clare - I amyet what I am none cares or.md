---

I am—yet what I am none cares or knows;
My friends forsake me like a memory lost;
I am the self-consumer of my woes—
They rise and vanish in oblivion’s host,
Like shadows in love’s frenzied stoush  
As a thoughts, a dream, a mist, a vapor thin.
Action?  No! I’m more a ghost  
Whose spirit never cheered a heart or soul—  
Even in those dreams of fancy’s bliss.

Doomed to silence, and eternal distance.  
Each morning’s dawn, the fruit of the vine:
A sadness, a sorrow, the dew’s lonesome kiss—  
I must abide; reminiscent winds entwine
With memories morose—yet sweetly resign
Me to my fate as I forfeit my day’s glow.  
Yet not forever ends—forever departs  
The beauty, the bloom, the honeyed delight
That nature weaves in her tender night.

Lose me in a rippling brook or running stream,  
Then I may, perhaps, in foamy waves, dream;
Like hillsides that guard with a gentle embrace,
Her green, her weave—my only solace.
— In Nature’s arms lie the seeds of me.

— John Clare
