The Seasons,
   by Charlotte Smith

How far the falling leaves have burst apart,  
Now where the blooms are worn with wane;  
As winter winds have struck their deepened heart,  
In shades of gloom the autumn's now the bane.  

Fields of snow and shadows wild traverse,  
Tracing lost echoes sting;  
Yet Nature calls, makes rich and sweet her verse,  
To cherish all the hopes that spring will bring.

- Charlotte Smith
