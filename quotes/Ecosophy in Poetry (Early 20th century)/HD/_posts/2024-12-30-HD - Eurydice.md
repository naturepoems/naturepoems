Eurydice

   O wind, %
      I know your shivering ghost, %
         Waiting, %
      the singing, the falling, the whispering, flees; %
   O wind, %
      I hear you %
      planning and planting,
      the grey of your root — %
   O wind, %
      I see your stripped, your wounded hand, %
      and the dry, grey air %
      wasted and bare; %
   O wind, %
      I feel you bend my brow,—%
