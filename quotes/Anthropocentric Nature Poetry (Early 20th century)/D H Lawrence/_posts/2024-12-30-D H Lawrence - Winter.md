Winter

The world draped in a blanket of white,
Crisp and still, as if holding its breath,
The trees, stark and quiet,
Stand guard over a silent realm,
Each flake that falls a world unto itself,
A fleeting moment of perfect beauty,
Whispers of warmth hidden within the cold.

And I tread softly,
Hearing the crunch beneath my feet,
Listening to the sighs of the earth,
As it rests and rejuvenates,
In this sacred hush of winter,
I find the shadows of my heart,
In the stillness, the embrace
Of this dormant beauty, this peace.

- D H Lawrence
