The forest hums,
a reverberation of life,
a gathering of spirits that
whisper in the air,

Each path winding,
each step a journey,
a labyrinth of trees
that hold centuries
in their arms.

And as shadows play,
shimmering between leaves,
the heart finds peace
among whispers of
the wild.

- Ted Berrigan
