I stroll, where rivulets dash and flow,
And lilies offer their fragrant gaze;
The whispering wind that echoes low,
Calls to my heart in Nature's praise.

The silver brook sings sweet and clear;
The violets bloom, as if to cheer;
In forests green ‘neath skies that bless,
I find my soul in Nature’s rest.

- Joyce Kilmer
