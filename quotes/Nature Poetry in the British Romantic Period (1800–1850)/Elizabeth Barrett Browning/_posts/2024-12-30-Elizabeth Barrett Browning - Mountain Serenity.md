A mountain, from a valley’s gloom,
Stands high, where winds of fortune sweep;
From rocky heights to silver deep,
It looks, to see how flowers bloom.

The streams, like thoughts, run free,
Caressing every rock and tree.
The birds, in joyous flight they soar,
Nature’s music, forevermore.

Beneath the green or in the shade,
Where shadows dance, and sunbeams fade,
The breath of life is felt anew,
A gentle touch, in crystal dew.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
