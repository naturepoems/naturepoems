The River

The river flows with a sigh,
In the quiet of the morning,
Whispering tales of the past,
As it winds through valleys and hills,
A restless spirit, free and wild,
Dancing to the cadence of the earth,
Where silence meets the song of nature.

Upon its banks, I find solace,
In the gentle ripples and reflections,
Each moment a reminder,
That lifeâ€™s journey meanders,
With twists and turns,
Bringing me closer to the depths,
Of my own heart.

Oh river, guide me with your currents,
Teach me the language of flow,
In your embrace, I find my path,
Winding through the unpredictability,
Of this beautiful existence, of being, of love.

- D H Lawrence
