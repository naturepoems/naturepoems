The mountains hold their heads on high,
Embracing clouds in cool delight,
While tender rays of sunset die
And yield the world to coming night.

O Nature! I shall always roam
In this sweet haven filled with love;
For every journey leads me home,
To feel your beauty from above.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
