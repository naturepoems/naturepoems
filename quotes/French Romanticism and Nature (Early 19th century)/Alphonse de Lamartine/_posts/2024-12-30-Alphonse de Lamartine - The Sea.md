The Sea

Distant, grand, the ocean roars,  
In tumult green, with mighty scores;  
A symphony of crashing waves,  
Unfolding tales of sailors’ graves.

On shore, the pebbles, smooth and round,  
In salty air, memories abound;  
This primal force that shapes the land,  
Calls forth the dreamer’s guiding hand.

O endless blue, with mysteries deep,  
In your embrace shall all souls sleep;  
From shore to shore, in soft retreat,  
You whisper to the heart, so sweet.

- Alphonse de Lamartine
