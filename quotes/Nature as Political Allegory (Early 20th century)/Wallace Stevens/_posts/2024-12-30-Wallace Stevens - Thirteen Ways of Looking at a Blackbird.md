Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird

I
Among twenty snowy mountains,
  The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.

II
I was of three minds,
  Like a tree
In which there are three blackbirds.

III
The blackbird whistling
  Or just after.

IV
I can't tell you how much I want to be heard.
  I can't tell you
How much I want to die.

V
Between the figure of speech
  And the reality of nature,
We found our true purposes.

VI
The blackbird with its voice
  Escaping the act,
Whispering through branches.

VII
A shadow of thought falling
  Between the creature's song
And stones at my feet.

VIII
I was under the trees
  And I heard the blackbirds.
Now they are already gone.

IX
The blackbird singing
  Until the light
Has emptied itself of memory.

X
And all the trees are silent,
  Why do I hear
The absence echoing in me?

XI
If you listen to beauty, you may hear
  Nature around you, raucous yet serene,
And maybe feel your childhood stretched.

XII
Therefore, with open heart,
  Trust a blackbird
For all these nights to come.

XIII
A blackbird sings above
  The landscape where
An old worry lies down to sleep.
