So sun goes low,  
With enchantments that splendour a horizon,  
This path I trod — leaving its warmth  
To tell thee back, alas!  
It takes a turn, quiet pond  
Claiming each step to pay the eye from glory—  
Hurries no knot, no wall— destructive light!  

A dove be quickened bare,  
With flight returned—allowing my groundless pause—  
Hoard body’s soft renewal—  
The smallness enters spaces fleet:  
So far ye swallow, surrounded;  

Then a slow line  
When your distance folks abide;  
For all root still teems!  
In sun or winter’s barefoot weave,  
It leaves with hands unseen.  

And wonders on beds  
Tell no sigh, but can glimmer by this way;  
Through stretch and robe—a veil,  
When calm espouses faith for unharmed hearts,  
Sun’s glow follows the shore!

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
