Oh, for the time to sit and seek  
The secret songs that rivers speak,  
To feel the pulse of nature's heart  
In every word and every part.  
The dance of leaves on whispering air,  
The scent of blooms, the twilight fair;  
In every breath, the world anew,  
A poem penned by skies of blue.

- Bessy H Elliott
