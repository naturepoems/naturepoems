Silent Rivers

In the hushed embrace of trees,
where whispers of water weave through,
I find the quiet song of nature,
its gentle pulse matching my own.

Moss-covered stones cradle time,
it gathers like leaves in autumn,
huddled against the chill,
a timeless warmth beneath us.

Beneath the surface, life teems,
each ripple holds a secret,
each current a history of whispers,
where stillness points to movement.


- María Pizarro
