Clouds drift across the sky,
like thoughts against quiet memories,
yellow ochre dunes rise in defiance
of time and space,
whispering secrets of butte and mesa
with the wind’s embrace.

The landscape tells tales
of struggle and of dreaming,
of distant thunder's rumbling
and of the rain that comes,
a nurturing caress setting down roots,
this thirst will be quenched anew.

- Nadine Gordimer
