Upon the hills of green,
Where silence gently breathes,
The trees stand tall,
Guardians of secret wonders.

With roots deep in the earth,
And branches stretching wide,
They tell the tales of time,
In whispers, they confide.

Among the dancing leaves,
The breeze carries the song,
Of nature’s endless loop,
Where we all belong.

- JP Clark-Bekederemo
