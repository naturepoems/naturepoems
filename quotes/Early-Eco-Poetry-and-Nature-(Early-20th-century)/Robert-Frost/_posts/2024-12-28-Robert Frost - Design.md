Design
I found a dimpled spider, fat and white,
On a white heal-all, holding up a moth
Like a white piece of rigid satin clothâ€”
As if the prey were made of sugar icing.
Now the spider sits, with its balled head
On the flower from the hunting of the dead.
If design governs all things, then who would not rise?
Everything taken as it is, piece by piece
Must speak to the American landscape's lost souls.

The white burlap of the dead remain silent,
And thus the designs of light that seems heaven sent.
But the motion unfurling from above
Would whip all things into a suffocating silence.

Balance does not bear the fear of death,
But nourishes one with lively thoughts of madness.
Spiders wait for death until they are free
And then eat themselves up with all of the living roses.  
The witches come to point out the design,
And we all sigh under the silver ads.

- Robert Frost
