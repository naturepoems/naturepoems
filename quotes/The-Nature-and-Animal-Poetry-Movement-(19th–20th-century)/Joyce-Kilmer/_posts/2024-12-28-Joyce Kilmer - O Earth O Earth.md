O Earth, O Earth, return!
Art thou not a cup of fire,
A moving ocean of delight,
Where suns go down, and yet desire
Dulls not the day nor dims the night?

A diamond set in purple, 
A sapphire amidst the green
Catch on the winds and bursts from the shadows,
A thousand tongues for tongues unseen!

- Joyce Kilmer
