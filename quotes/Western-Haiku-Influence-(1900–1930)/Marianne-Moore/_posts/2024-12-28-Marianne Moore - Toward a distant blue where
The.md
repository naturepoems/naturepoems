quote: "Toward a distant blue, where
The horizon holds the dark
Of lightest shades of sanguine—
Insects swarm on petal-tipped
And sun-filtered wings, spiraling
Through the garden’s cool dawn."

Toward a distant blue, where
The horizon holds the dark
Of lightest shades of sanguine—
Insects swarm on petal-tipped
And sun-filtered wings, spiraling
Through the garden’s cool dawn.
