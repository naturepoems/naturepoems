The Cloud

I am the daughter of Earth and Water,
And the nursling of the Sky;
I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores;
I change, but I cannot die.

For after the rain when with vain repentance,
I get the sun put up in a pleasing way;
I go round the world with a little song to say:
I am the little cloud that scarcely sleeps!

I can wrap the Earth in clouds.
Shrouded in a distant haze
I will cover the Earth with a greenish silk
And adorn the brightened page.

I am not dead—I am alive,
I am just enfolded in grays;
And when I pass through the sky I find
I am in one with all my immense haunts.

The blue I hear sang with each storm,
And when the light cast itself
Through thy eyes upon the sea;
I will rest my heart under the gates of peace;—
In a gentle voice prepare to play!

- Percy Bysshe Shelley
