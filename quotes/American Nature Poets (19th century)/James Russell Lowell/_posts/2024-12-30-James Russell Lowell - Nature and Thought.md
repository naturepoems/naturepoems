Nature and Thought

Alone in the hush of the trees,
  While the pine boughs sway,
We hear the world breathe with ease,
  Cast the shadows away.

Echoes whisper from realms unseen,
  Each nuance winds through,
O, vast is the grace where we glean
  In lifeâ€™s dance to renew.

With each moment of gentle light,
  Nature awakens anew,
A soundless sigh fills the growing night,
  While the starlit skies grew.

So lend the heart to knowledge warm,
  In the expansive air,
And let every mind take form,
  Mere nature shows us care.

- James Russell Lowell
