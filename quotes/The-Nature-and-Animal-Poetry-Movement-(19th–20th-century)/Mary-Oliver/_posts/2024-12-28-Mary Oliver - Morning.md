Morning Poem
Every morning
I walk out into the world
and I look around,
a little entry—I mean>
I want to hear what all the creatures
speak to me.
I do not want to miss anything,
no matter what it is.
I want to hold a few stars,
a few flowers,
maybe a blade of grass;
I want to watch the ground,
each step a humble gift,
wherever I go,
I take little bits of light
and energy, surely,
every where I go.
This is a gift of my heart—
still every morning I do not forget
to feel the sun on my face,
or the dampness of the dew.
For these simple things, I will pray—
I will look and listen.
Whatever the name of the day,
it is odd that it is still here—
these things, these moments—
they gather around, like a drizzle, like a cloud,
and I am everywhere.

- Mary Oliver
