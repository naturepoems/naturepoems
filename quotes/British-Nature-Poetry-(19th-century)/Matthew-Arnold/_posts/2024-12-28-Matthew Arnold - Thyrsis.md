Thyrsis

In the smooth meadows beside the brook,
On flowery banks, and among shady nooks,
Where seen alone by all that blooms about,
I walked with you and ones who are without.

And there, among the larks and sparrows near,
Where summer sounds of joy flow clear,
A broken road shines faintly through the wood,
And down by it we played where they stood.

The trees around send scents anew,
The endless notes of wings in the fluorescent blue.
The lark profound sings clear and sweet,
For ever and ever, it floats with beat.

Cloud over me with romance bright and whole;
This gentle spirit binds soul to soul,
Thy laughter rings like harmony free:
The best of natureâ€™s beauty flows through thee.

- Matthew Arnold
