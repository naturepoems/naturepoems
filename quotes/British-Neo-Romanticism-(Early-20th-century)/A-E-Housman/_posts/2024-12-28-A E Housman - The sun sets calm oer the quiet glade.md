The sun sets calm o’er the quiet glade,  
The stars will soon be out to play;  
Night’s gentle arms, a sweet serenade,  
Bring forth a world where the lost may stray.

I sit by the brook, with thoughts so deep,  
The rustle of leaves, the whisper of trees;  
In nature’s calm, my heart won’t weep,  
For beauty is all that the night can seize.

- A E Housman
