The Garden's Joy  
In every bloom, a story told,  
In every leaf, a touch of gold;  
The fragrance sweet, the colors bright,  
A garden filled with pure delight.  

The bees at work, the butterflies,  
Dance through the air, beneath the skies;  
And nature smiles, a secret glade,  
Where peace and beauty never fade.
