In the heart of the woods,
Where silence breathes life,
Every leaf tells a secret,
And every branch holds a treasure—
In the dim light,
Where shadows dance and linger.

The moss holds ancient whispers,
While the brook sings sweetly,
A lullaby for the earth,
And the air is fragrant with tales,
Of wanderers who’ve come before.


- Louise Bogan
