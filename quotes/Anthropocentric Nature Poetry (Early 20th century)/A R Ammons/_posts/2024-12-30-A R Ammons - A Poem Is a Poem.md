A Poem Is a Poem

A poem is a poem
  because it is.
But there was a time
  when it had no name,
when it was a branch,
  or a stone,
  or a thief,
  or a mere
  2:00 AM concern.
Now, just like that,
  it has arrived,
jumping over a fence,
  bursting through the door,
  and asking for a place to stay.
It opens windows,
  and closes doors,
  leaves footprints,
  and builds fires.
It touches bones,
  and raises spirits.
It stirs up ghosts,
  and supports the living.
It is;
  it isn't; it can't be;
but it is; it is; it is.

- A R Ammons
