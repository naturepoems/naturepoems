The cool expanse of the ocean stretches wide,
Embracing the horizon, a tranquil tide;
Whispers of the wind dance on the waves,
A symphony of secrets the sea behaves.

Salty breezes tug at my heart,
In this endless realm, I find my part,
Each ripple a story, each crest a sigh,
Nature's deep movement, a lullaby.


- Henry James
