To One In Paradise

I found a place where the wild things grow,
Where swift birds trace the difficult land,
And the everlasting darkness starts to glow
In the nerve and vein of that loving strand.

Underfoot, unseen, life waits to show
The dewed paths written upon the strand,
When I am but a traveler in shadow.
I trod on the grassâ€”by-thoughts out of hand.

And reaching out, I swept the sky to glimpse  
Some corner of tomorrow, golden-tinged.
Beyond the grasping waves of earth, I left  
My footprints hidden by a moonlit fringe.

Is this the wisdom, from where we sing,
Lightened by this transient life I bring?


- Edna St Vincent Millay
