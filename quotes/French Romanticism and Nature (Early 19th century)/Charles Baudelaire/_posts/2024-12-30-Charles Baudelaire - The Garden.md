The Garden

A garden lush, where the wild ones roam,  
A secret place, where no heart is alone;  
In tangled vines the emerald lies,  
Lifting its head to the achingly blue skies.

With magic breezes, soft petals sway,  
Each flower a dream that’s lost in the fray;  
Stars bloom in the night amongst shadows cast,  
This sanctuary whispers stories from the past.

To dwell among lilies, where sweet songs are spun,  
A fleeting escape, beneath the golden sun;  
For in every leaf, and every high branch,  
A vivid testament to life’s endless dance!

- Charles Baudelaire
