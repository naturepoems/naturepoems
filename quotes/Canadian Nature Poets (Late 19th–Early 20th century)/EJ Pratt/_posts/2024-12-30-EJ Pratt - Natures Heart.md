Nature’s Heart  
  
  
In wild array, where mountains rise,  
And rivers carve the ancient ground,  
In every leaf, in every sigh,  
The heart of nature can be found.  
  
Across the vale, where shadows play,  
Where sunlit meadows stretch their reach,  
The whispering winds, they sing and say,  
In nature's heart, there lies a speech.  
  
So let me drift on nature's breath,  
As rivers run and seasons change,  
For every moment leads to death,  
Yet every soul in nature's range.

- EJ Pratt
