In the wild woods so green, where the shadows extend,
Thereâ€™s a whisper of life that will often descend;
As the stillness awakens with the call of the dawn,
And the creatures return to their solace and song.

For the heart of the forest, like the depths of the sea,
Is a haven for dreaming, where the spirit flies free;
In the peace of the wild, let our hearts take their flight,
For the essence of nature brings us pure delight.


- C J Dennis
