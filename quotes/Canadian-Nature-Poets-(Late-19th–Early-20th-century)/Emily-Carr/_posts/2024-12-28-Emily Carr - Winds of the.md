Winds of the mountains,
Rushing and sweeping,
Rippling the currents
Of cedar and pine,
Hearing the russet,
Hearing the tremble,
A frenzy of feelings
Of nature divine.

Beneath the loud laughter
Of streams that are racing,
Within the soft petals
Of blooms by the sea,
I feel the great pulse
Of life’s endless beating,
In every rough contour,
In the heart's gentle plea.

- Emily Carr
