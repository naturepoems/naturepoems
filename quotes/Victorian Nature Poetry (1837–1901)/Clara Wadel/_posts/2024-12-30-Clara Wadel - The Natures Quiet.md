The Nature’s Quiet

In rustling leaves, the hush of day,
A symphony of softest sounds,
In nature's breath, we find our way,
As peace envelops all the grounds.

The gentle brook, it babbles low,
The petals drop, a fragrant sigh,
In every moment, rhythms flow,
As time cascades, we learn to fly.

So seek the quiet in the wild,
In nature's arms, let worries cease,
For every heart—both soft and mild,
Finds solace here, in whispers, peace.

- Clara Wadel
