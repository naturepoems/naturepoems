Beneath the soil,
a secret life hums,
a pulse of existence
that thrives in darkness,
waiting for spring
to awaken its hopes.
A dance of roots,
a ballet unseen,
where life intertwines
in both joy and necessity,
every creature,
every seed,
era of potential,
a symphony composed
in solitudeâ€™s embrace.
