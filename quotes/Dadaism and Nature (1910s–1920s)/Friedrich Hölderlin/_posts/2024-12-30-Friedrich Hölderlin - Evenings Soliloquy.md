The evening sun, a burning orb,  
Sinks low beneath the tranquil wood,  
Where shadows merge, and silence stabs,  
A world retreating, misunderstood.
  
In that stillness, peace enfolds,  
Crickets serenade the night,  
And dreams take flight on whispered winds  
Beneath the stars' eternal light.


- Friedrich Hölderlin
