The Cycle of the Seasons

Spring arrives with tender grace,
A blush of blooms adorns the land,
Hope awakens, life renews,
In each bud, a promise grand.

Summer paints the world in gold,
With sun-kissed days and starlit nights,
In laughterâ€™s echo, joy unfolds,
As warmth wraps all in gentle light.

Then comes the fall, a stage set right,
With colors bold, a fiery dance,
Leaves swirling down in crisp delight,
Nature takes her last romance.

Winter, silent, cloaked in white,
A stillness hangs, the world asleep,
Yet in this quiet, life prepares,
For spring to wake, the cycle deep.

- Torrenti Orazio
