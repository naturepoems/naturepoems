The Spring Awakening

As winter melts to spring anew,
Nature stirs and wakes from blue,
Bud to bloom, the world ignites,
Colors dance in pure delights.

Fields of green with promise shine,
Where rivers gleam and hearts entwine;
Every leaf in joyous cheer,
Whispers secrets, sweet and clear.

- John Burroughs
