The Eve of St. Agnes
The owl, for all his feathers, was a crow.
A dry sad vestige of the soft moon,
Strongly inclining towards late-night woe,
He moved like water, tender and opportune,
For I was lost amidst the nature’s feeling hearts,
Who welcomed in as flowers feel the dew of morn.

Thus, there sat a maiden long ago,
Amongst the woods at twilight circling back,
Heard whispers carried lightly on the flow,
Holding them dear like dreams from the track.


- John Keats
