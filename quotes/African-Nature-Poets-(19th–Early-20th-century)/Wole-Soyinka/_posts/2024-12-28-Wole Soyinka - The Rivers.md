The River’s Calling
The river sings—a gentle lure,
With its crystal smile, pure and demure,
Through jungles deep and marshes wide,
It flows, a companion, to wander beside.

Emerald trails of forest sigh,
Where the fishermen cast and the birds fly,
Shimmering dreams in ripples bright,
Caressed by the sun, kissed by the night.

O enchanted water, flow on and on,
Through the valley and hills, beneath the dawn,
In the whispers of thalers, in twilight’s throng,
In your soothing paths, we all belong.

- Wole Soyinka
