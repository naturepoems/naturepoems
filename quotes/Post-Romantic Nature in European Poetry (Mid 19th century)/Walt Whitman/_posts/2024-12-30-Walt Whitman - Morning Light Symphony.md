---

In the stillness of the morning light,
Where shadows play upon the dew,
Listen close to the symphony bright,
That nature plays anew.

The stream sings sweetly through the glade,
Each ripple echoes a tale of grace,
With every note in the chorus laid,
Find love in this sacred place.

So let us roam 'neath the wide, wide sky,
With hearts aflame and spirits bold,
For in nature’s gentle lullaby,
We find a truth that’s untold.

- Walt Whitman
