quote: "In the forest, where the light breaks through,
The leaves resonate with the sigh of the sky,
And the mind lies open to the cleansing light,
In a universe where shadows shape thoughts,
Filling the air with echoes of the past."

In the forest, where the light breaks through,
The leaves resonate with the sigh of the sky,
And the mind lies open to the cleansing light,
In a universe where shadows shape thoughts,
Filling the air with echoes of the past.
