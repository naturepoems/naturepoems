Upon the sea, the white sails gleam,
As ships embark on journeys grand;
The ocean whispers every dream,
While beckoning with waves of sand.

Each tide that comes brings change anew,
A reminder of life's ebb and flow;
In nature's hands, we're but a few,
Yet boundless is the love we sow.


- W H Auden
