The Skies

The skies above, a canvas wide,  
With clouds that dance and softly glide,  
In colors rich, they change and drift,  
An artist's hand, a stunning gift.

The sun will rise, the stars will gleam,  
Each twilight whispers, each dawn beams,  
From blue to gray, from light to dark,  
In every hue, a subtle spark.

Oh, skies so vast, so full of grace,  
You cradle dreams in your embrace,  
In nature's heart, I look and see,  
The endless beauty, wild and free.

- Margaret Munro
