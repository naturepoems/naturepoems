In summertime and easy air,
I wander through the wild-flower field,
And each blossom wakes thoughts that care,
From our hearts to light concealed.

But the golden shade and silver dew,
They provide the pencil for every tale,
That whispers soft across the blue,
For every wanderer of this trail.

- A E Housman
