Birches
When I see birches bend to left and right
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,
I like to think some boy's been swinging them.
But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.
Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
After a rain. They click upon themselves
As the breeze rises, and an oath is ungraced
But I am here to say
don't just let the boy bend
the birches, I would like to see
so many boys making swings.

So don't just let them bend,
I would like to see their grace
so long as you don't forget to breathe.

- Robert Frost
