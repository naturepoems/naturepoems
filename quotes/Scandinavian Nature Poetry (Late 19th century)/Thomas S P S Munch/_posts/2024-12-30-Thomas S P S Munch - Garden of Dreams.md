Garden of Dreams
In the garden where wildflowers sway,
colors burst like laughter in bright array,
petals dance with the tender breeze,
a mosaic of beauty that aims to please.

Bees hum softly, a sweet serenade,
a banquet of nectar, their work displayed,
a symphony painted in nature’s hue,
in this sacred space, I find the true.

Earth’s artistry, in fragrant blooms,
a sanctuary of life that brightly looms,
a whisper of hope in each blossom seen,
in the garden of dreams, I reign as queen.


- Thomas S P S Munch
