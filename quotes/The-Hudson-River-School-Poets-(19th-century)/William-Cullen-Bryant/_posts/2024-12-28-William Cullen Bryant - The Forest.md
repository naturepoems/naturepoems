The Forest Hymn

The groves were God’s first temples. Ere man made
His debut in the world of life, they stood
Amid the cooling shade, a world apart, 
Crowning the mountains, swelling in rebuke
To the low path of man, that wanders up
The mountain’s side, or springs from vacant fields.
Not one bird takes a place of its own.
No forlorn nature vows to tear apart.
Life still mingles with life, a myriad dance,
An endless stream,
Wandering beneath the weight of trees too great
To turn upon themselves, 
Too strong to bend before
The winds, and just too proud to let them fall.

The winds that walk through them, or wear the drops
Of yielding dew, work spells over them; Yet they, 
A communion of ancient motes in silence, 
Focus eternity into a single look. 
The leaves ascend in evident delight.
They find their roots in barren stone
Through the wealth of ashes gathered from
The nation’s ruins, and grow
As we rise above the measure of mortality.

- William Cullen Bryant
