The Flower’s Tryst

   Come, oh, come,  
   where the bright grass sways,
   a swift sun slides,
   petals quivering,
   wide wings beyond senses.
   Where the wild roses                    
   darken deep
   All the coral dusk,  
   we shall meet,  
   tend to the dark blooms,
   close as a waltz.

- HD Hilda Doolittle
