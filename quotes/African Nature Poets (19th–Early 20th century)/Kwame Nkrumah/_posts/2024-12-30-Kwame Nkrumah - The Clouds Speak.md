The Clouds Speak
Oh listen! The clouds have secrets to tell,
Of distant lands where the rainbows dwell.
As they drift and gather, in gray and in white,
They weave tales of storms, of day turned to night.

When thunder rumbles and lightning darts,
Nature’s own symphony, the wildest of arts.
But when they dissolve in the gentle rain,
It's a shower of blessings, nourishing the plain.

- Kwame Nkrumah
