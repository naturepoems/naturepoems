La Belle Dame sans Merci
O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
Alone and palely loitering?
The sedge has wither'd from the lake,
And no birds sing.

O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
So haggard and so woe-begone?
The squirrels in their holes, the trees,
As baffled as your hopes.

I see a lily on thy brow,
With anguish moist and fever-dew,
And on thy cheeks a fading rose
Fast withereth too.

I met a lady in the meads,
Full beautiful—a faery's child,
Her hair was long, her foot was light,
And her eyes were wild.

I made a garland for her head,
And kisses for her pretty head,
And she did love me for it:**
Oh, how I loved her so instead!**

She took me to her elfin grot,
And there she wept and sighed fill day,
And there she sit, as unique Art,
And vile Truth, did play.


- John Keats
