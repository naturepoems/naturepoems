Nature in its wild embrace,
A cacophony of color,
Vivid as a painter’s brush,
Every petal, every leaf,
Mirrors the pulse of the earth.

Birds sing their rhapsody,
A symphony of life’s essence,
Each note strung with the thread
Of sunlit dreams and vivid skies,
Dancing on the breeze,
Celebrating existence in full bloom.

The scent of soil after rain,
A lover’s kiss upon the ground,
Awakens the senses to the gifts,
Life bestows with open arms,
Weaving destiny in the tapestry
Of everything that breathes and grows.

Here beneath the towering trees,
With roots tangled in history,
I find solace amidst the chaos,
Nature’s pulse, my heartbeat,
All that I am,
A fragment of this marvelous world.

- Ettore Cozzani
