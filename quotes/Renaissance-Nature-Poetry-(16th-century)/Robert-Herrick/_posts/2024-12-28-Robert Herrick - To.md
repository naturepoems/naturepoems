To Blossoms

Ode to blossoms! How sweetly you come
To adorn the garden, where sunshine is your home!
Bring back the memories of the springtime days,
When laughter and cheer ran wild in every phrase.

Your delicate petals, so bright and so fair,
Bathe in the sunlight, perfume in the air.
Be short-lived, sweet flowers, but let it be known,
In the hearts of all who see you, your beauty has grown.

- Robert Herrick
