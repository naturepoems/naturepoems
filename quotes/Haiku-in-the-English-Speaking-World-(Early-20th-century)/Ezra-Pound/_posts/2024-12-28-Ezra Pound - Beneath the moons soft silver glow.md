quote: "Beneath the moon's soft silver glow,  
   waterfowl carve paths in lakes,  
   a tranquil night in nature's arms.
    
   Stars blink in an endless void,  
   while crickets sing their symphony,  
   solitude's music fills the air."

Beneath the moon's soft silver glow,  
   waterfowl carve paths in lakes,  
   a tranquil night in nature's arms.
    
   Stars blink in an endless void,  
   while crickets sing their symphony,  
   solitude's music fills the air.

- Ezra Pound
