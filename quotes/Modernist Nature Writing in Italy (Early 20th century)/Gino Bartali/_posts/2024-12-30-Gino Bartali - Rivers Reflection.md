The river runs,  
a mirror of the sky,  
a conduit of stories,  
holding the earth's breath.  
With every bend and turn,  
it carves its path,  
whispering secrets to the shores,  
a testimony of change.  

Willows weep,  
a gentle reminder  
of time's passage,  
as the water flows,  
a soft embrace of life.

- Gino Bartali
