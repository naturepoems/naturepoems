The Secret Garden
 
In shadows deep, where flowers bloom,  
A secret garden waits in peace,  
Each petal bright dispels the gloom,  
In nature's haven, sorrows cease.  

The gentle breeze, the fragrant air,  
With every step, a magic found,  
In hidden paths, a love to share,  
In silence sweet, our hearts are bound.

- Edward Burne-Jones
