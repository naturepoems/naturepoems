The tides of time shall cease to flow
   When gently rocks the night;
   Yet in this flow of all we know,
   The heart ignites the light.
   The waves shall call and sweetly sway,
   To ebb and rise with dreams,
   Each moment, like a child at play,
   In rhythm’s whispered themes.
   On sands of time we dance and sing,
   The lessons life bestows;
   As nature’s bounty ever brings,
   The peace that gently blows.

- Sarah Orne Jewett
