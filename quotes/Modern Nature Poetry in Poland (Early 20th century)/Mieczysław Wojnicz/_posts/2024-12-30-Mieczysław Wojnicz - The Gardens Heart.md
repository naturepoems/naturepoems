The Garden's Heart
In quiet corners, blossoms show,
The tender heart of earth below,
Where every petal tells a tale,
Of sun and rain and sweet travail.

In colors bold, a painter's dream,
The garden flows like gentle stream,
And in its beauty, we discover,
The simple grace of nature’s lover.

- Mieczysław Wojnicz
