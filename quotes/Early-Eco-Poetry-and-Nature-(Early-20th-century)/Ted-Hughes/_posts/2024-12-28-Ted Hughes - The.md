The Wind
When it howls—
a fury, a wrath,
it storms through the branches
like a frenzy unleashed.
With wild abandon it twists the trees,
a beauty grave yet alive;
it speaks the language of ages,
a breath of earth itself.

In its chaos, find the edge,
a push against time,
a longing only land can know,
it rages yet cradles softly,
a promise lasting beyond storms.
Hold tight to the whisp of night
a glimpse of it whispers on every hill,
a tangled path through life, the wind—
a lonesome song and a home.

- Ted Hughes
