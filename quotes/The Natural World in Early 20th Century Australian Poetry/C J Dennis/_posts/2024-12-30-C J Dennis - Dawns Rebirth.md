The dawn breaks with colors, that dance on the streams,
And the birds fill the world with their jubilant dreams;
With the grass dressed in diamonds, a canvas so true,
Every leaf sings in chorus, the morning anew.

For the kiss of the sunlight on the waking land,
Is a blessing of nature, a gift of her hand;
While the whispers of breezes tell the tales of the trees,
And the heart of creation finds peace in the leaves.
