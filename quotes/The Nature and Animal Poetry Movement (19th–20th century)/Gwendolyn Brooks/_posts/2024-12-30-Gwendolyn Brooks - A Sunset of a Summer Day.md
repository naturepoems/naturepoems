A Sunset of a Summer Day

Here falls the day indeed,
And drapes steeply down,
Stretching across the green fields,
Emblazoned with quiet frowns.

The couples dance in dusky light,
While crickets sing low-long,
Wrapping the earth in whispered hush,
When further birds carry on.

Where life lingers lightly,
And flowers forget the sting,
Dancing across these valleys,
The earth slips into night.


- Gwendolyn Brooks
