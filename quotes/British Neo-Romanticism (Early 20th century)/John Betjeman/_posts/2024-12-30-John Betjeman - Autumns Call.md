Where forests stand with ancient grace,
And leaves parade in autumn's lace,
The crunch beneath my wandering feet,
A rhythm sweet, lifeâ€™s pure retreat.

The golden leaves like gems descend,
A soft embrace, the earth will mend,
In every shade, a story told,
Nature's wonders, bright and bold.

- John Betjeman
