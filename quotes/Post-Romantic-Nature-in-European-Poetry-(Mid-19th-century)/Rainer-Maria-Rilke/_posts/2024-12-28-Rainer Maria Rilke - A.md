A Field

Beyond the hedgerows stretching out,
Where wildflowers dance in the breeze,
There lies a vast expanse of gold,
Kissed by the sun, at peace with the sky.

Every blossom tells a story,
Of rain and sun, sighs and dreams,
As the gentle earth cradles them,
In a tapestry woven with light and love.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
