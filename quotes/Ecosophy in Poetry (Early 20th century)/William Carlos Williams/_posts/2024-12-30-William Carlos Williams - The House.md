The House

Within the garden,

a tree, beside our

house amid

the petals of an

armored day.

The roses hang

bright and real.

The air swirls

with motion,

as love does

when it gathers

with new resolve.

We dance

to the yellow sun

at the day's end.

We will hold it

in our open

hands.

- William Carlos Williams
