In the Forest of Shadows  
Light fights the twilight,  
trees stand sentinel,  
a congregation of wood and leaf,  
clinging to secrets,  
their twisted forms  
echoing ancient tales.

Each rustle is  
a whisper of the past,  
beneath the gaze of the moon,  
a symphony erupts,  
as shadows dance  
yonder night’s embrace.

Moss carpets the ages,  
while roots weave  
through the earth’s  
tender skin,  
a tapestry of life,  
every breath a pulse,  
where time ceases  
to matter.

- Richard Huelsenbeck
