Oh, the soul of the river,
   That murmurs along,
A melody endless,
   A perpetual song.

With its waters all gleaming,
   And a voice like the breeze,
It whispers sweet secrets
   Through the shadowy trees.

So the heart finds its solace,
   In the deep woods of green,
Where the beauty of Nature
   Is forever serene.

- James Fenimore Cooper
