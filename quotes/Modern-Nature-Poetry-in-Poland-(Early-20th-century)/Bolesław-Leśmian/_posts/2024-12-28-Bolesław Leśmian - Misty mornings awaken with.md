Misty mornings awaken with grace,
Wrapping the world in a gossamer veil,
Each drop holds the light in a soft embrace,
Where the whispers of heaven on earth shall prevail.

The mountains stand regal, the rivers flow pure,
And the horizon stretches with colors that blend,
In this sacred shelter, we find the allure,
As the heart dances wild, in nature we mend.


- Bolesław Leśmian
