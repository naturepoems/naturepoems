Nature's Symphony

The rustling leaves are the violins,
Soft chirps of the crickets, the strings,
Flapping wings of the birds, the brass,
While the wind is the breath of all things.

As dusk falls down a melodic line,
The universe hums in chorus sublime,
Moonlight dances upon silver streams,
Nature’s rhythm entwining dreams.

At dawn, the flute sings in dewdrops,
Rhythm of hearts in unison beats;
Each creature a note in this grand score,
An endless serenade for sunshine streets.


- Richard Huelsenbeck
