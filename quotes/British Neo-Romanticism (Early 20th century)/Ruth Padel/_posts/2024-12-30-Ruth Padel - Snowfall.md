Snowfall
Slowly, softly, it begins to fall,  
a blanket of quiet,  
every flake a sigh of peace,  
transforming the landscape into silence.

I watch, enraptured,  
as the familiar world shifts,  
every edge softened,  
every color muted,  
a canvas waiting for the artistâ€™s brush.

In this stillness, I find beauty,  
renewal wrapped in white,  
where time halts,  
and every breath warms the air,  
a brief moment of magic.

- Ruth Padel
