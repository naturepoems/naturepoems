Ode to a Pine

I thought that I would be a quiet tree,
Firm-rooted in the ground with sun and rain,
But on this secluded crag, alone, I see
All beauty shines this mountain like a chain.

In ancient vigor stand the mighty pines,
Their branches stretch with proud serenity.
Oh, can it be that I am one of these lines
Of force and grace that flow in harmony!

- Joyce Kilmer
