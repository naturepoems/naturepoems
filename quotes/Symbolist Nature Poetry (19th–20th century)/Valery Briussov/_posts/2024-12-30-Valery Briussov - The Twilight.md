The Twilight

In twilight’s hush, the world transforms,
As day surrenders to the night,
A tapestry of shadows forms,
And all is swathed in dusky light.

The skyline curls as colors blend,
In gentle strokes of pink and gold,
A symphony that knows no end,
While nature’s heart begins to fold.

The whisper of the evening breeze,
A lullaby for weary souls,
Invites the stars to take their ease,
As moonlight spills and softly rolls.

In this embrace of dusk's sweet song,
Find solace where the heart can dwell,
For in this moment, we belong,
To nature's breath, to peace, so well.
