The Wattle

Uncurled from the mould, love on his knees,  
A golden blossom bloomsâ€”  
The wattle welcomes her back with a wild motion,  
Above her, the shadow dances free.  
For out of the sun, the whispers arise  
And drift through the sorrows of trees;  
Like the scents of the earth beneath her,  
The heat speaks softly, nature teaches,  
Fingers glide gently through pain.  
Oh, wattle! the story begun!  
What  
An illumination comes, with glance!

- Lesbia Harford
