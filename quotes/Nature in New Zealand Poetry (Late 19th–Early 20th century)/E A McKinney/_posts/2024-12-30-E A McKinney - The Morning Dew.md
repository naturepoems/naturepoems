The Morning Dew

When dawn breaks softly with tender light,
The world awakes from the blanket of night,
The grass is adorned with jewels so fine,
Each droplet a wish, a silent divine.

They glisten and shimmer in warm sun's rays,
A fleeting moment in nature’s ballet,
With each step we take on this verdant floor,
We tread on the gems that were gifted before.

Such beauty so fragile, yet bold in its hue,
A promise of life, forever renew,
Take heed of the morning, its secrets hold,
In the simplest of moments, stories unfold.
