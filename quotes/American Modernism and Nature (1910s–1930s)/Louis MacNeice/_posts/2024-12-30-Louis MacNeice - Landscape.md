Landscape  

In the evening air the waves are  
All soft lilacs and sombre, singing  
In a darkness rippling away;  
Each green grace of frond  
Carrying cool notes of hope.  

In a wind of trust  
The lie of beauty entreats me  
With its grace, its trembling,  
As the shadows are drawn out  
And laid, a sweet store to be gathered.  

So sea-saturn leaves  
Hush the throb of  
The fountain weaving among the precincts  
Of what I believe in the promise of each day —  
The sea of green cloths;  
Whose waves illuminate space;  
And call me back from sorrow  
With their patterns in silver.  

So sweetly they are connected,  
The beauties call to me still —  
What which is today remains as  
A landscape forever unfurled.

- Louis MacNeice
