The golden hour casts its sunlight divine,
While shadows dance softly where the woodlands entwine.
The clamor of day fades to eveningâ€™s sweet song,
Where nature wraps earth in her blanket, so strong.

With every dusk falling, there whispers a tale,
Of the beauty in silence where hearts can unveil.
Each moment suspended, time drifts and then sways,
In the wildness of nature, serenity stays.


- Willa Cather
