---

Weep not for the joys that are over,
Weep not for the memories flown;
They were but shadows of beauty
Gone when the light has shone.

The shade of the tree in the summer,
The sound of the brook on the hill,
The glittering diamonds of starlight,
Did they not bring you your fill?


- Elizabeth Siddal
