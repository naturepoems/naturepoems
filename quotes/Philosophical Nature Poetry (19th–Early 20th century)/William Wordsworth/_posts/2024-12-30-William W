Oh look, how bright the morning stars!
And yet the sounds of summer leap,
This life sings out from fire’s bars,
Where every leaf and flower peep,

And tell a tale of sun and rain,
As though a joy had kissed the dawning day;
Each creature joins a sweet refrain,
With earth that proves the heart’s true way.

A glade of dreams, a fluttering light,
Oh, please there lead me, Nature's hand;
In deepening twilight’s soft respite,
Hold tight this beauty, oh so grand.


- William Wordsworth
