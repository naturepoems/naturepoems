Here in the woodlands, far apart,
I tread the old familiar ground,
Where once again I reach my heart
In tune with natureâ€™s silent sound.

The whispering leaves and rustling air
Bring memories sweet as all can be,
As if the fingers of my prayer
Can dance with joy among the trees.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
