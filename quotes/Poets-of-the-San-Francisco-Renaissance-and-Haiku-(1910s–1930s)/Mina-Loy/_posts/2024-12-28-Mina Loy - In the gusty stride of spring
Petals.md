quote: "In the gusty stride of spring,
Petals tremble, 
Glistening dew drops settle and fall,
Each blade of grass, a tower
Under the royal carpet of daffodils.
The sun labors slowly,
Etching its warmth on underbellies,
A push against winter's clutch,
While the sky stretches wide, 
Laving in blue with clouds like dreams."

In the gusty stride of spring,
Petals tremble, 
Glistening dew drops settle and fall,
Each blade of grass, a tower
Under the royal carpet of daffodils.
The sun labors slowly,
Etching its warmth on underbellies,
A push against winter's clutch,
While the sky stretches wide, 
Laving in blue with clouds like dreams.

- Mina Loy
