The forest is dark, the forest is deep,
A sea of shadows where secrets sleep;
Where bramble and thorn and ivy entwine,
And the whispering leaves drink the dew divine.

Here the silver birch stands tall and proud,
Stretching her limbs, shrouded in cloud.
A cradle of green in a world of grey,
Breathing soft life into the day.

- David Jones
