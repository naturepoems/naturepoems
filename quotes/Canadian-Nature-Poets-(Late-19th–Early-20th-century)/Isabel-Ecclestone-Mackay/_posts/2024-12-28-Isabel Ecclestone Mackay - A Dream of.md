A Dream of Dawn

When morning breaks with golden hair,  
And whispers through the trees so high,  
It paints the earth with tender care,  
And wakes the world with mystic sigh.  

The dewdrops glisten, diamonds clear,  
On petals soft, and shining wide;  
As silence wraps the earth, my dear,  
In twilight hours, love is our guide.  

So let us roam through sunlit fields,  
Where every shadow fades away;  
Nature’s heart, her love reveals  
That in her song—we too may stay.  

—Isabel Ecclestone Mackay
