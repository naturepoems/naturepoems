The Country

What is the country, if not a dream?
It whispers secrets in every glen,
Each river flowing, a silver stream,
In nature’s arms, we find our zen.

The hills that rise, the valleys low,
Each petal soft, each stone so wise,
In every turn, the heart’s glow,
The country speaks, where beauty lies.


- Edward Thomas
