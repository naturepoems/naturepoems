Wanderer of the verdant paths,
    bear witness to the silence,
    where the petals whisper,
   secrets of the intertwined.

Trembling of leaves,
   like delicate hearts,
   sharing their sorrows,
   with the murmur of wind,
    the layers of the dusk.
 
A world enshrined in green,
   infinitesimal shades,
   the intimacy of soil
    speaks in reverence,
   while time uncoils,
   resting like a serpent
   ‘neath the golden bark.

Here we belong,
   amid the breath of trees,
   harmonizing lives,
   under the sway of a sky,
   where every glance intersects
   with grace.

- Eugène Guillevic
