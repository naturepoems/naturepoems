Underneath
the fern's embrace,
I carry with me
the scent of all
your buried dreams,
drenched in gentle light,
a falling shadow above.

Tender leaf,
you breathe with slow motion,
a flickering glance
in the threshold glowing,
where the sun has found,
quiet moments lying down.

O delicate time,
let me draw near,
for I am drawn
to the sweetness of old,
a brush of soft winds
that linger above.

Whisper here,
fills the grasses below,
where love colors
the earth and then soars,
in the grove of a day about to fade.
