Upon the hills, soft with spring,  
Where blossoms weave with sweet perfume,
I wander forth, and nature sings  
As if the world from dark would bloom.

The dancing trees, adorned in gold,  
Embrace the sunlight's gentle hand,
With every breath, the earth unfolds,
In hues of love, eternally grand.


- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
