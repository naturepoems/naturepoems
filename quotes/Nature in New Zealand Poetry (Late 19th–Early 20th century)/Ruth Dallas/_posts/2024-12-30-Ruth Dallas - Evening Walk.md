I walked along the winding path,  
Where the ferns grow wild and the shadows play;  
In the quiet hush, I felt the wrath  
Of time standing still at the close of day.  

The whispers of leaves and the softest sigh  
Of the breeze through the trees filled my heart with peace;  
And as twilight deepens, I know not why  
My soul in this beauty finds perfect release.

- Ruth Dallas
