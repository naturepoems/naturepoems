The Reflection
In the mirror of the lake,
Where the world holds its breath,
Every leaf, every branch,
Is captured in a perfect stillness,
The sky dips low to kiss the water,
And doubt fades like the ripples,
Time suspended in quiet grace,
Where the soul finds its peace,
In the embrace of natureâ€™s gaze.


- John Gould Fletcher
