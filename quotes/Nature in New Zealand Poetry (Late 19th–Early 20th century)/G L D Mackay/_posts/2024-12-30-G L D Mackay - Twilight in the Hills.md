Twilight in the Hills

In the stillness of the evening dim,  
When the shadows fall and the light grows dim,  
And the winds that sigh in the petals’ blush  
Gently hush in the vale and the thicket's hush.

How the fires of dusk softly stream and glow,  
On the golden leaves that lie below!  
In the tender twilight, peace has come,  
To the breath of the night now sweet and numb.


- G L D Mackay
