When twilight filters soft through the wood,
And whispers of magic drift gray and good,
Where shadows do dance in cloaks of the night,
The world wears a robe of starlit delight.

A brook babbles low, with secrets it weaves,
Its stories of centuries tangled in leaves,
As whispers of songs, lost to the ages,
Resound in the hearts of nature's own sages.

Take heed, little wanderers, seek not the lure,
Of cities that glimmer, their promises sure.
For in every rustle and hush of the night,
Lies wisdom unyielding, pure, and alight.

- Frank Norris
