The Chirp of the Nightingale  
When the day is gone, and shadows creep,  
The nightingale in her sorrow sings,  
Her trilling notes, a promise deep,  
Of dawnâ€™s embrace, with golden wings.

O lullaby of endless tune,  
For weary souls who seek to rest,  
Sweet creature of the dusk and moon,  
Your melodies do soothe the distressed.

In every note, a tearful grace,  
In every pause, a tender prayer,  
Her plaintive sighs, a heartfelt trace  
Of love, a life so fragile and rare.

Thus bides the night, beneath black skies,  
While hopeful dreams, like stars entwine,  
And as the dawn begins to rise,  
I see her song, forever divine.

- Richard Crashaw
