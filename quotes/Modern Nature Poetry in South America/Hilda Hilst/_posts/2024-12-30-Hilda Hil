The stillness falls,
a cloak of serenity,
where the earth meets the sky,
each breath a gentle wave,
a caress from the universe.

Mountains hold the silence,
a echo through time,
while rivers hum a tune,
a melody of movement,
a dance of life.

In this moment,
become unbound,
let nature's heartbeat
resonate within,
feed on the quiet, and become whole.


- Hilda Hilst
