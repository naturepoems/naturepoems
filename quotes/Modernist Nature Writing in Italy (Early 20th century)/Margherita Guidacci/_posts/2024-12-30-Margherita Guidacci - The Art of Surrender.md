Every season wears its crown,
a regal cloak of change,
where leaves turn from green
to a burst of dying fire,
dancing to the earth’s own tempo.

In such surrender,
I learn the art of letting go,
a child of the earth,
cradled in cycles,
a witness to nature’s grace,
yielding to moments both sweet and aching.

- Margherita Guidacci
