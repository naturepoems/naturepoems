Beneath the Stars
In the hush of night, the world anew,
Beneath a quilt of midnight blue,
Stars like whispers scattered wide,
In their glow, we dream, we bide.

The moon, a lantern, guides the way,
Through shadowed paths where lost hopes play,
With every twinkle, a promise bright,
That even darkness brings its light.

- Mieczysław Wojnicz
