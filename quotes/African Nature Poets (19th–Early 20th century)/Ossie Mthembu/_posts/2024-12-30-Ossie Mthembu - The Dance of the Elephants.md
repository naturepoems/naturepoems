The Dance of the Elephants

In the dusk, they gather,
Lords of the savannah,
Trumpeting notes of joy,
In a celestial waltz.

Their shadows stretch long,
Against a painted sky,
Casting echoes of laughter,
As they roam wild and free.

Oh, the majesty within,
The strength wrapped in grace,
Nature's timeless ballet,
Rhythms of an ancient space.

- Ossie Mthembu
