The light
is a silver glue
that holds all things together;
the green and the gold,
the paleness of the rose,
the deep blue of the sky
beneath which we justify our existence.

This gold will fade,
the trees will bend or break,
the roads will yield
through the drift of time,
but this light,
this light will embody
our hopes,
our lives,
our dreams.

- Nadine Gordimer
