The woodland depths, where ferns and blossoms
In summer's charm their secrets keep,
Where rich and warm the sunbeams glisten
And mirthful voices wake from sleep.

And there, where lilacs love to languish
And primroses perfume the air,
Among the stillness, peaceful, gracious,
I wander on without a care.


- F W Harvey
