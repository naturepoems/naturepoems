Eternal Silence  
Lied deep in the forest,  
a slumber they keep.  
Through the leaves, whispers  
of the wind creep.  
Endless green shadows  
that dance in the glen,  
glimmers of sunlight  
like drops of rain.  
As I breathe in the calm,  
my worries depart,  
lost in the stillness,  
in nature's heart.

- Carl Robert Jakobson
