Garden

In the garden, I wander,
Among the flowered tales of time,
Where each petal murmurs
Secrets to the wind.

The paths twist like memories,
Leading me into their depths,
Each turn a journey,
Every moment a return.

Brick walls echo the sun,
Amidst a riot of green,
Where nature is poet, and
The poet is a mere visitor.


- Jorge Luis Borges
