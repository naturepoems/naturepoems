It was night when the stars gleamed,
  A time to hold breathe,
The earth howled at the moon,
   In time sustained—
And wild sounds
Of long tender dawns,
  Egrets painted the banks,
       their cries broke
          the silence—
The light showed everywhere,
And far in the trees.
The wind urged,
  bringing pulses of song.
Yet in the tactile air,
We feel the beauty round and bright;
A stark peace solemn and brightened, too.

- Lorine Niedecker
