quote: "Snowdrop  
    In the frost, a promise is folded tight,  
    A snowdrop peeks at the thaw.  
    Beneath cold earth, it feels the light,  
    Hiding its beauty, without a flaw.  

    It waits for the sun to sway,  
    With patience, its bloom will unfurl,  
    A herald of spring’s bright array,  
    A dainty flag in this world."

Snowdrop  
    In the frost, a promise is folded tight,  
    A snowdrop peeks at the thaw.  
    Beneath cold earth, it feels the light,  
    Hiding its beauty, without a flaw.  

    It waits for the sun to sway,  
    With patience, its bloom will unfurl,  
    A herald of spring’s bright array,  
    A dainty flag in this world.
