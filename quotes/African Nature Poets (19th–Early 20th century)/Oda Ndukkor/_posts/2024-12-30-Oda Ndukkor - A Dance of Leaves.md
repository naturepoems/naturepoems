A Dance of Leaves
In the rustling leaves, a dance begins,
With autumn’s breath, the cycle spins.
Floating gently to the ground,
Nature’s whispers all around.

Colors burst in crimson and gold,
A tapestry of stories told.
In every movement, life’s embrace,
A fleeting moment, a sacred space.


- Oda Ndukkor
