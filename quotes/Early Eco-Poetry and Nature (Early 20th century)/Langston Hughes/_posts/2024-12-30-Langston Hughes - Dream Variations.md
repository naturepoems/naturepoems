Dream Variations

To fling my arms wide
In some place of the sun,
To whirl and to dance
Till the white day is done,

Then rest at cool evening
Beneath a tall tree,
While dusk is not done,
But will not pass me by.

To be in the world like the sun,
To laugh and to play
Like the rounded oceans,
Uncaring of the day.

These are my dreams.

But they won't pass me by,
Not in the cool evening
When the tall trees sigh.

Dusk is not done,
It whispers softly to my heart,
While my dreams will cradle me
Till the world departs.

- Langston Hughes
