Here’s a mighty oak that stands,
Each ring a year, each leaf a life,
In its branches, the winds weave tales,
A witness to joy, heartache, and strife.

Let me rest in this haven, a shelter,
Underneath its expansive might,
It offers me solace, wisdom, and comfort,
In the grandeur of day, and the peace of night.

- Walt Whitman
