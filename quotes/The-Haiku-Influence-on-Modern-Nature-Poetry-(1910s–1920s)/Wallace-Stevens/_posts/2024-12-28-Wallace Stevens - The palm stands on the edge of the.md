The palm stands on the edge of the cliff,  
In the starlight,  
But to the east,  
The ocean drops  
And disappears below.  
Its elements  
Of shadows and steak,  
Are written in the soft sands.

And there they felt them,  
Young men with winds in their hair,  
Knowing where the earth  
Ends, in a garden,  
Where the nuances of the sea  
Mingle with memory,  
Like whispers of light.

- Wallace Stevens
