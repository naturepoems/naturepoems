The Pond  
  ---------  
Let us lie down alone,  
  By the banks of the pond,  
And see the lilies blossom—  
  Blue and white and gold;  
And hear the soft murmur  
Of the water unbroken,  
For the earth is as still  
As it was never spoken.  

  See the stars reflected  
And they still wink in the dark;  
They spread their soft light  
In graceful arcs  
Despite the moan of the night;  
Time stands still,  
As I think of our souls—  
And go home with a sigh.  


- Edna St Vincent Millay
