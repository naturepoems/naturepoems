Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird
I.
Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.

II.
I heard it in the wind.
It was like a thought
That a man might have —
Of a blackbird — of a blackbird’s eye,
And the sound of its cry
Among the snowy mountains.

- Wallace Stevens
