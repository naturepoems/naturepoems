What more could I desire,
Than a glass of wine
And this lovely night,
Where the colors of the evening
Softly breathe their sighs?
With a sea of stars above,
And a whispering wind,
Oh how pleased my heart would be,
To find a love divine!
Oh those rose-twined valleys,
Where the rushing river flows,
Where the moonlight dances lightly,
And the wild flower grows like hope.
Here, nature wraps her loving arms,
Giving peace, a soothing balm.

How Oak and Ash do share their shade,
The dainty ivy does cascade.
An endless sway of grass and trees,
Buffeting winds and buzzing bees,
A fragrance in the cooling air,
Charming scents with love they share.
With every leaf and every gust,
The world's alive, it feels as must.
Dreams flow through the branches broad,
Each blade of grass a warm applaud.

Take me there, where nature rests,
In Eden's chest, my tiny nest.
For in that realm, with arms stretched wide,
I find my strength, I find my guide.

- John Keats
