I
The earth is a great thing,
And the sky is a great thing,
And the sun is a great thing.
But they would be nothing
Without the light of love.

II
The trees that bore our childhood,
The brook that sang of my youth,
The birds that built their nests,
And stored their eggs in our hearts. 

III
O narrow and fine way,
O dull and narrow road,
O old and crooked line,
You will lead me unafraid.

IV
Under the soft pale glow
Of the waxing moon,
Beneath the boughs of willows,
The earth is hushed and waits.

- Sara Teasdale
