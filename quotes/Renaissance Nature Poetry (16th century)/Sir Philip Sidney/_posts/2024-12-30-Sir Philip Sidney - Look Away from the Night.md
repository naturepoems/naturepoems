Look away from the night so long,  
And find where hearts belong;  
In the garden filled with light,  
Grows the joy of hearts so bright.  
Let the flowers sway and bend,  
For in love, thereâ€™s no end!

With each ray of sun that falls,  
In the laughter, pure love calls;  
Let us dance this tapestry,  
In the weave of memory!

- Sir Philip Sidney
