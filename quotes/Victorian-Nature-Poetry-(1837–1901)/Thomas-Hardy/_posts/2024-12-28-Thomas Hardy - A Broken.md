A Broken Appointment
You did not come,
And marching Time drew on,
And wore me numb.
Yet not for that, 
I will not chide you; 

It were not worth my while, 
To blame but thee; 
But upon the thought
Of thy falling, 

I was aglow,
Like one of the lighted stars—
Yet I’m not whole,—
When would you show, 

Dawn on our space,
Alleviate its face—
Would ever our life,
Support its place?

- Thomas Hardy
