The Garden Year

This is the day when, o’er the world,  
Spring flings her golden robe, unfurled;  
Each flower wakes, with smiles aglow,  
In nooks and crannies, weeds, we sow.

The labor of the winters done,  
A symphony of bloom begun;  
Let gardens flourish, let songs be sung,  
With every hue the spring has brung.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
