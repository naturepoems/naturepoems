I like to watch the sun
In the golden fields, rolling;  
Dancing in the nectar-drenched flowers,
I see the parting shadows  
Of the long house!  
Odors of ripe fruit and honey!
My heart leaps to the  
Rich beauty of life!  
Oh, how I would dream!  
Yet, something seems entrancing,  
Sacredly bound to the light!  
Rippling laughter, where the blue  
And wild grass  
Kisses the feet of a new horizon.

- Guido Gozzano
