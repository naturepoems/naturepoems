O nymph—o nymph, who playest with me,
Beneath the shades, among the whispering trees,
The cooling breeze, it brings sweet memory
Of those fair days when we were young and free!
Life was a soft, exquisite melody,
With joy repeated in the rustling leaves.
How fleeting are thy moments, nymph! But see,
Thou canst not fade, despite what sorrow weaves.


- Gustave Flaubert
