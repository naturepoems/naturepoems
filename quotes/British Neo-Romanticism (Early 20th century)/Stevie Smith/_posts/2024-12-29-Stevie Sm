Not Waving but Drowning

Nobody heard him, the dead man,
But still he lay moaning:
I was much too far out all my life
And not waving but drowning.

Poverello

I believe in the flower.
I believe in the blossom.
I believe in the beauty of the earth.
Every year after year,
I wait for the flaming and the mellow, and the summer's wreck,
The minstrels and the poets,
The shadows and the silks,
And every time I breathe
I know the flower lives.

The Shadow

The shadow, the shadow is deep,
It covers the ground like mist.
It is the friend's place,
And I am glad to be close to thee.
The shadow will take care,
While I roam far from home,
And when I return to the light,
It runs as always before me.

The Snake

The snake has a clever tongue
And muscles that grip and squeeze.
But to the snakeâ€™s cleverness
Even the chill of winter falls coldly,
Showing carpal's sieve and climbing vines,
As life pulls taut, sprouting dreams, it seems.

Spring

In the spring I saw the earth first waking,
With a patient hand it stretched open its shroud.
There, wind blown and bright,
The daffodils sang,
They spread flushed petals and called me out.
For every hour of sun was a glad relay,
And every leaf turning green made a shout.

The Winter

The winter wind has chill'd my heart
And icy snow has covered the land.
I have strayed far beneath the trees
When night closed in like a black band.
The dreams resound upon the ice,
I think the world is a grave to the heart,
Yet light breaks through the softest night,
As true as daylight, fog lifts afar.

Eagle

So gracefully the eagle flies,
With perfect wings that bend in air,
Each arch so proud, it draws the skies
As she finds peace beyond her dare.

Whether

In whether of changing climes,
Or the consuming shadows on the ground,
Nature calls with whispers poised,
To mock the self we have unbound.

The Wind

When the wind sings through the trees,
The echoes of the laughter soar,
But I remember how sweet was the breeze,
How it carried every dream ashore.

Summer

Summer casts her golden net,
In whispered hues the fields confide.
The daisies find their perfect pet,
Within the meadows where sweet scents abide.

Autumn

Autumn speaks of time's gentle toll,
With a palette rich and dismayed,
Framing life, circling the soul,
As trees in a tumble start to fade.

Heaven's Garden

In Heaven's garden, bright and lush,
Where colors swirl like waves in sea,
Nature bends so soft and plush,
With gentle grace, all is set free.

The Ocean

The ocean lifts her massive arms,
Holding sway, beneath the skies,
In wild caress, she sings her charms,
Uniting earth in longing sighs.

The Moon

The moon looks down with unblinking gaze,
Casting silver upon the fields in sight,
In quiet wonders within her blaze,
The night unfolds, each star ignites.
