We stand in the green fragrant field
  and look out over the stretch
   of the stones unturned.
In the quiet, nature enfolds us.
   Shadows of thoughts pass,
   and we find abundance
     in the silence that echoesâ€”
          what we hold within.

A soft wind carries our fears away,
   and whispering persistence
         amid the flowers reminds us.
Every petal is a prayer,
   thankful for the dawn light,
     and inviting us to stay a while.


- William Stafford
