The winter’s breath upon the frost,
A silent world, both cold and bright,
Yet in this hush, we see the cost,
Of nature's rest beneath the night.

Each flake a gem, each branch adorned,
In crystal coats, the world transforms,
And though the days may feel so worn,
Spring holds its promise, soft and warm.

- John Rea
