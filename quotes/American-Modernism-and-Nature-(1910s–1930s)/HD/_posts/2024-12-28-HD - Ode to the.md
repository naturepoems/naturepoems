Ode to the Sea

We have gathered the trees on the hills, 
the sum of their shadows, 
the vibrations of rills, 
the kiss of the flowers, 
the light of the forge on the north wind.
This is the peace  
of the blue sides of air.
Laud of the sea, 
a cry from the depth of waters, 
we have lifted a heart  
of waters.
Shining leaves, the green net  
of the fading,  
will teach my heart  
to break.

For to-morrow, 
when the sky is tied with jessamine  
your emerald accents and bright wings  
will come like tears.
I will stand still, 
in the finest tears, 
like a reed, 
x-plucked, 
yainting my chest like a macaque.

O sea, O sea, 
my heart will sleep 
for thy beauty!
