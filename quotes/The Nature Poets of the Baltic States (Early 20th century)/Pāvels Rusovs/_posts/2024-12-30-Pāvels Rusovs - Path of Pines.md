Through the labyrinth of pines,
Where shadows stretch and hide,
A path unfolds in mystery,
Leading to hidden clearings,
Where sunlight plays upon still waters.

Every footstep echoes softly,
In the quiet of the wood,
And the fragrance of wild thyme,
Wraps the wanderer in warmth,
As the forest shares its secrets.
