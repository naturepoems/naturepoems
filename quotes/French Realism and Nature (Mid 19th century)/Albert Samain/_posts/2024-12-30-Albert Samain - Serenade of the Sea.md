Serenade of the Sea

Waves ripple soft against the shore,
As twilight weaves her dusky art;
Within the sea, the heart does soar,
In the serenade of nature’s heart.

Salt in the air, like a whispered prayer,
Carries the breath of ancient lore,
Each wave a song, gentle and rare,
A rhythm that commands, forevermore.

Seagulls call, like ghosts of the past,
Sailing, dipping, in the fading light,
A chorus of life that ebbs and casts,
Shadows on dreams that dance in flight.

So here on the sand, the world so wide,
I lean to listen, to lean and sway,
In the symphony of the ocean’s glide,
I find my peace, lost, yet found this way.

- Albert Samain
