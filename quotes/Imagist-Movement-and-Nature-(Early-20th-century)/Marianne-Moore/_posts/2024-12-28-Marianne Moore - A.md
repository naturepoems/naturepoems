A Grave

I shall never see
where the dead have come to lie,
because I shall lie beneath
this board, covered with dirt.
But, if you see an orange rose,
bud of a bouquet dropped,
or a flower blooming
in the harshest of winters,
think of me as lost as that,
more lost, draped in the sweet chill
that dances upon the earth.

—I am pleased, in a tiny way,
to dissolve like a petal into the night;
let nature’s hands gently bring
me beneath her soft, covering blanket.

—Marianne Moore
