The Storm

Watch now, the sky darkens,
clouds coalesce,
a brew of chaos,
percussive thunder rolling.

Lightning, a forked tongue of the gods,
delivers the electric promise
that life renews through turmoil,
each drop of rain is birth,
the suspension of breath before the flood.

Nature, fierce and unforgiving,
it teaches us strength,
in the wildness of its heart,
a dance of elemental power
that demands we respect,
the forces we cannot tame.

- Polia de Montalcini
