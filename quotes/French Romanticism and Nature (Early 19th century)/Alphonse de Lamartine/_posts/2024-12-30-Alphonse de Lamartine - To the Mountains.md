To the Mountains

Stand tall, ye mountains, proud and grand,  
With peaks that pierce the azure sky;  
You guard the valleys, fierce and stern,  
In your embrace, where eagles fly.

The whispers of the ages dwell,  
Within your stones, your timeless grace;  
O mighty giants, hear my swell,  
As I seek refuge in your face.

In your vast arms, I feel so small,  
Yet in your heart, I feel the call;  
For in your silence lies the word,  
That speaks the truth, forever heard.

- Alphonse de Lamartine
