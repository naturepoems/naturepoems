A Poem of Suggestions

With the atmosphere

of evening

and the air is dark.

Warmth that flows

to curbs of streets  

with heat from leaves.

So minds of trees

have fitted praises
to the moss.

While the birds

cried out; ask only

the rain and as far as the day
can agree; the air still stays,

is thick now,
yet so tender.

- William Carlos Williams
