A Hidden Vale

                    Among the hills where shadows play,
                    I found a vale, so lightly dressed,
                    With ferns and heather, draped in gray,
                    It cradled peace, and left me blessed.
                    
                    Here nature weaves her softest art,
                    With dappled light on curling stream,
                    The pulse of wild, a tender heart,
                    It breathed to me the gentle dream.
                    
                    O hidden vale, a sweet retreat,
                    Where every footfall softly greets,
                    The secrets held as petals fall,
                    In nature's armsâ€”my home, my all.
