The Sky

The sky, a canvas brushed with dreams,
Where colors blend with the twilight glow,
Infinite realms of shimmering beams,
As day slips softly, in night's flow.

And stars awaken in velvet dark,
Whispers of stories from ages past,
Each one a beacon, a tiny spark,
In the cradle of the universe cast.

- John Masefield
