In the quiet of the wood,  
Where tall trees stand as guards,  
A sanctuary unfolds,  
In the shade, the heart discards,  
The burdens of its worldly roam.

Here, the fox may tread,  
And the deer, so still,  
Awareness comes alive,  
And nature’s peace will fill,  
The spirit's deep, forgotten parts.


- George Ripley
