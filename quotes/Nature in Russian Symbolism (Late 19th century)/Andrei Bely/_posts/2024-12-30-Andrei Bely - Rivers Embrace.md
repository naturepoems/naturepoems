The river flows through vale and glade, 
A liquid mirror where dreams are laid.
In every ripple, life parades, 
As sunlight dances in a cascade.

The willows weep, in sorrow, joy, 
Their branches hang, the breeze they toy.
In natureâ€™s hands, the heart's alloy, 
Her beauty, pure, no man can destroy.

So here I sit, wrapped in her glow, 
With every sigh of wind that blows,
And in this moment, all else slows, 
As nature's love continuously flows.
