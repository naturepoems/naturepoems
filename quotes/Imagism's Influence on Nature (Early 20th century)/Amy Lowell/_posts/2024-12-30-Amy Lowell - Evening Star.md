A season of calm weather
  And clear horizons,
  After a night of storms.
  The little trees swaying gently,
  And the clouds moving slowly,
  As if drowsy from too much rain.
  O fill my soul with your serenity!
  Be my blanket in this soft night.
  I would like to lie here forever
  And hear your whispering winds.
  O Evening Star, please shine down,
  Relax my life in your light.

- Amy Lowell
