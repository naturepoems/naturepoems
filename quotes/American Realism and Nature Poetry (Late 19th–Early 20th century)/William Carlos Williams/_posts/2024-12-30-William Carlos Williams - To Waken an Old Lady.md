To Waken an Old Lady

I am a little piece of

the world,

but I am still here,

never far,
even returns

with the earth.

To waken you
from sleep,

I climb low
  hills at the edge

of valleys.

I wait; the trees,

awaken me with fruits

trailing down the:

drops cumulous,
as if—

and in the breaking

of days,
I see

my songs rise, earth as said
  wouldn't be deep,

unless I heard

running down.


- William Carlos Williams
