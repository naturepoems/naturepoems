Notice to critics! To wretched critics dark,
Who court the favours of the rich but cold;  
Beware how you condemn the sun and spark,
Dare not to shade the truth in the folds of gold!

For trees that bend and break beneath their load,
Do not serve deep to break the heart;  
Nay, we, though swept in grief, lift up the road,
And give our wings to rise and stay apart!

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
