Lines Written in Kensington Gardens

Most people think that the great part of life
Is spent in great design; but I have found
That the cicerone who conducts a soul
Through the familiar face of nature’s face-

A sudden tree, a limited distance,  
A pile of vivid flowers,  

Will open up an entrance,  
Where sounds, like echoes of the long past, abound.


- Matthew Arnold
