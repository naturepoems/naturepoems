I wandered lonely as a Cloud  
That floats on high o'er vales and Hills,  
When all at once I saw a Crowd,  
A host, of Golden Daffodils;  
Beside the Lake, beneath the Trees,  
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.  

Continuous as the Stars that shine  
And twinkle on the milky Way,  
They stretched in never-ending line  
Along the margent of a Bay:  
Ten thousand I saw at a glance,  
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.  

The Waves beside them danced; but they  
Out-did the sparkling Waves in glee:  
A Poet could not but be gay,  
In such a jocund company:  
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought  
What wealth the show to me had brought:  

For oft, when on my Couch I lie  
In vacant or in pensive mood,  
They flash upon that inward Eye  
Which is the bliss of solitude;  
And then my Heart with pleasure fills,  
And dances with the Daffodils.

- Emily Dickinson
