My heart aches to find a thing so small,
   In blissful things can a breath be sweetened?
What other chance could leave thee in the sphere;
   To be, as nature wove through wings, a belief.
In silver lights strange moments breathe unmade,
   The river flows in-ys, yet carries off the clearest,
And bathing as holy waves tread the feet,
   Lies towards distill'd Mirror-joys both:
And twilight warmth that holds sweet song,
   Conceived with loving shone and wanderers.
