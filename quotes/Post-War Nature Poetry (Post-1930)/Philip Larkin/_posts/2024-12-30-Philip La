Amidst the canopy where stories bloom,
The leaves entwine with the frames of lives,
Every rustle a chapter turned with care,
In the tome of nature’s ever-turning page.

Beneath stretches of azure breath, we ponder,
Our tiny place in the labyrinth of time,
Yet each seed cast among this earthen fold,
Holds a universe thriving deep within.

With each sigh comes a trust in the unknown,
And as we wander, dreams unfurl like ferns,
In nature’s forest where silence becomes loud,
Renewing the bond we often forget we share.

Consume the light and drink the shadows deep,
For here in the splayed roots, we meet again,
Let us gather moments, vast as the sky,
And find our worth in these wild outstretched arms.

- Philip Larkin
