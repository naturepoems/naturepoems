To the Harbormaster
The white whale of the horizon
rises low and full
against the wave
and you can hear the hum
of the rocks beneath
and their sea-grass hair
flowing out to sea

It is here the real story lies
and the ship that sails away
into the dream of the other
that remains behind,
haunting the essence of
something as low as salt
and disappears into story.

- Lawrence Ferlinghetti
