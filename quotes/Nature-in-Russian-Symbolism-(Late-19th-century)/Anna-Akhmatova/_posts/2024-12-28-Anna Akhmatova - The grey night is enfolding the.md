The grey night is enfolding the world;
The stars are trembling like the sad violin's strings.
I hear the rapture of the echoes,
The lamentation of the winds, and I feel
The breath of the earth heavy with the scent of lilacs.

And here, in this moment of putting on sleep,
The night will soak up my tiredness.
So let it break loose and reach me,
Let sea and sky merge, let them eternally
Talk about the passionate struggle of better worlds.

- Anna Akhmatova
