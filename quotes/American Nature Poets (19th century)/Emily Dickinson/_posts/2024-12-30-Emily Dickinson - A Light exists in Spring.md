A Light exists in Spring
Not present on the Year
At any other period—
When March is scarcely here—

A Color stands abroad—
On a few Rubies—
The Grass is like a Sea—
The Butterflies, mere Fogs—

An Arc of Light, so bright
It's not so easy to define—
Except, to say it's but a soul
That from the Spring declines—

- Emily Dickinson
