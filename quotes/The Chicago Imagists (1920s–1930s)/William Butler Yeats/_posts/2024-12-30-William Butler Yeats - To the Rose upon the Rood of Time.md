To the Rose upon the Rood of Time

O Rose upon the Rood of Time,
     You the mother of all beauty,
     And life, which runs like a sable stream!
     Pale shade of all humanity
         Who shall see
     Till life is lost without a dream.

Like thickets of the breath of love,
     That dream of spring and bloom,
     Say, — "I would believe again
     That in time and in this season
       We can gather round the flame to bloom!"

- William Butler Yeats
