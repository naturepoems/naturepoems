Among the Dunes

Among the dunes, where grasses play,
A sea of emerald and gold, unsealed,
Winds whisper stories of the sea,
In the wake of time's shifting sand,
The hush of waves rolling ashore,
Beckoning, calling, a siren's song,
As dear moments change in cadence,
Every breath returning in celebration.

- Marianne Moore
