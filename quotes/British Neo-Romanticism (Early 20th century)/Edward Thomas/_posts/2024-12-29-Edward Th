The Path
Upon the path where the wildflowers wreath,
   I find my way through the brush,
With every step, the air I breathe,
   Awakens a sense of lush.

The sun breaks through, a golden light,
   As shadows dance with glee,
This journey calls me with delight,
   On natureâ€™s lap, I long to be.

Let me wander this trail so bright,
   Where the heart knows love and grace,
In the whispers of leaves that take flight,
   I find my place in the wild embrace.

- Edward Thomas
