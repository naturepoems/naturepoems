TO THE MOUNTAINS

O mighty mountains, time-worn guides,  
On the solemn heights where the realm is free;  
Your patience bespeaks the heart that bides  
Through all the changes of time and glee.

With crags that reach to the skies of blue,  
And paths of peace where the storm, once loud,  
Bears grace and love to the air anew  
And echoes of laughter light the crowd.

So let me rise in lofty song  
In the graces where the Air charms echo true,  
And carry my heart where I belong  
By the aurora grace of your skies in view!


- Bliss Carman
