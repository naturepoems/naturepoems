Winter’s Embrace
Cold winds dance and rivers freeze,
Nature pauses, a moment of ease,
Blankets white with snowflakes spun,
In winter's hush, the world’s undone.

Beneath the frost, life waits and dreams,
In silence wrapped, it softly gleams,
For spring will come and thaw the ground,
Within the stillness, hope is found.

- Mieczysław Wojnicz
