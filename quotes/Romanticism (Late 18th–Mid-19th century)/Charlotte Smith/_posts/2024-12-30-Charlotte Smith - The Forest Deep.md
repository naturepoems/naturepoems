The forest deep, where shadows linger long,  
Awakes with life as daylight fades away;  
The whispering winds hum Nature’s ancient song,  
As twilight casts the trees in dusky gray.  

Within these woods, find peace as night draws near,  
The moon shall guide your wandering heart so free;  
Each leaf shall fold the silence of your fear,  
For in these realms, the soul gains unity.

- Charlotte Smith
