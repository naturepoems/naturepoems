The sunset paints the world in gold,
   A soft and fleeting hue;
   Each moment holds a tale untold,
   Within the evening dew.
   The whispers of the evening breeze
   Enfold us in their grace,
   And bear us on through valleys, trees,
   To nature’s vast embrace.
   So here, beneath the sky so bright,
   We wander hand in hand,
   And find our peace in nature’s light,
   In love’s eternal strand.

- Sarah Orne Jewett
