The Piper

When the quiet of the woods is there,  
  And the sun is sinking low,  
And the shadows pass on soft, cool wings  
  To the river's smooth flow;  
I hear the call of the little things,  
  That rustle along the ground,  
And the piper of the woods, unnamed,  
  Pipes a lullaby all around.

The crickets, choristers to the dusk,  
  Among the fallen leaves,  
Chirp out their songs in the wilds of air,  
  While the evening weaves  
A tapestry rich in purple hue,  
  And the stars begin to rise;  
I listen to the whispers soft  
  That float from the shadowy skies.

O little woods, where the piper plays  
  His flute, so sweet and clear,  
Your mystery deepens in the folds  
  The night draws near;  
Till the heart of man, in the silence caught,  
  Devices the passing breath  
Of nature's secret, the hidden thought,  
  Of the great beyond, of death.

- Charles GD Roberts
