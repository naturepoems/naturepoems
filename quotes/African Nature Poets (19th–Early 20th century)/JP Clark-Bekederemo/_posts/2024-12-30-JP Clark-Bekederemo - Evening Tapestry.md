The world turns quietly,
In the cradle of the evening,
As the stars begin to twinkle,
In nature’s gentle weaving.

Each night a soft reminder,
That we are part of this,
A tapestry of moments,
In the universe’s kiss.

So let us gaze together,
At the skies, deep and wide,
For in the heart of nature,
We find our souls abide.
