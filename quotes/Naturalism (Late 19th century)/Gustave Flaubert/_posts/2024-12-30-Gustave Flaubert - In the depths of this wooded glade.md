In the depths of this wooded glade,
The silent echoes of the night,
Drifting softly through the shade,
Awake my mind to natureâ€™s might.
The moonbeams weave a silver thread,
Upon the lake so vast and clear,
I walk where restless spirits tread,
And find my heart has nothing to fear.


- Gustave Flaubert
