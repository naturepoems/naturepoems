The dawn arrives on wings of light,
A symphony, the morning’s song.
With hues of rose and gold in sight,
We’re beckoned forth where hearts are strong.

The waking world extends its hand,
To greet the day with joy anew.
In nature’s wonder, we will stand,
Embracing all that life can do.

- Marie de France
