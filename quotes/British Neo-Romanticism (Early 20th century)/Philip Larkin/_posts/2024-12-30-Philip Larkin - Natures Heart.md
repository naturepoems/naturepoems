The night's embrace held tightly fast,  
And shadows stretched across the field.  
The stars promise that joys will last,  
In nature's bounty softly sealed.

Each drop of dew embodies dreams,  
Awakening joy after the glen.  
In silence, life flows like streams,  
Taking back where it has been.

And though we often must depart,  
From nature's grasp in gentle streams;  
The echoes linger in the heart,  
Revealing all our deepest dreams.


- Philip Larkin
