Under the boughs
of an ancient oak,
a refuge from time,
a space just for dreaming.
The whispers of leaves
speak in riddles,
a language of light,
a counsel of shadows.
I find solace here,
in the heart of the green,
in the embrace of earth,
every breath a blessing,
every moment a gift.
Nature holds me close,
a mother of all things,
as I rediscover
who I am.
