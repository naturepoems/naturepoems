All through the fields of wheat,
the waves are dreams woven,
a golden fabric spun
by the sun itself.
I blow, I wave,
a tranquil sea.
And you, wind, ride me,
you together with the whole
live dance of colors.
Together we are the earthâ€™s laughter,
the cry of seeds sprouting into life.

- Vicente Aleixandre
