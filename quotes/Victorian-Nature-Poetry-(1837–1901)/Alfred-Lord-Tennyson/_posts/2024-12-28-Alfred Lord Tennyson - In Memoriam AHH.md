In Memoriam A.H.H. (Excerpt)

O that 'twere possible
After long grief and pain,
To find the arms of my true love
And hug them close again.

In the woods, the trees are swaying,
And the squirrels leap and play,
To them nature's voice is saying:
'Verily joys are here to stay.'

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
