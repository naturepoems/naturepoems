Each morning, the sun rises,  
a golden orb of hope,  
illuminating the path  
for the wanderers.  
The earth stirs awake,  
shaking off night's chill,  
preparing for the dance  
of life anew.  

Fields stretch like smiles,  
a chorus of colors,  
while petals unfurl  
in a delicate display,  
a reminder to cherish  
the beauty of each moment.

- Gino Bartali
