The Pink Dogwood
The splendid pink of bloom—a life that sways
In a tremulous dance on the bough,  
But never that subdued,  
The glory and grace of the open blue skies.
Each leaf a hymn, as the wind calls the tune,  
This is why,  
The flowering fades, but never departs.
O Dogwood!  A promise kept with every season.

- Amy Lowell
