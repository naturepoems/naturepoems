To the Light

Brilliant light, 
Look down, see the curves 
And angles of petals,
Serpentine and bright. 

You give life to the tangle,
You breathe spark through the thickets,
Your warming fingers 
Unfurl the tapestries of green.

You coax shadows to dance,
You hold the sun in your grasp, 
Enlighten us all, 
Give bird and bough their fill. 

Oh Light, my muse, 
Let the world shimmer 
In the embrace of your warmth, 
Let me rise with the dawn.
