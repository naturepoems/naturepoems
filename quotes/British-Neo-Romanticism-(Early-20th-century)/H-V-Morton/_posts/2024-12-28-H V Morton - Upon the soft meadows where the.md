Upon the soft meadows where the wildflowers sway,
In the kiss of the breeze, let your worries decay.
For in the heart of the earth, where the green grasses grow,
A sanctuary whispers, where only love flows.

As clouds drift like dreams over valleys of gold,
In the dance of the day, let your stories unfold.
Each moment that passes, like petals they fall,
In the stillness of nature, we hear nature's call.

The streams carve their pathways, through rocks and the trees,
In their playful little journeys, they hum to the breeze.
Each ripple a lifetime, each wave a new song,
In the arms of creation, where we all belong.

So letâ€™s wander in wonder, beneath wide open skies,
With the stars as our witnesses, and the moonlight our guide.
For in nature's sweet canvas, etched with love's grace,
We find the pure echoes of our rightful place.

- H V Morton
