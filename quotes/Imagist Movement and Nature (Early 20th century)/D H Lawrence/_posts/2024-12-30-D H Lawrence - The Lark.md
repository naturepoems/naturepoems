The Lark

   The lark sings out at dawn,
   cascading torrents of sweet birdsong,
   rapturous offerings of smeared hues,
   luxuriance of sun, where nature shines,
   buried deep, awakened at the dawn.

   So high above, the screech remains,
   a voicing that once known can never forget,
   a flower drives the season afresh,
   inviting me quietly back to earth.


- D H Lawrence
