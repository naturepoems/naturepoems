A garden blooms beneath the stars,
a constellation of petals and dew,
where shadows linger in the corners,
and hidden stories slip from their roots,
a language taught by the earth.

The moon casts its silver net,
a fisherman collecting the whispers of the night,
dragging home the fragrances of jasmine,
all secrets tied in the knots of vine,
at once tender and wild.

And i shall kneel,
feeling the cool embrace of soil,
as the tendrils of life curl around my fingers,
each touch a reminder, a breath,
of the wildness that flourishes,
untamed yet nestled close to our hearts.

- Lucio Piccolo
