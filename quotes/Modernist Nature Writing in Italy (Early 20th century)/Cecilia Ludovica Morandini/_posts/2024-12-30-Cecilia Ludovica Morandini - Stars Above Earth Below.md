Stars Above, Earth Below

In the embrace of night,
we gaze at the stars,
twinkling like distant secrets,
a cosmic dance of light and shadow.
Below, the earth stirs softly,
a blanket of dreams and histories,
a reminder of the dance we share,
our footsteps tracing paths through time.

Each star a heartbeat,
a note in nature's song,
each breath we take,
intertwined with the universe,
as we stand alone, together,
under the vast, infinite sky.

- Cecilia Ludovica Morandini
