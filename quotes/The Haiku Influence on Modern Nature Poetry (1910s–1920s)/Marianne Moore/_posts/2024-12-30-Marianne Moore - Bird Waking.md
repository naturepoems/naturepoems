Bird Waking

Some birds, without a doubt,
learn singing through a silty mist,
daybreak threads; the dappled tone,crescendo with softness.
From need of shelter above mere trees,
plunging exams of air,
they deflate their beaks,
noted like plants arriving,
to ask timefold moments;
a contact of both feathered winds,
lowering chokes from nature's have,
knocking light's coals,
a hue you've shaped, who remains,
dancing wasted paralleling grass.

Yet they remain small,
a wonderspassing glance,
even sometimes those there,
needs the legacies of tree,
waving at them; as holds questions,  
each adamant once formed,
upon such distance,
recollected—and weave,
to the dew of beginnings.

- Marianne Moore
