The sky a canvas,
blue and alive,
a patchwork of clouds,
stray thoughts drifting,
as the sun stretches,
widening its golden embrace.

Mountains stand firm,
ancient giants,
earthing their strength,
while rivers laugh
over rocks,
a song of persistence
flowing ever onward.

Nature teaches,
never learned,
a language reborn
each season,
a letter, a leaf,
a vibrant proof
of celestial design,
whispering
of eternity.

Let me be quiet here,
in this serene cauldron,
and weave my dreams
into the air,
a tapestry of nature,
a Dadaist crescendo
of wild abandon,
a tribute to existence.

- Alice Toklas
