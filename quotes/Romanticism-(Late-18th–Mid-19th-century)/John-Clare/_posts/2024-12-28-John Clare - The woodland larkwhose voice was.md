The woodland lark—whose voice was tame—
The echoes of my childhood rang again:  
With smiles of curled-brown leaves that fell like rain,
And played like music when I called its name.

I dreamt the rams of night within their course—
The pleasant vale stretched far as I could see,
With liquid silver streams, and fragrant trees
That bowed beneath the light upon its source.

With every dream a lark sang in my ear—
Light wafted forth long paths of joy entwined,
Whose sounds came back from childhood sweet and clear:
Those woodland woods that once the lark did find.
