Oh, to be a bird, in a sky vast and blue,
With wings stretched wide, a freedom untamed;
To ride the winds, chase horizons unknown,
In nature's embrace, never be constrained.

Each sunrise a canvas for colors to bleed,
Each sunset a promise that all will return;
In this cycle of life, rich and profound,
I yearn for the solace of heartwood and fern.

- Sigbjørn Obstfelder
