The Night Sky
Oh, what a tapestry the night unveils,
Stars twinkle like thoughts in the void,
Across the canvas of forever,
Each point a whisper, a promise,
The moon sails high, a silver ship,
Charting the depths of solitude,
As the world slips into dreams,
And the night cradles every heartbeat,
In the silence vast and deep.


- John Gould Fletcher
