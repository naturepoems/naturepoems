The starry night, the moonlit sea,
Remind me of the world up high,
Where every thought and memory
Will linger long as time goes by.

In shadows under ancient trees,
The wisdom of the night is found,
And all the radiance seems to please,
As softly drifts the night-time sound.

So come dear night to be my friend,
For nature wraps me in her cares,
And every fleeting moment shall blend,
To fill my heart with silent prayers.

- AE Housman
