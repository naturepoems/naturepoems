The Buried Life

Light flows our war of mocking words,  
And we are justly fair,  
Still taking flight the unknown third,  
Then space is warm, but we must dare  
And feel our fingers trace the sky.  
O dreamer lost, but let us breathe  
The tender air of love come by  
And blend as one where echoes weave.  

What room is there for plight of men,  
The thought to come breathe dark?  
Ah! it seems our lot must then  
Take heart to share the sound of spark;  
Though chastened heart, the strain in rest,  
Yet happiness out-reach the realm.  
Of time defined, in Pause bestowed,  
Within all stillness is the helm.  

So let us sink into the dry,  
In loveâ€™s eternal place till free;  
And while the warmth unfolds on high,  
From sanctum sleep, to wave at sea.  
And though we pass the fall away,  
The orchard waits where joys of sway  
Rise past the fateful roundelay,  
To dance alone through night and day!


- Matthew Arnold
