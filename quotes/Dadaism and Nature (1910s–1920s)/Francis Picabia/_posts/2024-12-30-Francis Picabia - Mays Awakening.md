May's Awakening
When May peeks through the window,
she carries the scent of blossoms,
a wild sprinkle of colors—
often joyous, sometimes coy.

Bouquets of chaos adorn the earth
as if nature herself is a painter,
splashing exhilaration,
a tapestry woven from laughter
and unbridled ecstasy,
echoing the promise of warmth.


- Francis Picabia
