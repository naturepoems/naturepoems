Morning Glory

The sun peeks over the horizon,
a tender touch on the sleeping world,
a blush of light enveloping,
a soft awakening of life.

The dew glistens,
a myriad of diamonds,
a celebration in silence,
a reminder of the beauty in moments,
fragments unfolding slowly.

With the dawn, hope rises,
a promise, like a bloom,
vibrant and alive,
in every shade of renewal.

- Yvan Goll
