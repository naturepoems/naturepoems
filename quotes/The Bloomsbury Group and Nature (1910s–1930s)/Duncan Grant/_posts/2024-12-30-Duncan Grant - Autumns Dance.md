The autumn leaves, a fiery blaze,
As trees shed tears of gold and red,
In their descent, they twirl and sway,
A dance of life, of love long spread.

Each crunch beneath a step taken,
A reminder of seasons turning,
In nature's loss, new life is shaken,
To rise again, forever yearning.

- Duncan Grant
