Dance of the Flames

In the heart of the wild, a fire does gleam,
It dances and flickers, a traveler’s dream,
Stories of warmth, of comfort and light,
Unveiling the secrets of the starry night.

As embers spark in the dark, they soar,
Echoing tales from the days of yore,
Nature’s own canvas, painted bright,
In the embrace of the dying light.

- David C Okwuosa
