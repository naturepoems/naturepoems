Emerald forests cloak the day,
Winds weave their fingers in gentle play.
Through the branches, sunlight streams,
In the heart of woodlands, nature dreams.

Moss carpets the ground with a lush green hush,
The world slows down in a tranquil rush.
Every rustle tells a story untold,
In the dance of ages, forever bold.

- Mariano Fortuny
