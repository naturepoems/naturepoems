A sudden blue—a stillness, and a flood  
Of sweetness, shining like the sea,  
Is in the air—the golden woods are free,  
And all the world is waiting, as if God  
Had drawn aside the veil of dreams, that we  
Might drift as slowly as we will through blood  
And root and leaf and petal, heart and wood,  
And share the glory of eternity.

- Bliss Carmen
