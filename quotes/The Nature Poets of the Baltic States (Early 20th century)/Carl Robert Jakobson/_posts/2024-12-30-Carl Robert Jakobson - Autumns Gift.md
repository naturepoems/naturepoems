Autumn's Gift  
Crimson and gold,  
in the twilight's caress,  
leaves fall like whispers  
a dance in the press.  
The air turns crisp  
a heralding sigh, nthe bounty of nature  
under the vast sky.  
As the world finds its rest,  
in the harvest's sweet embrace,  
a circle of life  
in the fading grace.

- Carl Robert Jakobson
