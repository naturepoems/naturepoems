Echo
in the canopy of trees,
your laugh is an echo,
softer than whispers,
a song glides on the branches,
followed by shimmering lights in twilight.

your breath will break the shackles of sameness,
a prayer wreathed in golden leaves,
ending where it begins,
underneath the sunlit silence,
waiting for the surge of storm. 

Anne Waldman
