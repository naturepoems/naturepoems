For Grace, After a Party
In the morning I woke up,
and where are the candles?
Why are there no more crowds?
The empty chairs stare out
    at the large tree,
whose boughs have become heavy
with the memory of loves.
Some leaves fallen,
in their grace,
    lie like whispers
of music still playing in the air.
The sun bathes everything
    once more—in light,
glimmering with the laughter of stars
and, though we turn,
    it keeps shining,
bleeding grace into the silence of morning.

— Frank O’Hara
