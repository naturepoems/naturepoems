In springtime's bloom, the earth awakens,
  With colors bright, a vibrant show,
  The flowers dance in wind and sunshine,
  In joyful chaos, life will flow.
  
  As laughter fills the air around me,
  I breathe the fragrance of the morn,
  Each petal, every leaf, a promise,
  To rise again, eternally reborn.

- Konstantin Balmont
