A storm brews in the distance,
Dark clouds gather overhead,
Nature’s force in a symphony,
A rumble like distant drums.

The trees sway and dance,
Roots deep in the soil’s hold,
They whisper to each other,
In a language of the wild.

As the first drops begin to fall,
I feel the pulse of the earth,
Alive with electric energy,
A reminder of the power,
That flows through all of us.

- Richard Wright
