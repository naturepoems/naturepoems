Autumn

The trees are shedding their golden crowns,  
Their leaves light spiral down,  
Upon the earth, a carpet, soft,  
A quiet, resting town.

In the coolness, shadows dwell,  
And whispers ride the airs;  
The harvest yields its fruits, reveals  
The bounty of our cares.

O Autumn! Find in Natureâ€™s chest  
The warmth you left behind;  
And in each breath, a wistful quest  
That lingers in the mind.

- Alphonse de Lamartine
