A Dream

I dreamed a dream that fled from me,
Up to the sky’s long and shadowed part,
And where the flowers bend to set me free,
Wherever I heard but a trembling heart.

And I felt in all clouds, the wings of flight;
As songs sung high into rolls, uncharge-able—a sound of night—
In all the orange sky from dusk return,—
For from love has filled while long the stars of the sun.

For I have dreamed where all turned meek and bright,
And I beheld the glance infinitely seen;
Through deep the light shall whisper when its bright,
Where me heads my own lot of what has always been!

For joy alone shall fire each glance on their name;
And out of this burning comes brighter the rank ensued—
For the folds must behold and never give blame,
As dreams run deep into a heart of fecund elude!

- John Masefield
