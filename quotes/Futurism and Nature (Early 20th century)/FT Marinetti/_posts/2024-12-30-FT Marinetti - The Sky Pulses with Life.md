O the sky, the pulsing sky!
With colors in a whirlwind,
It trembles above the landscape,
Its breath burns in misty waves.

Let us hurl ourselves at the grass,
And let the rivers whistle joyfully,
Like a symphony,- mechanical, yet wild,
Fusing fluid music with vibrant reflections.

These structures of granite and steel
Arise amidst the sacred chorus —
They sing with the pulse of machines,
Deep within the veins of nature’s metamorphosis.

O beautiful wildness!  
With rhythm and with charm!  
Our metal will conquer,
Sculpting fierce dreams from the clay of Earth!

- FT Marinetti
