Nightfall

At dusk when the stars embrace the dark,
   And the moonlight breathes its silvery hush,
The whispers of crickets in shadows mark,
   As night draws in without a rush.

The leaves dimmed by the coming night
   Talk softly in their rustling flight,
Under the canopy, calm and clear,
   Where the world sleeps with nothing to fear.


- Richard Aldington
