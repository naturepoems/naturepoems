Trees
by W. S. Merwin

We planted trees
In distant thoughts and dreams,
Yet it is in their shade we learn
To breathe again, amidst soft whispers.
They straighten and reach,
Revealing the world as they sing,
Bringing back the lovely days
Where we pledge to the earth,
Humble in that quiet trust.

- W S Merwin
