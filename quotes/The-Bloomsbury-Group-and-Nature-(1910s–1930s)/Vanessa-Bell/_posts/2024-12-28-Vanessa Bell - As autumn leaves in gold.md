As autumn leaves in gold descend,
The whisper of a coming frost,
Nature’s palette, dull and vibrant blend,
In her embrace, no moment's lost.

The air is crisp, a herald's song,
Of seasons changing, hearts transformed,
In nature’s cycle, we belong,
Through every shift, our spirits warmed.

- Vanessa Bell
