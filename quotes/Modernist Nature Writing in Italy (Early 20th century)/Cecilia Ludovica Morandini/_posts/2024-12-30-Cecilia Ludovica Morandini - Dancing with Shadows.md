Dancing with Shadows

Among the rustling leaves,
shadows play hide and seek,
stretching into the unknown,
weaving tales of light and dark.
Sunbeams pierce through branches,
painting patterns on the ground,
while whispers of the wind
carry secrets carried far.

Embraced by the wild,
we dance with shadows,
a waltz of ephemeral grace,
where time stands still,
and the forest becomes a labyrinth
for wandering hearts,
seeking solace beneath the boughs.

- Cecilia Ludovica Morandini
