Birches
When I see birches bend to left and right
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,
I like to think some boy's been swinging them.
But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.
...

Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crustâ€”
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.

They are dragged to the withered limb
That if I lost it when I was young
I hung my ancient sorrow on it,
And I will not forget her rays.

The boys are saying, "The trees have gone wild!"
But against the bark I will plant my own hands,
And swing myself to break their caterpillars' autumn sky.

- Robert Frost
