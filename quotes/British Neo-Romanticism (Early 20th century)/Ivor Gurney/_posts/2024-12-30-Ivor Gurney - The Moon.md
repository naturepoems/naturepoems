The Moon

                     I have seen the moon so bright,
                     Hanging low above the wood.
                     I have watched it twist and glint,
                     On silver streams and clouded night.
                     
                     Here is the world of dreams and flight,
                     Where gentle glimmers softly tread.
                     It winks at me, flirts with my skin,
                     In shadows, swift, it bides instead.
                     
                     O fair moon, you call the winder hours
                     To weave a tale of truths unclear,
                     How trees bend low to kiss the earth,
                     They whisper secrets, none can hear.
                     
                     Oh, let the dawn light tread so sweet,
                     On all the paths where contemplations meet,
                     For I have seen you weave first love,
                     Into the silk of dusk's embrace.
