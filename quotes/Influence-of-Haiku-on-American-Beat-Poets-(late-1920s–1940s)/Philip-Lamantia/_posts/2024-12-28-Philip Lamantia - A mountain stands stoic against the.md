quote: "A mountain stands stoic against the sky,  
Its peaks dive into clouds like thoughts unformed,  
A kingdom of stone where echoes linger,  
And a lone bird, a messenger of dreams,  
Soars with wings of freedom and grace."

A mountain stands stoic against the sky,  
Its peaks dive into clouds like thoughts unformed,  
A kingdom of stone where echoes linger,  
And a lone bird, a messenger of dreams,  
Soars with wings of freedom and grace.
