The autumn night is dark and dense,
   The moonlight scarce can break;
Why should I toil on, drifting hence,
   And while my heart's awake?
Though everywhere is a tang of scent,
   Of crispness in the air,
This lonesome bud lest it should rent,
   Who waits for summer fair; 
In the midst of silence I'm alone in the night,
   Shield me with silence, void of pain;
Tell how long I shall stave in the light,
   How long 'til love attain.

- Robert Browning
