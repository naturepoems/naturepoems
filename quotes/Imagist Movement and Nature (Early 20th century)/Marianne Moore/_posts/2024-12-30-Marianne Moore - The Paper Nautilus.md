The Paper Nautilus

The paper nautilus, which
is like a polished shell,
    a sort of crystal cup,
    shallow, invisible, built
on the experiencing of life.
    It is the only encasement
    it can create or find
    from the ocean’s arms.

This creature’s beauty is itself
    and its admirers’ admiration
is not so much for its charm.
The lines and curves leave us
    voiceless as we watch,
    inspired by natural wonder:  
    a fool’s gold-worth.

What it makes is better for us
    than ourselves; we 
    can float it in water;
    a perfect nesting place.
