The Heart of the Earth

Oh, where do I find each dear embrace,
That springs from the heart of the Earth so wide?
For each little creature’s thronging place,
Is where life's abode shall ever bide.

And the mountains loom with pride and grace,
While flowers bloom bright within verdant folds,
As the song of the winds trace delicate lace
In whispers that tell of the dreams of old.

So I wander through creeks and the tussock paths,
And I dance to the river's gentle tide,
Embraced by the essence of nature's paths,
In that deep calm wherein one confides.

So I hold this land within my chest,
As the heart beats louder ‘neath brilliant skies,
For the spirit of earth is the truest test,
In the dance of joy where the soul lies.

- Banjo Paterson
