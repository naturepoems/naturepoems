THE SLEEPING BEAUTY

In summer's glow, where flowers brightly bloom,  
A beauty sleeps beneath the willow's shade;  
Whispers of breezes 'round her softly loom,  
As if to guard, with tender hands, her gaze.  
Each petal’s fall keeps silent, softly swayed,  
Dreams woven through a tapestry so fair:  
Nature’s breath, or reveries of sweet despair?  
In dreams of youth, the future glows anew,  
Resting by the waters, lost to time's embrace.


- Walter Deverell
