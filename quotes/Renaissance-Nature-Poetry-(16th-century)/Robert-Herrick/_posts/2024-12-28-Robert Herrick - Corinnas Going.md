Corinna’s Going A-Maying

Get up, get up for shame! The dew doth wet thy hay;
Fear not to thrust thy head; we will be in today.

Now while the world is turned to glass,
Let’s run into the green, and let the morning pass.
The flowers who’re out in bloom this morn
Will catch our hearts as they are worn.

Then let us sing beneath the trees,
And dance through fields with jolly ease;
The morn invites us to delight,
In nature’s beauty, pure and bright.

- Robert Herrick
