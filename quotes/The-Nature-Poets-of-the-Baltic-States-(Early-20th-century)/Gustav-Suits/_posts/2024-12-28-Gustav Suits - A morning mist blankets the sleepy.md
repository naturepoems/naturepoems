A morning mist blankets the sleepy glade,
where dewdrops glisten, like diamonds arrayed.
The lark's joyful trill breaks the silence once made,
announcing the dawn, where shadows do fade.

Through thickets and briars, the path winds anew,
and blossoms unfold in a radiant hue.
Each petal a whisper of secrets they share,
with bees gathering nectar, sweet life in the air.


- Gustav Suits
