Oh, heart of Nature, wide and free,
In every leaf, each joy concealed;
The crystal drops that on the tree,
In whispers soft, will be revealed.

The sun-kissed fields, the azure skies,
Are woven into nature's dream;
By rivers deep and laughter flies,
Are precious in the golden beam.

'Tis here I find my peace, my breath,
In every trail, where wild winds invite,
In life, in death, a deeper depth,
A solace in the quiet night.

- James Russell Lowell
