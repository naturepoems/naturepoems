Infant Joy  

“I have no name  
I am but two days old.”  
“What shall I call thee?”  
“I happy am,  
Joy is my name.”  
“Sweet joy befall thee!  
Pretty joy!”  
“Welcome, welcome!  
To my Heart!”  

“But, I will stay with you  
Whether the sun shines upon you,  
Or the moon behind the stars.”  

I wish to share joy's delight,  
With every living breath,  
With the spirit of beauty bright,  
And in his dark grave, much death.

- William Blake
