Sonnet 1
Since there’s no help, come let us kiss and part.
Nay, I have done, you get no more of me;
And I am glad, yea, glad I’m rid of thee.
For having thee, of thee I could not part.

But, I must go, and I will go, I must,
And if I go let me; else I am undone.
And so farewell; for I must leave thee now,
If I wear anything, thou’lt be the worse for me.

Yet I would be thy love; but, now I part,
And having done, I shall be free; and free
I’ll be to seek the world and live to thee
In time that I shall see thee as my heart.

So let us go; for as thou dost not see
My quick resolve, I bid thee hearts—and part!



- Michael Drayton
