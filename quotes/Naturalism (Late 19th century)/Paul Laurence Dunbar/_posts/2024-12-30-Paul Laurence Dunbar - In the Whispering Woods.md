The forest whispers secrets old,  
In tales of those who learned and told.  
Each rustling leaf, each creaking bough,  
Speaks of the past alive right now.  

In harmony where creatures roam,  
The woods invite all souls back home.  
Embrace the shade, breathe deep the air,  
In natureâ€™s heart, find solace there.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
