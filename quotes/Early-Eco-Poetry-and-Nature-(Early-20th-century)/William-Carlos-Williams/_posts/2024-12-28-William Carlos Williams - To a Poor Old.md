To a Poor Old Woman

Munching a apricot

like a great

butterfly

of summer

with consumer’s

cravings

and a sense

of the residual

and the moment it

goes — this is

celestial.

both sweet and tart

offers a feeling

of golden hours.

Oh to be blessed

with these earthly

nourishments!


- William Carlos Williams
