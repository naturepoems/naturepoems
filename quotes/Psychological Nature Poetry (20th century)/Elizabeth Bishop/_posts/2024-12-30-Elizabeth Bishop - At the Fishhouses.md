At the Fishhouses

In the cold, cold sea,
there are fish houses.
The doors are open, and the small
fresh fish are hanging,
glistening with the dew,
while the great fishermen
who know the phosphorescence
like a starry ocean
of distant storms,
breathe deeply of the salt air.

This way you can tell
the past from the present,
one is the weight of the fish,
the other the weight of the sea.
