The mountain air, so pure, so clear,
Cascades down valleys with a song,
Where every note refrains from fear,
And all is right where hearts belong.

The echoes of the distant stream,
Winding around the stones so strong,
In nature's embrace, I dream, I gleam,
Alive, together with the throng.


- F W Harvey
