The Woods

When shadows play in the quiet woods, 
With secrets hidden in gentle floods, 
Where every whisper of a breeze, 
Brings forth the song of the earth at ease.

The towering trees hold timeless grace, 
As tender blooms embrace their space; 
A choir of life, both meek and wild, 
In nature's womb, like a waiting child.

So wander forth, through sylvan trails, 
With every heartbeat, the spirit exhales; 
In this refuge, let spirits wake, 
For every heartbeat, the woods shall take.

- James Elroy Flecker
