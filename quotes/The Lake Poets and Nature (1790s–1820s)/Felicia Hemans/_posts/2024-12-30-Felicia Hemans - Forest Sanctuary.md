Forest Sanctuary
O living Atoms! it is you
Who weave the green and the blue,
Who crown the fruits of the trees,
And thrill their leaves in the breeze!

The heart of Nature beats in tune,
With all her whispering magic, June,
While sweetly sings the hidden brook,
Among the leaves of shady nook.

- Felicia Hemans
