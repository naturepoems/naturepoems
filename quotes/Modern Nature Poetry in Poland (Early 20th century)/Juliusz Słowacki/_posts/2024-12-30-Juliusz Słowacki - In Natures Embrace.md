Oceans vast and mountains high,
Boundless horizons where eagles fly.
In nature's arms, my spirit soars,
As waves crash and the thunder roars.

The echoes of the wilderness call,
In their embrace, I lose it all.
The rustling leaves, the distant storms,
A symphony of nature's forms.

Through valleys lush and rivers wide,
I seek the truth where the wild things hide.
For in this dance of chaos and peace,
I find a quiet, yet wild release.


- Juliusz Słowacki
