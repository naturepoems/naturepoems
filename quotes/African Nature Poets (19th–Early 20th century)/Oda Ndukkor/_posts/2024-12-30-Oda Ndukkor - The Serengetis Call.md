The Serengeti's Call
Across the plains where the wild winds blow,
The pulse of Africa, a heartbeat slow.
Under the sun’s golden gaze,
The land awakens, a fiery blaze.

Wildebeests thunder, a stampede of soul,
While lions roar, taking their toll.
Majestic beauty, raw and free,
The Serengeti sings a song to me.


- Oda Ndukkor
