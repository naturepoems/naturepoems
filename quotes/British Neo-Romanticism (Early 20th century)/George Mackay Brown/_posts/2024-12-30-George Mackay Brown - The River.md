The River

I take my solace in the river,
The soft gurgle and ripples,
Cool to the touch, refreshing.
And starlings hover and swoop,
Their shadows flickering on water.

Now the grey clouds gather,
And rain falls silently into the deep,
Mixing with emerald greens, and browns
Of the water lily, wild and free,
In the gentle caress of the worldâ€™s murmuring.


- George Mackay Brown
