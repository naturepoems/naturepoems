The Idea of Order at Key West

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind
Of matter, only in a raised sun
And the flow of dusk behind the brink
Of the profound abyss of divine.

Her subject, utterly serene,
Charmed an entire night of sky,
And from her came a wakened dream
Of the eternal night's scintillate,
Creating that soft, smiling tide.

The glassy surf and the phosphorous sea
Born from her voice, move in the clouds
Of someone lost we’ll never see,
And all are called to listen there.

With only the sound and the taste of that song,
Which spoke of light and darkness intertwined,
All creatures arise to breathe those notes,
Framed in the endlessness beyond.

All have changed to become like she
In a simple tone of epiphany—
The torrent of the sea falls away
Into the distance of solitary space,
Made whole, transformed, by a woman’s dream.

And yet, the songs continue, unrecalled.
No heart remembers the glory heard,
As in silence leaving all to flow.
Yet one can know, forever, what was sung.

- Wallace Stevens
