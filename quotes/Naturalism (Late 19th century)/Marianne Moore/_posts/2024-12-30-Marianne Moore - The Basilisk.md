The Basilisk
In the small desert  
The basilisk emerges  
In the dayâ€™s warmth,  
Skin upon sand  
Keeps its distance,  
Wary and watchful.

Drawing near, I witness  
The vivid color,  
Green like a dream,  
Where he seems to dwell  
In the throbbing dust,  
Gentling into the world.


- Marianne Moore
