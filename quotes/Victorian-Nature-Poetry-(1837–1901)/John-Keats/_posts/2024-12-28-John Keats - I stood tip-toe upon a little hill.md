I stood tip-toe upon a little hill, 
The air was cool, and pleasantly yet chill; 
And as I looked, I saw bright colours blend— 
The darkened leaves and woodlands in the glen, 
Como that red earth told of sadness; still, 
I gazed upon the tree, whose wish did not rescind, 
How green and ripe the nut was ready; such a gift, 
And though the dusk began its heavy slow descent, 
I felt its beauty, nature's still unbent— 
Intact like throbbing chords, when understood did thrill.

- John Keats
