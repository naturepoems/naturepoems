The river bends, a silver thread,
 Through valleys deep, where dreams are fed.
 It whispers soft to rocks and sand,
 The harmony of water and land.

 Each ripple tells a story true,
 Of mountains high and skies of blue,
 In flowing grace, the earth’s own breath,
 A journey boundless, beyond death.


- Roger Fry
