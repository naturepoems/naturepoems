The Grasshopper and the Cricket  
The poetry of earth is never dead:  
When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,  
And hiding in the shady leaves, just one,  
Eagerly hopping on one leg, he talks  
Of peace and strife and love, while crickets sing,  
The evening chorus, as the dusk begins.  
In peace, the world abides; the artisanal  
Properties of Nature, in cycles ever new,  
Breathes life into the living drama of sense.

- Leigh Hunt
