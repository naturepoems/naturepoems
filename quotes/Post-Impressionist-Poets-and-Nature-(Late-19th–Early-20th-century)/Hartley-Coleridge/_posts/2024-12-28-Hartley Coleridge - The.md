The Garden
A garden blooms with colors bright,
Where every petal sings a tune;
The fragrance lifts, a pure delight,
As bees enchant the afternoon.
In this embrace of nature’s hand,
Life flourishes in vibrant hue;
In every leaf, a love so grand,
The garden whispers, ‘I love you.’

- Hartley Coleridge
