The Forest Glade
 
In the stillness of the wood,  
Where light and shadow softly play,  
The ancient trees, with wisdom stood,  
Whisper secrets of the day.  

A carpet green beneath my feet,  
With flowers blooming wild and free,  
The melodies of life repeat,  
In nature’s vast tranquility.

- Edward Burne-Jones
