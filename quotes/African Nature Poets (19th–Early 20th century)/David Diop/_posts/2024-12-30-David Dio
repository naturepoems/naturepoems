The Heartbeat of the Earth
  
Oh, the heartbeat of the earth,
  
A resonant drum that awakens
  
With every pulse beneath our feet,
  
Every whisper of the wind.
  
    
Feel its rhythm in the forests,
  
In the rustling of leaves,
  
In the chorus of the wild,
  
And the songs of ancient trees.
  
    
Every crack of thunder, a heartbeat,
  
Every raindrop and every bloom,
  
A testament to the life that thrives,
  
In the embrace of nature’s womb.
  
    
Oh, how nature sings to us,
  
With a voice both fierce and tender,
  
Teaching us to listen, to cherish
  
The sacred bond we all share.
  
    
For in the heartbeat of the earth,
  
We find our roots, our truth,
  
In the pulse of life that connects us,
  
A legacy of love and unity.

- David Diop
