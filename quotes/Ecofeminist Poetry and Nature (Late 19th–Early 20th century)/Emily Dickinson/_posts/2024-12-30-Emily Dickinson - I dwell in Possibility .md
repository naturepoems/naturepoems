I dwell in Possibility –  
A fairer House than Prose –  
More numerous of Windows –  
Superior – for Doors –  

Of Chambers as the Cedars –  
Impregnable of Eye –  
And there – a百th of Greatness  
Nor less – is heard,  

And each – new Drummer’s Lure  
Upon the open sun –  
As far as the spark of a Word,  
For lost Chasms of Love!  


- Emily Dickinson
