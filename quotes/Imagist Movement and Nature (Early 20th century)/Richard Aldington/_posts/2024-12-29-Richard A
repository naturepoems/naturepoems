On the Mountain

On the mountain, the world is grand,    
Where silence weaves the air so clear;    
With skies that stretch on high demand,    
Natureâ€™s breath, a hymn to hear.

The trails of thought among the stones,    
Here, dreams are writ in silent verse;    
Each step a line that softly groans,    
Each whisper, nature's gentle curse.


- Richard Aldington
