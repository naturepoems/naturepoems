Hummingbird

In the darkest of times,  
a hummingbird flows,  
a sweet burst of color  
pulses through the air—  
business like a busy day,  
watering without worry,  
taking flight into the sweet,  
deep sunlit reaches,  
its heart alight—  
what would we be without  
such pure beauty,  
such song?  
Let us breathe it in,  
and in return give back  
the turmoil of our hearts,  
a pocket of a silent prayer.

- Mary Oliver
