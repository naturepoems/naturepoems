quote: "In the bare fields, late winter light falls, 
Shimmering shadows on darkened soil, 
A deer pauses, gazing towards the horizon, 
And though the world seems quiet, it speaks, 
A moment held, fragile yet full of grace."

In the bare fields, late winter light falls, 
Shimmering shadows on darkened soil, 
A deer pauses, gazing towards the horizon, 
And though the world seems quiet, it speaks, 
A moment held, fragile yet full of grace.

- James Wright
