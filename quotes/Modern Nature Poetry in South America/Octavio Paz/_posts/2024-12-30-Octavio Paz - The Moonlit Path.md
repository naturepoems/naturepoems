In the night, a moonlit path,
a guide through the forest,
trees cloaked in silver,
a silent embrace of dreams,
nature woven into the fabric of being.

With each heartbeat,
the world pulses,
lifeâ€™s song echoes,
a chorus of existence,
reminding us of all
that grows and withers and lives.

- Octavio Paz
