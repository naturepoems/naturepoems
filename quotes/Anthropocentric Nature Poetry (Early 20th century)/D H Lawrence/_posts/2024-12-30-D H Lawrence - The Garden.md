The Garden

In my garden, small and wild,
Dance the shadows of sunlit leaves,
Whispers of blooming petals
That laugh against the backdrop,
Where bees buzz solemn songs
And the air is thick with scents,
A heady mix of earth, and life,
A stirring of passions set free.

Each blade of grass a memory,
Each flower a delicate truth,
The sun blazes a trail,
Caressing the dusky morning
As the dew kisses my skin,
And I surrender to the beauty,
A quiet to my restless soul,
In this sacred space of nature,
Where chaos dances with calm.

- D H Lawrence
