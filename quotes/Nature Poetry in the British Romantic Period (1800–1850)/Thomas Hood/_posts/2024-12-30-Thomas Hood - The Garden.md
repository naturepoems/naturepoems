The Garden  

Through the tender vines and leaves,  
Through the cheerful blooms of light,  
Where every breeze a burden weaves,  
There sweet blossoms take their flight.  

A dance of shadows round the sun,  
The flowers nodding, bright and fair,  
Life and love to look upon,  
Life and love that wander there.  

Bring the joy of summer's eve,  
When shades and colors meet together—  
Where the heart is free to grieve  
‘Neath the golden, open weather!

- Thomas Hood
