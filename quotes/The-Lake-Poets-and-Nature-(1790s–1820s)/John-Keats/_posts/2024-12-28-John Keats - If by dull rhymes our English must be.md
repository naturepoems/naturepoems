If by dull rhymes our English must be chained,
And, like Andromeda, tied to a rock,
We’ll cry aloud, and throw the chains away,
And this [they] saying shall un-hue

With gold and music more than silver shell—
Across the echo void, and trees  un-plained;
For trees only wear no less wreath of Alpine song,
And endings so peace remain; each place filled with deep colors of hurt and hope.

*From "The Eve of St. Agnes"*

- John Keats
