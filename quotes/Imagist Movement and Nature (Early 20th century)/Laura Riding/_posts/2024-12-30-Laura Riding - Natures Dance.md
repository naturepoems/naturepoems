Generous beneath the ferns,
Shadows give way to softness;
Among the dirt trails scattered,
Golden drops come racing down—
With every ray, light dances,
Echoes through branches intertwined,
Over mossy patches, its hue bright, 
And a blush from a flower reaches into uncharted,  
Awaiting the touch of sunlight; 
Breath in the circle bends, 
Find those points where veils may shimmer,
Between expectancy and relief—
A dance that speaks into the softness of life,
A weave that finds each thread, creating sequins of time.
