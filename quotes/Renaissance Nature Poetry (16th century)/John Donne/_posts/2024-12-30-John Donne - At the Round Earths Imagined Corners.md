At the Round Earth’s Imagined Corners

At the round earth’s imagined corners, blow
Your trumpets, angels, and arise, arise
From death, you numberless infinities
Of Souls that Strain, in this frail, mortal night!

‘Your sound waves shall gather forth me here—
Musical chimes can claim from symmetry
The vast horizons of creation near,
In answering Nature composed with thee!

Rest your angelic fulgurant light
Of scepters thrown to worlds almost unheard;
Shall I breach a rest for you again that might
Sound the very echo, for me unheard?

O, let me go; when may my eye behold?
To bind us in the flow we share, afar
Each soul cast wild on a foamy fold
Grasping at the farthest of unseen stars.

Beleaguer to the source—O mortal breath,
Within the ether move to claim the dawn,
Let this spring dawn forth, and dance the death,
Your grandeur’s call keeps truth alive until we're drawn!

- John Donne
