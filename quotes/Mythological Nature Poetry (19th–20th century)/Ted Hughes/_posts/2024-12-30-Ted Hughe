The Deer

Forest treetops sighing  
   above me—  
   everything breathes, and  
   in the still depths of thicket  
   the deer emerges. 
   I followed,  
   moving closer, 
   light beating along with their hearts;  
   their eyes bright like wild starbursts.

They weave between the shadows,  
   forgotten spirits  
   of the earth under moonlight,  
   drifting at will through pale mist,  
   touching the full depths of life’s secret.

- Ted Hughes
