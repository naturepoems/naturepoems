In the heart of the night,
The moon spills silver upon the stream,
And crickets compose their symphonies,
While the wild flowers bend lightly,
In gratitude for the touch of the wind,
For nothing is ordinary
In this tapestry of life,
Kaleidoscopes flickering with potential.

There lies beauty in the mess,
In nature's refuse and remnants,
In the gravel and the growth,
In mingled laughter and sighs.

- Paul Éluard
