In the heart of the winter night,
Where the frost lies thick upon the earth,
I wander through the hush of snow,
Each step a crackling soft whisper.

The stars, like diamonds, glitter above,
And I am wrapped in their silent glow,
In this stillness, I lose myself,
As the world holds its breath,
Waiting for the warmth of spring to stir.

- Richard Aldington
