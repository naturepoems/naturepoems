The Garden of the Hesperides

In the dreaming garden of the sun, 
Where fields of violet bloom, 
Dare kisses born of the drowsing breeze, 
And countless pleasures loom.

Eden rests on the olive nigh, 
With golden fruit in hand, 
Where all the world in sweet reply, 
Will come to understand.

Softly wander in the light, 
And seek the fare of dew, 
Where every petal caught in blight, 
Will rise with fragrance true.

For in this garden, sacred and rare, 
The souls of nature thrive, 
And in your heart, believe it fair, 
The beauty sings alive.

So take my hand as shadows blend, 
Let names and echoes hide, 
In every flower, your heart defend, 
Join me in whispers, shining wide.

- James Elroy Flecker
