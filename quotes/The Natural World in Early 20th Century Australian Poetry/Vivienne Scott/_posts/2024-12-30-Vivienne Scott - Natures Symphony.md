In the clamor of the wild and free,  
A symphony crafted by earth’s decree,  
With each rustle, a melody sung,  
In nature's arms, we’ve all begun.

To listen, to feel, to understand,  
The pulse of life in every land,  
In the rustling leaves, in the softest sigh,  
Nature speaks, and we reply.


- Vivienne Scott
