In the twilight hush,
a whisper rides,
the scent of blooming jasmine,
twined with the heartbeat
of the evening.
Stars appear,
little gems cast
like thoughts scattered,
into a velvet sky.

The moon nudges the waves,
a celestial play,
a shimmering dance
upon the breath of night.
Trees stand, guardians
to the secrets of the dusk,
noble silhouettes,
holding notions of dreams.

All that breathes
in the night,
a luxuriant pulse,
a rhythm intertwined,
with the soft touch
of the breeze:
we are one,
in this grand ballet.

Illuminate the silence,
as life, forever,
cradles a moment,
in the blend of shadows
and light,
a fragile existence,
a fragile beauty.

- Alice Toklas
