quote: "Autumn Leaves  
    The autumn leaves tumble down,  
    Rainbow dancers in a breeze.  
    Golden, crimson, russet gowns,  
    Swirling down from hallowed trees.  

    Each leaves a story behind,  
    A memory of summer’s glow—  
    Nature's breath can be so kind,  
    In the swirling, soft tableau."

Autumn Leaves  
    The autumn leaves tumble down,  
    Rainbow dancers in a breeze.  
    Golden, crimson, russet gowns,  
    Swirling down from hallowed trees.  

    Each leaves a story behind,  
    A memory of summer’s glow—  
    Nature's breath can be so kind,  
    In the swirling, soft tableau.
