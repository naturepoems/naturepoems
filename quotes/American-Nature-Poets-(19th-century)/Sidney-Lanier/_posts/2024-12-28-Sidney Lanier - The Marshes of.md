The Marshes of Glynn

By Sidney Lanier

I
Along the edge of the marshes, where the red-
     memed sun
Droops down in the west, a city,
     laid bathed in gold,
The green of the marshes lies round at my feet,
While the deep blue sky hangs overhead.

II
O the marshes of Glynn! the marshes of Glynn!
Where the tide ebbs and flows, a watery  waste,
Where the fine future gleams in a mottled sky,
And the grasses are silver and gold and gray.

- Sidney Lanier
