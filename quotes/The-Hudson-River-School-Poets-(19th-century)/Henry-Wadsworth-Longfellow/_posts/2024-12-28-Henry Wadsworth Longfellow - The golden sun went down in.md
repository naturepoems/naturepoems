The golden sun went down in blood,
The cowards 'neath its shadow run,
While bravest rivers share their flood,
And sing the songs of day done.

The quiet night was full of sound,
The wind it whispered in the trees,
And nature wrapped the world around,
Inviting peace on every breeze.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
