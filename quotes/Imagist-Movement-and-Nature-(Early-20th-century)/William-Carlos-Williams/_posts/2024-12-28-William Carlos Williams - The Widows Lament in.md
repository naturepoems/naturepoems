The Widow's Lament in Springtime
Sorrow is my own
eating's allowance,

but joy can be heavy--

I watched
my live fingers
in the cherry limbs.

It is always the same
in springtime,
from the branches
of which I think only
of these black
birds and white petals,

and the grim
of the crocus peaking
through not only ground
-to show its face, O, no.

But the blue of your fingers,
here at the last,

sudden amid these
blossoms, it is Death
among the coming,

these live, as they outlast,
just now blooms and fall.


- William Carlos Williams
