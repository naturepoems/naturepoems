The Home of the Dunes

O the stretch of the sandy dunes,
   And their whispers soft as night.
Where the ocean sings its vague tunes,
   And the stars step forth with light.

In this balm of the summerâ€™s grace,
   Where the waves embrace the shore,
There lies a world of silent space,
   With every breeze a lore.

So let me wander through the sands,
   And know the secret ways;
For in this blessed land that stands,
   I find celestial rays.

- Lizette Woodworth Reese
