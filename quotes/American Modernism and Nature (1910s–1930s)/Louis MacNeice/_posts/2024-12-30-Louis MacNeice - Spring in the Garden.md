Spring in the Garden  

See how the wind grows greenly wild,  
As joy creeps forth in every corner,  
Flora dance their silken arms —  
Heedless of my wants as they reel  
In the bright music between the trees;  
They tell me I am swimming here,  
Step-by-step, beside each flower's face.  

For though the spring glints around,  
Its radiance drowns sorrow in such ease,  
I too desire time to hold and catch  
This simple happiness, complete —  
An anchor set among willow and pine  
Where breath and joy become as bright  
Pinwheels spinning into the breeze,  
In that dance anew each year,  
I gather all of your voices,  
Amalgamed as one.  

What this garden knows  
Is how each dream,  
Born but a moment once,  
Still endures to visit us again.

- Louis MacNeice
