The desert breathes in golden hues,
Underneath a blazing sun,
Each grain of sand, a tale ensues,
Of life that dances, wild and fun.

Cacti stretch with arms held high,
In steadfast strength, they greet the heat,
In arid beauty, dreams will fly,
In the silence, the heart's own beat.

- Richard Wagner
