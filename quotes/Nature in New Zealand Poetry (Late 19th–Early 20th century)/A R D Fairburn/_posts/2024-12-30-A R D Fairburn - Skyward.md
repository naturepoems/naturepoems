Skyward

Look up! The clouds, they race away,
A canvas vast of azure blue,
Where nothing hinders, nothing stays,
The birds are free, and so are you.

Let not your worries hold you down,
The sky speaks of a greater plan,
Reach for the heavens like a crown,
And join the dance, as nature can.


- A R D Fairburn
