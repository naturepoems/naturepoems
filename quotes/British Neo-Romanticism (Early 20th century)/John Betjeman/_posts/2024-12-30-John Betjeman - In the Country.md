The bees are buzzing round the lavender.
The thistles swaying to the gentle breeze.
Each flower casts its shadow down this place,
The world presents a wealth of simple ease.

And with each rustle of the leaves around,
I sense the past that lingers in the ground,
A whispering, sacred harmony profound.


- John Betjeman
