Dew Drops
At break of dawn, as night recedes,  
The dew drops glisten on tender reeds;  
Each crystal drop, a world contained,  
Reflecting wonders, unexplained.  
They dance in the sunlight, a gentle play,  
Droplets of dreams, set free today.  
In nature’s embrace, they linger and glow,  
Beneath the soft touch of the morning show.  
In every sparkle, hope takes flight,  
As day unfolds from the cloak of night.  
Cherish these moments, for they shall pass,  
Like dew drops fading in the day’s warm grasp.
