A Song of Summer
As the waves of the deep roll unto the shore,
So my love for the summer spins evermore.
The soft breath of breezes, and warm sunlight glow,
Kiss the fields of the dream where the wild roses grow.

Through the meadows where waters flow crystal and bright,
To the heart of the woods where the stars wait for night;
My heart sings her chorus, there's beauty in sorrow,
For the dawn that is breaking brings hope for the morrow.
