Thou pale and peaceful moon!  
Upon my wandering soul I lean,  
For here I find the sacred bloom—  
An influence ethereal, a ghosted dream;  
 
Which delves in woods, in shadows that frown,  
Great secrets of ancients—lost and renown;  
O, thee I've known ere hath the night:  
Behold my quiet wonder steeped in your light.

- George Gordon Lord Byron
