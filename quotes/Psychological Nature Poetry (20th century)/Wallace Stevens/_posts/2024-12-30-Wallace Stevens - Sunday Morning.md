Sunday Morning

Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her.
This is the death of a certain idea of beauty,
The region of the coiled and the interlaced
Solidities in the wind —
The march of the perceiving world —
What can be more beautiful
Than the world as it is, so
With the air, the light, the trees,
And the movement of the people, or of the thoughts,
And the mutation of thought?

The earth is what she was
Before all were bruised,
And before all were bruised.
The trees are trees still.
And the waters are, in their deepness,
They are warmth, and still extremely loud,
The world is still, as ever, movement loud
And the hands of the people upon it.

But perhaps not terrible.
Perhaps, more beautiful.


- Wallace Stevens
