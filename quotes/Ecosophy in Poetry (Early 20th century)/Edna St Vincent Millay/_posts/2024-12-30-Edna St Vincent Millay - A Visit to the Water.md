A Visit to the Water  
  -----------------------  
I went to see the water,  
  And found it shallow;  
The path was clear and soft with moss,  
  And the sky felt near like a blanket,  
When I saw the moon slip down  
Among the branches like a firefly;  
  I turned to go back, but the night was still,  
And the stars winked again in the sky.  
  And as I walked  
Among the trees,  
I could hear the cricket,  
In the day;  
  And the frogs sang loud  
With voices like a symphony,  
And I made a promise to return,  
  And see them dance againâ€”  
The sweet tragedy of the night.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
