The brook, under the rock, it is 
My own voice, murmuring low, 
Passes through the thick-leaved trees, 
As softly, so soft I can hardly know.

Ah! it is beauty alone will spell, 
And render me a creature of mere delight, 
Thus in silence all hidden in stillness dwell, 
And envision my heart take flight.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
