Rather than love, than money, than fame,
Give me truth that nature speaks—with no mask.
In the rustle of leaves, in the sky’s soft claim,
The universe implores; it’s an unending task.

And while man may argue, judge, and blame,
The world spins on, untainted, divine.
Lose not your spirit in the pursuit of false aims,
Return to the earth, and the stars will align.

- Henry David Thoreau
