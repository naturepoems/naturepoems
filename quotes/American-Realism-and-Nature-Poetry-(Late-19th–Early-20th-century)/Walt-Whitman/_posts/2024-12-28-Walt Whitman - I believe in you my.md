---

I believe in you, my soul,
  I believe in you,--
  No one else knows what I know,
  No one else knows.  

In vain. In vain—
All proclaim, but I know everything's sent to me.  
  I will send everything—
  Everything will be sent.  

The secret from the world,
  From the eyes looking forth,
  A thousand eyes warring against us,
  Yet I believe, I believe.  


- Walt Whitman
