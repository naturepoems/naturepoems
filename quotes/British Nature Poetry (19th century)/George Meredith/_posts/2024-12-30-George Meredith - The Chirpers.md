The Chirpers
Here in the woods doth hum a tune,
And against grey skies, the teeming boughs
Lift up their arms to catch the moon,
And each tree here doth laugh with vows.
\nFor while I muse within these glades,
And crowding sounds beneath the leaves,
The chirpers of the year in spades
Remind me she who always grieves.
\nTo-night, as all the roads grow wide,
I take a light for thee my muse,
Into the wood, and side-by-side
Weâ€™ll melt into the shades, I choose.

- George Meredith
