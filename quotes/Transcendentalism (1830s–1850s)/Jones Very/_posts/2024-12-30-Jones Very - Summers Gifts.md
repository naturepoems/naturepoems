Within the strong hands of Summer  
I wandered forth to see  
What lovely treasures Nature holds,  
And found they were meant for me.

A brook did leap 'twixt fragrant hills,  
With sparkling face of joy;  
The air to breathe, so pure and sweet,  
Brought back the child in every boy.

And lo! a flower, a glowing sun,  
Burst forth upon my sight,  
Its colors gleaming, radiant,  
In every shade of light.

Oh, peace of every sunset hour,  
Came melting within my heart,  
With visions of the silken grass,  
As all my weariness did part.

And there I knew the cheerful truth,  
Which nature should impart,  
That joy is just a wistful child,  
Who lives within the heart.
