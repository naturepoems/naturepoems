Twilight slips through daisy chains,  
Silken webs of cool nightâ€™s breath.  
In the twinkling pitch it reigns,  
Covering all with silent death.

Yet from the darkness embers weave,  
The gentle blush of day undone.  
In sharp contrast softly cleaved,  
Nature spins her web as one.

And as the evening embers creep,  
The promise of a new dawn lies  
In every secret that we keep,  
Entangled notes in lover's sighs.


- Philip Larkin
