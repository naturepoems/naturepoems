Ode to the Dew,
So small, so frail,
Yet kissed by morning’s light;
Lies a gem on leaf and vale,
Nature's breath in silver tight.

Your sparkle beckons travelers,
With every gentle rise,
A choir of nature’s whispers,
In the dawn’s enamored eyes.

Awake! Embrace the daytime,
For night will claim your grace,
But in our hearts you linger,
In time, no more, no less, no space.

The silence echoes softly,
As petals slowly part,
You remind us through the delicate,
Of nature’s generous heart.

- David Garnett
