The golden fields of autumn’s grace,
Where harvest dances in the breeze,
Each ear of corn, nature's embrace,
Whispers of summer's sweet reprise.

Amber leaves in crisp air drift,
Painting the landscape with vibrant hues,
A tapestry of colors, a wondrous gift,
In the earthy scent of morning dew.

- Richard Wagner
