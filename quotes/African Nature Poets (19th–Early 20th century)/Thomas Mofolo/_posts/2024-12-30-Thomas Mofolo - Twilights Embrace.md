The beauty of dusk, a fire's glow,  
As day surrenders to twilight’s flow,  
Colors bleed into the night’s embrace,  
While stars emerge with a tender grace.

Nature’s canvas, painted anew,  
Every shade whispers, ‘I welcome you,’  
In the deepening dark, let us repose,  
In harmony with the ebb and the flows.

- Thomas Mofolo
