As breezes carry the scent of rain,  
The earth awakens, shedding its pain,  
With each drop that falls, a song to hear,  
Of life renewed, with every tear.

The world shimmers, a crystal delight,  
In nature’s arms, everything feels right,  
With love in each petal, each leaf designed,  
A reminder of beauty forever entwined.

- Thomas Mofolo
