Cradle Song  
Sweet dreams, form a shade  
O’er my lovely infant's head!  
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams  
By happy, silent, glades!  
  
Sweet Sleep, with soft down,  
Weave thy palms for the bower;  
Banish sorrow and affright,  
And to the day give light!  
  
O, how I dread thy sullen flight,  
Thou that changest day to night!  
  
Sweet, soft, and slow,  
O let thy sounds go!  
  
This is my favorite song.  
**William Blake**
