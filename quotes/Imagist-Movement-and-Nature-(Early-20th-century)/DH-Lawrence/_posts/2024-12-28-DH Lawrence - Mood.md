Mood
  
Let me stand alone,
Close my eyes, and listen
To the pulse of the world,
A throb beneath my feet,
An echo all around me.

The air is full of scent,
Of earth and sky entwined,
The sunlight flickers,
Caressing without choice
All things that live and breathe,
Those humble things.

What is really spoken,
In the rustle of the grass,
In the chorus of bees,
I am but a soft whisper
Surrounded by the rich intent.

                         - DH Lawrence
