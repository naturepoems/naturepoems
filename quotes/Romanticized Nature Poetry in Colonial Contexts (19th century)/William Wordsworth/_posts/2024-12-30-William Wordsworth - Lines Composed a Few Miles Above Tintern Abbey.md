Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey,
On Revisiting the Banks of the Wye during a Tour,
July 13, 1798
Five years have past; five summers, with the length
Of five long winters! And again I hear
These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs
With a sweet inland voice across the glade,
And coming from the hills, and the deep vale,
It is the wildest of things, free and wild;
And will it abide, while I am meeting it?
Yet think, that I may not be alone,
As long as there shines a place to whirl with joy,

In the opposite grandeur of these waters
Shall I, too, be free?

- William Wordsworth
