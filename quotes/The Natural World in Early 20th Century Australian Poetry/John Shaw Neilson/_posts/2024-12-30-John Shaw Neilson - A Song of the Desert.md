A Song of the Desert

In the burning light of the desert day,
    Where no green grass has grown,
I found the songs of the winds at play,
    And felt a world my own.

For beauty, like a distant star,
    Can shine in barren sand;
And scattered flowers, like gems afar,
    Are kissed by Natureâ€™s hand.

- John Shaw Neilson
