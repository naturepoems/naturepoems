A Summer Day
---

What joy it is to wander free,
In fields of gold, beneath the tree,
To feel the sun, the breeze so light,
To dance through day and into night.

With every flower, the earth awakes,
In laughter shared, in paths we make,
O Summer, hold me close, stay near,
Your fleeting warmth I cherish dear.

---

Let me linger in your sunlit grace,
In every moment, I find my place.


- Henry David Thoreau
