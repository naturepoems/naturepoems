The Wild Rose

The wild rose blooms, a simple cup,  
  With petals soft yet frail,  
That catches dew, as sweetness light,  
  And wafts upon the gale.  
In tangled thickets, hidden low,  
  It weaves a lovely spell,  
A blush of life amid the gray,  
  That speaks of all is well.

Untamed and free, it nods and sways,  
  With laughter rich and bold,  
A petaled promise, fierce and fair,  
  With stories to be told.  
For as the dusk begins to fall,  
  I see the beauty rise,  
In tendrils curled and fragrance sweet,  
  A dance beneath the skies.

O resilient child of earth, I greet  
  Your color and your grace,  
For in your bloom, a world is found,  
  That time cannot erase.  
Your whispers echo through the night,  
  A tune of love so clear,  
And every wild rose in the world  
  Is a song that we can hear.

- Charles GD Roberts
