The Field

O tranquil Field, where daisies sway,
Your gentle breath reflects the sun,
In every blade, the song of day,
A stage where Nature’s play is spun.

From morning light to twilight’s gold,
You cradle dreams in every flower,
Within your bounds, the tales unfold,
Of love and laughter, joy and power.

And when the day fades into night,
Your whispers linger in the air,
In silence, you embrace the light,
And wake the heart to dreams laid bare.


- Mary Elizabeth Coleridge
