The Dance of Winter

When winter’s breath enfolds the land,
In icy grip, a master’s hand;
The world adorned in crystals white,
A beauty pure, a tranquil sight.

Beneath the snow, the earth sleeps tight,
Awaiting spring’s warm breath of light;
In frosty air, the silence sings,
In slumber deep, anticipation clings.

Yet see the magic winter weaves,
In every bough, in every eave;
For in the dance of chilling air,
Life’s promise lingers, soft and rare.


- Philip Webb
