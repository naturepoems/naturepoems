Winter blankets all in white,  
A world transformed in icy sheen,  
The trees stand tall like sentinels,  
In a silent dance, serene.

Footsteps crunch on frosted ground,  
Each breath a cloud in the brisk air,  
And nature holds her breath profound,  
While stars lace the night with flair.

The hush of snow, a tranquil sight,  
Whispers of peace within the chill,  
As the world pauses in pure delight,  
Time slows down, and hearts are still.

- Andrej Ērgļs
