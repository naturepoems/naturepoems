The Rain

We will not turn our back on the damp of the day,
     While the winds of the night like the sigh wrestle,
But with flowers to carry low all the way  
     Of the pearl of the tears, as a Heaven’s vessel.

When the light through the openings of the shadows breaks,
     And the heart that shines under waters no more,
So still shall the shadow where the sorrow wakes,
     Dream through the waves of the light that we bore.

Wherein we peep into the soft silver stream,
     With the tears that beat light in the charms that prevail;
While the night comes dear, and we blush as we dream,
     Yet the peaceful heart’s will stoops ever so frail.


- Algernon Charles Swinburne
