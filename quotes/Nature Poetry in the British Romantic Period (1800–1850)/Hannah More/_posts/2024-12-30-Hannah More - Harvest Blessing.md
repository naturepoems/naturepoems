Amongst the fields of golden grain,
Where sun and shadow intertwine,
The heart finds joy in nature's reign,
And rests in peace, so pure, divine.

The harvest time, with scents so sweet,
Brings forth the bounty of the earth;
A wonderment in every beat,
Of life and love and newfound mirth.

Oh, nature's hand bestows a gift,
In every season, every way;
Let us rejoice and give a lift,
To gratitude in every day.

- Hannah More
