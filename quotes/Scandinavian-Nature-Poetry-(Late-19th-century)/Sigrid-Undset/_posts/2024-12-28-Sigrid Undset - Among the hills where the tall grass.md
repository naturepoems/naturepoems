Among the hills where the tall grass sways,  
I lose my heart in the rhythm of days.  
The babble of brooks, singing along,  
Lifts my spirit like a gentle song.

Stars cling softly to the velvet night,  
Crickets serenade, a sweet delight.  
In every nook, in every place,  
Nature's splendor, a warm embrace.

- Sigrid Undset
