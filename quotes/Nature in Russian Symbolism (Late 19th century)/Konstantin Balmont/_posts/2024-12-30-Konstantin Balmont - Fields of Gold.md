In the gentle sway of fields unending,
  The golden grains reflect the sun,
  The air is thick with sweet surrender,
  And life unfolds, a web of fun.
  
  Each moment captured in the silence,
  Each heartbeat tied to Nature's song,
  In every blade of grass, existence,
  Proclaims the truth â€” where we belong.

- Konstantin Balmont
