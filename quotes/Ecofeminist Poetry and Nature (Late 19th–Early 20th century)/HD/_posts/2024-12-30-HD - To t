To the Lighthouse  

The world shines bright
with soft dew,
  and the leaf-turned
      flowers shine bright.
What of the flowers,
      sick to the summer
      with the deadness?

They lay in a fume.
The night drapes low.
  I see the bright sea
    in the silverness,
the bareblown boughs,
  sweet with dew.

H.D.
