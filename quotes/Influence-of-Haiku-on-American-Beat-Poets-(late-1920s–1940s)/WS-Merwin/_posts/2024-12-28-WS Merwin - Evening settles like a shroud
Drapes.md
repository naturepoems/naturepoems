Drapes"

author: WS Merwin
quote: "Evening settles like a shroud,
Drapes heavily over the fields' forgotten seams;
In the creases, shadows deepen,
Drawing dark lines of life into slumber.
The cool earth breathes out softly,
A whisper amid the sigh of stars,
Where the silk of night turns luminous
Under the watchful gaze of the moon."

Evening settles like a shroud,
Drapes heavily over the fields' forgotten seams;
In the creases, shadows deepen,
Drawing dark lines of life into slumber.
The cool earth breathes out softly,
A whisper amid the sigh of stars,
Where the silk of night turns luminous
Under the watchful gaze of the moon.
