The seasons change, the leaves fall down,
The flowers fade, their colors drown;
Yet in my heart, their beauty stays,
In Nature’s song, I find my ways.

The cycle spins, and time reveals,
The truths that only Nature feels;
For in these whispers, I can see,
The endless love she has for me.


- Edna St Vincent Millay
