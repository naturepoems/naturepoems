Nestled in the quiet,
let me absorb your grace,
a magic rooted deep
where beauty finds embrace.
In the soft echoes
of pink and fluorescent hues,
the flowers paint a picture
of nature’s quiet muse.
Among the grassy hills,
with each step I take,
i enter your passage,
where moments gently break.
Oh wilderness, unfurl,
your heart is a treasure,
each leaf, a soft rhythm,
a secluded, precious measure.
