The Mountains

Majestic peaks, so high and grand,
A sentinel above the land;
In their shadows, the valleys lie,
Where secrets whisper and eagles fly.

From frozen heights to river plains,
The mountains guard their ancient pains,
In every rock, time’s story flows,
A testament to life that grows.

- Marjorie Pickthall
