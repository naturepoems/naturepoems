The Summer Day

Who made the world?  Who made the swan,  and the black bear?  Who made the grasshopper?
This grasshopper, I mean—  the one who has flung herself  out of the grass,  the one who is eating sugar  out of my hand,  who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.
Now she lifts her pale forearms  and thoroughly washes her face.
I’m amazed at the grace of it,  the privilege of it.
As for the grasshopper,  she’s delightful,  she doesn’t have a clue that she’s extraordinary.
I don’t know exactly what a prayer is.
I do know how to pay attention,  how to fall down  into the grass,  how to kneel down in the grass,  how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,
which is what I have been doing all day.
Tell me, what else should I have done?  Doesn’t everything die at last,  and too soon?  Tell me, what is it you plan to do  with your one wild and precious life?

- Mary Oliver
