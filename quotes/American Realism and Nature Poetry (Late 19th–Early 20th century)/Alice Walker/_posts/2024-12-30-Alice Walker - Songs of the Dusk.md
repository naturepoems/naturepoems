In the quiet dusk,
the air thick with the scent of jasmine,
I pause to remember,
each heartbeat is a reminder
of the beauty that surrounds me.

Moths flutter lazily,
a dance for the fading light,
bound by instinct,
earthing the whispers of night,
and the stars begin to emerge,
a tapestry of dreams,
hope woven into our spirits,
a shared experience of wonder.

In the dark, I find connection,
each flicker of light
an affirmation of existence,
a promise to return
and continue this journey,
a dance with the infinite.

- Alice Walker
