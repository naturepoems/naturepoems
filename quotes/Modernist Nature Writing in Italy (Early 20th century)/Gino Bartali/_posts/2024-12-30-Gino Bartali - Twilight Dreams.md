In the twilight hour,  
when day kisses night,  
the world holds its breath,  
a moment suspended in time.  
Shadows stretch long,  
and the stars awaken,  
pinpricks of light,  
scattered across the velvet sky.  

The air is thick with magic,  
a tapestry of dreams,  
where reality wanes,  
and the imagination takes flight,  
a celestial embrace,  
a gateway to the unknown.

- Gino Bartali
