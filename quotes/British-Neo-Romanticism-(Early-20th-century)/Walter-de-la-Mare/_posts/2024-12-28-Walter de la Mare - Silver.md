Silver
Slowly, silently, now the moon 
  Walks the night in her silver shoon. 
This way, and that, she peers, and sees 
  Silver fruit upon silver trees; 
One by one the casements catch 
  Her beams beneath the silvery thatch; 
Couched in his kennel, like a log, 
  With paws of silver sleeps the dog; 
From their shadowy cottage homes, 
  The witches with their silver brooms 
Fly oâ€™er the wooden hills, and see 
  The trees, the bushes, and the streams; 
From the hairy bog, down to the sea, 
  The silver sort here is as fair; 
In undisturbed peacefulness 
  All creatures awaken a silent care.


- Walter de la Mare
