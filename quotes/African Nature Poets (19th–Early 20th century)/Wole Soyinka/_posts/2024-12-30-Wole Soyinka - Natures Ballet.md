Nature’s Ballet

See how the leaves pirouette,
In the gentle arms of spring,
A choreography of life,
That only nature can bring.
The flowers sway in rhythm,
With the music of the breeze,
A dance that knows no boundaries,
On the petals, on the trees.

I lose myself in this ballet,
Where earth and sky entwine,
In every turning spiral,
A tale of love so divine.
Let me join this wild embrace,
With laughter in my soul,
Where nature weaves her tapestry,
And makes the fractured whole.

— Wole Soyinka
