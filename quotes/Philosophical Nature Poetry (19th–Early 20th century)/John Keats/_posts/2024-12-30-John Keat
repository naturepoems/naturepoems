Hyperion

Book I

Deep in the shady sadness of a vale
A solitary spirit, in a womb
Of dark earth forged, made seedling grain avail
To head among the thickets, through cold keep
Of thirst have seized, issuing with wail.

While gardens the sylvan dales take rent,
Which in long-cecking shades I seem to see.
From nought’s all-day bliss where Mortals bent
Gave no sigh of throes from night’s strong hold.
A cymbal rais'd! I saw round me upborne—
Forth of all shapes and sylvan arrows drawn,
While the roses of air sent strong onset high.

I wander by the boughs that skin the bloom
Of rustic night in applaud and turning
To bid thee feast where none doggedly years,
Can lace with eyes, like a blistering beam.
— *Hyperion*

- John Keats
