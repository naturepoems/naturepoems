The seasons turn, the world does change,  
In nature's dance, so free and strange.  
From summer's warmth to winter's chill,  
Each moment offers its own thrill.  

The blossoms bloom, then fade away,  
Yet in their time, they brightly play.  
Embrace the cycle, hold it near,  
For every end brings something dear.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
