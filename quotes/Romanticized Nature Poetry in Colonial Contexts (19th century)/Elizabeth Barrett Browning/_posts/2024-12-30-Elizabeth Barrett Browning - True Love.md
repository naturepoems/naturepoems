Ah, love, let us be true to one another!
For the sake of the temples and the groves!
Let me be to you as the flowers are to the sun!
Let our roots twine deep within the earth,
And we can bear each otherâ€™s bloom and fruit.

When winter winds whip through the barren trees,
Let us remember all the joys of spring;
That through the death of seasons makes the living
Continuously new in eternal light.
For even through the chilling winds that blow,
Our love can warm the heart when life is cold.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
