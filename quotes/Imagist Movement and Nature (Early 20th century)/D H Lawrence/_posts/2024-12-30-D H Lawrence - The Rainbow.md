The Rainbow

  The rainbow is a lunar flute
  in the drench of dampâ€”it swings,
  a vagrant in the sky,
  and hounds you like your laughter,.
  O vibrant spiralescent arc
  of curious sparkle!
  You grow and fade from passion,
  wander in wonder as song.
  Perhaps the stars are awash
  in your water-colours,
  along the way, they drink
  the near harvest of your hue.


- D H Lawrence
