The Snow

Softly, so softly it falls,
A blanket of white settles,
Quietly mellowing all the sounds,
It covers the tracks of yesterday.

The trees wrap themselves in warmth,
Branches heavy with dreams,
The earth holds its breath,
Waiting for the touch of spring to arrive.

In this stillness, a pause—  
I step beyond time,
And listen to the heartbeat  
Of nature’s lullaby,  
The whispers of ancient snow.


- Robert Bly
