The sun crashes against the horizon,
    a splatter of crimson and gold,
    an audacious splash of art,
    a modern miracle of color and fire.
    The earth quakes with ecstasy!

With resolute passion,
    I leap into the fray of vivid light,
    to merge with the effervescent rhythm
    of the world, breathing endless energy.

- Filippo Tommaso Marinetti
