A Faun, or perhaps a Dryad,
Would shimmer in the dappled green,
Among the oaks and ancient yews,
Where sunlight bathes the forest floor,

And wrapped in love, the evening stirs,
With breezes gently blowing by,
Cascading laughter like the streams,
Whispering secrets to the sky.

   — "The Faun" (Excerpt)

- John Keats
