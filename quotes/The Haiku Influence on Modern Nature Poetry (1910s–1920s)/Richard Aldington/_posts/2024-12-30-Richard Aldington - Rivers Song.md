The river flows through the valley,
A mirror of the whispering sky,
With each bend, a tale unfurls,
Of life and love, of loss and gain.

As I stand, entranced by its grace,
I feel the passage of time take hold,
Engulfed in the warmth of its presence,
Nature’s heart beats in this steady flow,
A reminder of all that I am.

- Richard Aldington
