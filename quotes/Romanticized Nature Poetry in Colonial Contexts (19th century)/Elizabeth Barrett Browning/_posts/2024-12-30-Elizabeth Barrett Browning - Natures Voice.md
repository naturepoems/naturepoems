The mountain peaks that pierce the sky,
Stand stark against the azure high;
And o’er them all the shadows creep,
And silence stirs the heart to weep.

Yet midst this stillness, wild and deep,
The streams let forth a ceaseless sigh:
In waterfalls they rush and sweep,
With sunny glints that beam and die.

And if these darkling rocks could speak,
They’d tell of battles lost and won;
Of pilgrims, fleeing, faint and weak,
Sought refuge in their shade and sun.

For mingling leaves upon the trees,
Whisper of stories dark and bright,
The mysteries that never cease
In Nature’s ever-changing light.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
