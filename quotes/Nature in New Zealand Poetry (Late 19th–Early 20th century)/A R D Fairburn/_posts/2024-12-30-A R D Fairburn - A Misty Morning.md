A Misty Morning

A misty morning rises soft,
The hills are shrouded, lost in dreams,
The trees, they stand like sentinels,
Half-formed in muted, silvered gleams.

The river breathes a gentle sigh,
Its surface smooth like polished glass,
Reflecting all the quiet world,
As moments linger, hours pass.


- A R D Fairburn
