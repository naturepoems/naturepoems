The hills are a lie,
wrapped in the beauty of deceit,
for within their curves
and balances lies death’s promise,
each colorful blossom a reminder
that beauty fades.

We live by each horizon,
each footstep an imprint of being.
A place where the unkempt
and the gentle collide,
a world of endless possibility,
it beckons us to journey,
to awaken the soul.

There’s power in the sun, 
energy of the stars,
pervading the very air;
as the insects buzz and the earth stirs,
let us dance in this light.

- Nadine Gordimer
