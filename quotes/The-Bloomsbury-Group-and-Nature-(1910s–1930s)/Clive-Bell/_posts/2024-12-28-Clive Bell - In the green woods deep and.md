In the green woods, deep and high,
Where the shadows fall and the echoes sigh,
Nature sings her quiet song,
A melody sweet where we belong.

In the rustle of leaves, in the soft, cool air,
In the gentle whisper of a deer with care,
Life unfolds in vibrant hues,
A tapestry of greens, yellows, and blues.

The sunbeams dance on the forest floor,
Kissing the petals, a lover's lore,
While rivers hum a lulling tune,
Reflecting joys beneath the moon.

- Clive Bell
