Beneath the Stars

When night descends and shadows creep,
The stars emerge, the heavens breathe;
In silence deep, the world is steeped,
In cosmic dreams, the heart, it seethes.

Each spark a story, ancient, bold,
A beacon in the velvet sea;
The night unfolds its cloak of gold,
A canvas wide for souls to be.

So gaze upon that endless art,
Let starlight kiss your weary brow;
In nature's calm, find peace to start,
And in their glow, make solemn vow.

- Helen M B M Maud
