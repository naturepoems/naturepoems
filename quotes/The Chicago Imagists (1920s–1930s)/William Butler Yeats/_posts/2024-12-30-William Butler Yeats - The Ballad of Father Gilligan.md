The Ballad of Father Gilligan

The Pious priest asleep was in his chair,
     He mumbled prayers, repeating of the past,
But when he woke the swans were gone.
The voice of one began to ask:
Who helped his stumbling steps??
A shadow came so softly on the day,
     No bright voice at its head.

‘O who shall save me once again?'  
The shadowed swans sang light through groves —
Who knows who would raise their hand?
On this grey changed that came unseen?
He knew his prayers worth such a crown  
To drown the morning down the game.


- William Butler Yeats
