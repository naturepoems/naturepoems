Frost at Midnight
The Frost performs its secret ministry,
Unhelped by any wind. The owlet’s cry
Came loud—and hark, again! Loud as before.

But what is this, you know?
What was that? It seems now different: It must change.

Oh! what a voice with so deep a sound,
You will ever be this luminous summer’s day!
Holy, high, and bright!

- Samuel Taylor Coleridge
