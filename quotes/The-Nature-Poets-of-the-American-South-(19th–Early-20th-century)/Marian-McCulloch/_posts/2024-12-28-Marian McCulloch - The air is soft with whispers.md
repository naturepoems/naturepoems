The air is soft with whispers,  
  The trees bow low and sigh,  
  While evening mist caresses  
  The sunset in the sky.

  A fading gold, a glimmer,  
  A moonbeam’s gentle grace,  
  Where wildflowers dance together,  
  In this enchanted place.

  The brook sings to the lilies,  
  As fireflies twinkle bright,  
  In this tender moment,  
  Nature holds her breath tonight.
