Moonlight Serenade

In the stillness of night beneath a silver sun,  
The earth is wrapped in dreams, as day is done;  
The moonlight casts a spell on all below,  
In its gentle caress, the world does glow.  

The stars twinkle like diamonds, bright and bold,  
As whispers of night unfold stories untold;  
And in this serenade of silken light,  
Nature dances softly, out of sight.  

So let us close our eyes and dream away,  
In the moonâ€™s embrace, where we long to stay;  
For in the magic of night, we find our peace,  
In the whispered secrets that will never cease.

- E J Brady
