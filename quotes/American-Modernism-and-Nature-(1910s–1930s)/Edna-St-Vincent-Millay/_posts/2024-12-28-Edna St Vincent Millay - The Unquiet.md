The Unquiet Grave

The unquiet grave is watching lonely time;
  In the golden leaves I find my way,
To walk among the woodland shades that climb
  Beneath a lidded sky far away. 
I grasp with trembling hands and bring the dust
  From off the crocus, faintly higher, 
Until before my feet the leaves must rust
  And whisper softly all my praise for fire.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
