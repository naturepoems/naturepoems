The Wind

I hear the wind,
A-whispering through the trees.
I hear it sighing in the grass,
And in the gentle breeze.

Its voice is soft and tender,
Like loveâ€™s most secret song;
It sweeps my heart in rhythms
Where every soul belongs.

It dances on the river,
And sweeps across the shore;
It carries tales of nature
That whisper evermore.

So let me feel the wind,
Its touch upon my face;
For in its sweet companionship,
I find my resting place.

- Lizette Woodworth Reese
