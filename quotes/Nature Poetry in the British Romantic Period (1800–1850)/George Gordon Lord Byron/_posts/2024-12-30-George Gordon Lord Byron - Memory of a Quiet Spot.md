Yet I can never forget,
Sweet is the memory of that place
Where in my childhood's day I met,
A hidden fount, a sunlit grace.
Where lilies pressed against the dell
And softly tangled through the shade,
There Nature whispered all her spell—
And all my future must be made.


- George Gordon Lord Byron
