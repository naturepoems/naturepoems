Flora erupting in riotous hues,
Petals tender and robust,
generator of life’s energy
blooming through cracks,
of pavements, cracks,
In human living and giving.

We salute the sunflower’s turn,
twisting for the sun’s ray;
We bask in rivers’ curl,
Sand underfoot, sunlit,
brown bread by the water’s edge.

Leaf and driftwood,
Shimmer and fade,
In nature’s intricate weavings,
I, firm in my place,
Sing back to the earth,
tell the stories of finding my footing.


- Anne Waldman
