You will not find, go search the world,  
Such treasure as the simple land;  
In meadows green, the heart unfurled,  
The life we dream of, hand in hand.

For here the songs of nature call  
To lovers brave, to friends of heart;  
A world of laughter, joy for all,  
In fields and skies where dreams depart.

- A E Housman
