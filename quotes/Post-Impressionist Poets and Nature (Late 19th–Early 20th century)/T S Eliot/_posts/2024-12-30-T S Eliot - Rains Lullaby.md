A soft rain falls, in a gentle cascade,  
   Cleansing the earth, a life serenade.  
   Each drop a blessing, a hymn from above,  
   Quenching the thirst of the land that we love.
   
   Puddles form, mirrors to the sky,  
   Reflecting the clouds as they drift by.  
   In this moment, we pause and we breathe,  
   For nature's embrace brings solace, we grieve.

- T S Eliot
