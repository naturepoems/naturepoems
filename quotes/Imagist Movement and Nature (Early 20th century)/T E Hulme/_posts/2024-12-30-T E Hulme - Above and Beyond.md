Above and Beyond

Frail clouds overhead,
Drifting slowly by,
Pforms on the fabrics,
Layers where days drift,  
Into long shadows.

Color bursts bright,
Red curtains with life fretting,
Twinkle echoes of yet,
In wild circling distant beings;
Above and beyond soul's journey,
Life stirs with dreams,
Soft at the heart,
And all are still,  
Condensing earth,
Yearning infinity.

- T E Hulme
