With Nature's Grace
With every step upon the earth,
We dance to nature’s timeless song,
In mountains high and valleys mirth,
In every heartbeat, we belong.

So let us walk this path of light,
With open hearts, in nature’s grace,
In every moment, pure and bright,
Together, find our sacred space.

- Aldona Gustava
