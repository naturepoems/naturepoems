The summer fields are vast with gold,
Swells of barley bowing low,
While heat dances softly beneath the sun,
And bees hum their whispered song.

Now and then, a cloud drifts by,
With promises of rain and renewal,
Yet the moment holds tightly the warmth,
And joy burgeons in an echoing pulse—
Life abounds in this golden hour.

- Richard Aldington
