The white blossoms drift like whispers, 
In the thin air of twilight’s breath.
Each petal a memory spread,
Whirling on the ghost of the wind.

Spring’s embrace is fleeting and shy, 
Yet with every soft blush, I know—
Nature sings in verses delicate,
And here in the dusk, we become one,
A union of thousands of stories told.

- Richard Aldington
