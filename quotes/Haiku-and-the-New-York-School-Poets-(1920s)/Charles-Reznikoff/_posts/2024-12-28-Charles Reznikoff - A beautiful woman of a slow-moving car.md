quote: "A beautiful woman of a slow-moving car  
  stopped near the shore,  
gazing at the rising sun,  
  everything in the world was still;  
a quiet moment between  
the earth and sky,  
  panic nests in the heart."

A beautiful woman of a slow-moving car  
  stopped near the shore,  
gazing at the rising sun,  
  everything in the world was still;  
a quiet moment between  
the earth and sky,  
  panic nests in the heart.
