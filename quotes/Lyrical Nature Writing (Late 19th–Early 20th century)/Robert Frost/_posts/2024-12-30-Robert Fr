The Gift Outright

The land was ours before we were the land's.
She was our's, and we ‘thought' of her ours; until
We weren't quite there among that which is ours,
Rhythms rise and fall and become a world to speak.

But I will not let it go, and through the years,
There is a new eternal warmth of folk and voice,
For now it holds the air in clouded light,
Yet continues to hold what makes it unknown still.

And this will keep forging in the strong—a tree and a role,
The garlanded figure of paperwork, the roof of the sky.
And the dance we prepare of up and around.
From our heart within the weathered land,
Where the moon must form new lines with the dreams of red, and blue;—
And even fine words shall take this as the guide:
Reclaim the air, and thus we wind into pyramids—the gift brought perfect.

- Robert Frost
