Dream Variation

To fling my arms wide
In the sleepy, blue air,
I will launch my heart into the sky,
And catch the stars that allow me to dream.

Dance for joy,
Be free among the flowers
And their scent will wrap around me
Like arms cradling the warmth of the sun.

In the harmony of night, I will belong,
Beneath moonlight’s embrace, where nature sings my soul
In rhythms, in whispers of every color,
Where I, too, can fade into the stars.

- Langston Hughes
