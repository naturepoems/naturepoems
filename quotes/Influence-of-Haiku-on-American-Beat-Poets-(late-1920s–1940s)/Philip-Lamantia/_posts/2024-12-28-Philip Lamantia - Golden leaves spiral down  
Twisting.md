quote: "Golden leaves spiral down,  
Twisting in a ballet of decay,  
They carpet the earth in a rustling hush,  
Each one a memory of summer’s light,  
Surrendering to the embrace of fall."

Golden leaves spiral down,  
Twisting in a ballet of decay,  
They carpet the earth in a rustling hush,  
Each one a memory of summer’s light,  
Surrendering to the embrace of fall.
