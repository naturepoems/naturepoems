author: Ezra Pound
quote: "In twilight's hush, the world exhales,  
   colors fade to shades of gray,  
   while night encroaches, soft and slow.
    
   Owls take wing, the stars ignite,  
   a canvas painted deep with dreams,  
   nature whispers secrets, softly shared."

In twilight's hush, the world exhales,  
   colors fade to shades of gray,  
   while night encroaches, soft and slow.
    
   Owls take wing, the stars ignite,  
   a canvas painted deep with dreams,  
   nature whispers secrets, softly shared.
