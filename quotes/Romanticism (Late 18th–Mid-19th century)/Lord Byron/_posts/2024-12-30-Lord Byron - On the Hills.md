Winds of the west, awake!  
Bring forth the flood-tides of your air;  
And let the charms of nature wake,  
With murmurs gone, and silken bare,  
For distance fades, and nearness vows,  
So wane the hours where hope doth half obscure;  
A monument of our quiet hours in white and bruised,

- Lord Byron
