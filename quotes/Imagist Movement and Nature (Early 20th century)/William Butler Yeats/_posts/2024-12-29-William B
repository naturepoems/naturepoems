The Interrogation

As I had written and received yesterday,  
What herbs shall revive my dreams?  
When the fluttering crowd of murmured sound  
Shall all turn lonely in their wanting,  
It is with purity of heart and purity of mind  
That there will play around and inside of me  
Ever-higher whims of the world's dismay.  
Oh sweet notes of little clashing springs;  
Or have I been accounted wrong  
In singing thee into  
The bowing age in  
Land's of steady thought? 
Let your angel wait;
They cannot drown in the dark green sea!

- William Butler Yeats
