quote: "The brook babbles secrets, lost in timeless flow,
Each stone a witness to the tales they know.
Ripples shimmer under a gaze of twilight, 
In their tranquil presence, the day yields to night."

The brook babbles secrets, lost in timeless flow,
Each stone a witness to the tales they know.
Ripples shimmer under a gaze of twilight, 
In their tranquil presence, the day yields to night.

- Gaston Bachelard
