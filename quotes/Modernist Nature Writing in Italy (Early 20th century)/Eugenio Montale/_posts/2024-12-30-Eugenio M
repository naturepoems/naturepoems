The Thicket

The thicket stands dense with promise,
Every branch a shadow, every leaf a spark,
Whispers rustle through the wild chaos,
Alive with life’s veiled pulse.

Amidst shadows, secrets wait, entrapped,
Echoes of creatures’ breath fill the silence,
The thicket’s embrace holds my wary heart,
A sanctuary of raw, untamed essence.

- Eugenio Montale
