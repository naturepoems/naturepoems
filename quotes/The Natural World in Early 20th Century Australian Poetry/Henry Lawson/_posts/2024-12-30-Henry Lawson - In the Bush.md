In the Bush

In the great, wild, lonely bush,
Where the bleak winds sing and moan,
And the tall trees bend and crush,
With a sense of grief alone.

Where the timid creatures hide,
And the shadows creep around,
In the silenceâ€”like a tide,
Or a deep and vibrant sound.

There I wander all alone,
Through the splendid tangled trees,
Where the darkened skies are shown,
And the spirit's calm and ease.

With each step I tread along,
Underneath the skies so blue,
In the wild, the weak, the strong,
Nature whispers soft and true.

- Henry Lawson
