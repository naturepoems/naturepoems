The quiet dawn, with golden grace,
   Awakens life from restful sleep;
A symphony of nature’s face,
   The hour when dreams in stillness creep.

The larks ascend, their songs ascend,
   As sunbeams chase the starry night;
In nature’s arms, we find a friend,
   A love that blooms with morning light.


- L M T Aitken
