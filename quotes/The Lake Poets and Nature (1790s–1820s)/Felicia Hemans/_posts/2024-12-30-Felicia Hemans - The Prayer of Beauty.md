The Prayer of Beauty

As twilight gathers, softly falls the night,
Awake my heart to the wonders of the wild;
Let whispers of the stars draw me to their light,
O radiant beauty! In thy calm, I’m reconciled.

For in the quietness of evening’s grace,
As breezes breathe through leaves that bend and sway,
Let every moment hold a sacred place,
To cherish all that blooms upon my way.

In every flower, let me find my prayer,
In every sunset, feel thy warm embrace,
With gratitude, I bring thee my care,
To witness the world’s beauty, in every place.

O Nature! With thy beauty doth my spirit soar,
Forever blessed by every gift you bore.

—Felicia Hemans
