The Question
In the silence of night where the dreamers pass,
And the moon is a coffin, where together lie,
The fading dreams of the trees and the grass,
That whisper each question they could not reply.
For softly the shadows a-breathing shall wake,
With hints of the flowers that follow the dew,
To blend with the nightingale's song when it shakes
The air with a passion that only stars knew.
