The Hidden Vale
 
In a hidden vale, where wildflowers grow,  
Beneath the arching branches’ embrace,  
A world untouched by time’s cruel flow,  
Whispers the secrets of its grace.  

With every rustle of the leaves,  
A tale unfolds of love and lore,  
In nature’s heart, the spirit weaves,  
A sanctuary to explore.

- Edward Burne-Jones
