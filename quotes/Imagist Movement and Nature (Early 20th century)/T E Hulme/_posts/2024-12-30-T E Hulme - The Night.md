The Night

Starlight twines through slumber,
With quiet breaths it blends,
Where night her shroud weaves softly,
In velvet ties that bend.

A hush, a glow, a shadow,  
Transforms a day once bright,
As sighs collect like whispers,
The hush of tranquil night.

Crickets drone their ballads,  
In orchestras of dreams,
While moonlight beams from high,
And into slumber seams.

World above a hidden breath,  
With cradled thoughts shall sail,
On currents of the night,  
Where silence sends its trail.

- T E Hulme
