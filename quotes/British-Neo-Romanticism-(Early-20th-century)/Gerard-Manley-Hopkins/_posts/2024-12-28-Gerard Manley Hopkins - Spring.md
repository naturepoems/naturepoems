Spring

Nothing is so beautiful as spring—
  When all the birds are singing,
  And everything is ringing;

  The hills are all a-golden,
  And the world is simply holden--
  With the beauty it is bringing!

  The little lambs are playing,
  The flowers, they are swaying,
  And the voices in the valleys,

  In the breeze’s vibrant alleys
  All the glorious things I’m saying
  Are what my heart is saying,

  Spring is here!  Oh, joy it brings!
  All nature wakes and sings!

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
