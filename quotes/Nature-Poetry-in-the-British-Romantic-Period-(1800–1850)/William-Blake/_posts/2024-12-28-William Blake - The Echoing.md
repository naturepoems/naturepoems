The Echoing Green
The sun does arise,
And make happy the skies;
The merry bells ring
To welcome the spring;
The sky-lark and thrush,
The birds of the bush,
Sing louder around
To the bells’ cheerful sound,

While our sports shall be seen
On the Echoing Green.

Old John with white hair
Does laugh away care,
Sitting under the oak,
Among the old folk;
They laugh at our play,
And soon they all say,
‘How happy we were
When we lived here before!
‘

The sky-lark and thrush,
The birds of the bush,
Sing louder around
To the bells’ cheerful sound,

While our sports shall be seen
On the Echoing Green.

- William Blake
