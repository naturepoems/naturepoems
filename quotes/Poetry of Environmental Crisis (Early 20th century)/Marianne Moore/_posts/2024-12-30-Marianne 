Sea Unicorn

Far back behind light's veil, he moves
 surrounded with a bloom of glistening,
 the pile of muscles, at most, serene,
 as in form, sands of mandarin, weightless as leaves
 contrast themselves against scrolling waves—- 
 its fin shall whistle when tasked for bracing foam;
 a solemn trace beneath the cradle of greens— 
 an artist may spell at charms——
 to seize the flows wanting no thought; 
 but softly at first you see the tails
 arrayed in darkened brightness. 
  
—Marianne Moore
