Whispers of the Wind

When the wind calls softly through the trees,
It carries a message upon the breeze,
With rustling leaves like whispers of lore,
Tales of the ancients, forgotten no more.

It sweeps through the valleys, dances on peaks,
In its gentle embrace, nature speaks,
Songs of the earth, the sea and the sky,
In every cool gust, the world sings bye.

Listen close, for the wind tells of fate,
Stories of life, from the small to the great,
In the hush of the night, or bright of the day,
Nature’s sweet breath will always convey.
