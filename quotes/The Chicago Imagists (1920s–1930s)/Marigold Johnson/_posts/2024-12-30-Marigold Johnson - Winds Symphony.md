Wind’s Symphony

The wind's sweet symphony fills the air,
With every note, a story spins,
It dances through the trees laid bare,
And through the fields where life begins.

With laughter bright, it twirls and sways,
Through valleys low and mountains high,
In nature’s choir, it sings all day,
In harmony with earth and sky.

- Marigold Johnson
