The Locust Tree in Flower
The locust tree in flower
is a great blank bush
of white flowers,
like spring snow.
On all sides
huddled close together
are the houses.

In their doors and windows
white flowers
spill out on the sky;
everywhere the light
pressed down
an irresistible white hint
in the brightness of the day.

The good white women
move among the trees,
greatly pleased
by this wreathing
of the world

- William Carlos Williams
