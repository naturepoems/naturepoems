In the Woodlands

In sacred silence, deeper still than sleep,
The woodland breathes upon the shrinking day,
While twilight’s shadows in their chambers creep,
And skimming breezes, soft as whispered play.

Each bough and branch, with duty’s frost-bond laid,
Uplifts its arms, and seems to dream and bless;
A sanctuary still, the cool and shade—
Therein, I find my joyous rest and press.

- Paul Hamilton Hayne
