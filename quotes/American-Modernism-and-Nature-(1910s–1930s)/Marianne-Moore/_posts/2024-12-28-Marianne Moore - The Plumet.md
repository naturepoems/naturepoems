The Plumet Finale

The heavy of their approach,
unbelonging in an arsenal;
but the simple “t-t” of wings
is a strength created,

and repaired into shapes.

What fragile fishers
with wings disappear
replay their echo of the surface,

hatching darkness suspended
from fellow colors,
shocked skin like clearing terrain.

Or through breathing,
everyone leaves the air,
it murmurs precious in the sun.

—Marianne Moore
