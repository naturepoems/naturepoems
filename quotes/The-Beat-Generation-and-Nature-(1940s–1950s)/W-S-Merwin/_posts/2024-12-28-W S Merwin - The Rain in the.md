The Rain in the Trees
by W. S. Merwin

I could not tell you
other than the rain
that changes
yes it changes
still it is there
it is coming down
as it did there
my happy feet
with gravel stones
listen as the trees
listen as I
at the back
hear the voices
of the leaves where it is
falling in the words
I will remember
this in the spring
and in the bloom
of the tree beside me.

- W S Merwin
