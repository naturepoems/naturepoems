O river of reflection,
Your currents pull the heart,
In your depths, I see the heavens,
Art of nature's whispered art.
Dancing on your vibrant surface,
Is the light of stars above,
Each ripple carries dreams of ages,
In your arms, I find my love.
Whispering willows bend in reverence,
As the world in quiet sleeps,
While the earth abides your beauty,
In the silence, the heart leaps.

- Marina Tsvetaeva
