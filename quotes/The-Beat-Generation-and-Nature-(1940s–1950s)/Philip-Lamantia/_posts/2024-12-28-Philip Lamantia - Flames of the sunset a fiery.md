Flames of the sunset, a fiery line,
Brush against the mountains divine,
Each hue reflects the heart’s embrace,
In the twilight's glow, we find our place.

Meadows stretching beyond the hills,
Whispers of wind carry ancient thrills;
As echoes of laughter entwine the air,
In nature’s arms, we find we share.
