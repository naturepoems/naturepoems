The fragrance of the morning dew,  
On petals kissed by dawn's first light,  
Awakens dreams, both fresh and new,  
In nature's grasp, all things feel right.

With every breath, I taste the air,  
So rich with life, so pure, so clear,  
In every leaf, a love affair,  
In natureâ€™s arms, I have no fear.

- Hjalmar Hegner
