The Sea

As liquid scintillation,
the sea leads to images,
that reactuate their solid,
the swell of it—
this braved horizon assists
each forming arm in its water,
the weather of dry in the air.

To hold fragility in flashes,
attention tenses in tentacles free,
to ride softly, as waves:
what ease, I am the burden of unturning—
submitting gradually as depths are gone
over what augury touch.


- Marianne Moore
