River Song

The river is singing  
  the song of my dead.  
  I lay in the grass  
 
And watched the clouds  
  slip anywhere  
  out of the sea  
 
before the clouds drift  
  again to the sky;  
And I feel again, too,  
  the moisture stir inside  
 
At night,  
  while the river sings,  
  the song  
that murmur within,  
 
Thus turns the wheel,  
  round by a soft brush,  
like a mother stroking  
  the curved back of a child.
