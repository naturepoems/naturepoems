The Moon and the Yew Tree  
  
     A light that binds the day,  
     And shrouded yet bold,  
     In the haunting folds,  
     The crescent tree there lies,  
     With all its shade enfolded.  
     The wind will scrawl  
     In secret calls,  
     Just as the moon will pause  
     To illuminate the cold  
     Bare limbs that to the sky  
     Speak the silent story told.  


- Robert Browning
