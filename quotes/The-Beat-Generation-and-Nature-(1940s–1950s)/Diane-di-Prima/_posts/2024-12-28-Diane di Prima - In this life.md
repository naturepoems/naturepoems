In this life  
you must breathe,
make the thrill of being,  
dance high in trees
like a sylvan being,  
fall out of worldly bones
into starry roots.
Nestle between sun, night,
and bright pebbled streams,
for life’s but a single  
early word of nature’s songs,:
those without time  
like vision’s dreams.
