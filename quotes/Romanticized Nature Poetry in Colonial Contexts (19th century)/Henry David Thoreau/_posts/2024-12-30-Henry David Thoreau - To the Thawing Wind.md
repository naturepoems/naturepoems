To the Thawing Wind
---

Welcoming winds, that carry the sighs,
Of sweet rebirth beneath the skies,
Where winter's grasp begins to fade,
And tender life finds its cascade.

You whisper warmth to frozen ground,
With every breath, a change profound,
The sap begins its steady rise,
In hope, we watch for springtime’s eyes.

---

So let us witness time unwind,
In nature’s lap, hearts intertwined.


- Henry David Thoreau
