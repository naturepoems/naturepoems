Among the Nightingales

The swollen buds tower,
Roots deep in black loam;  
      While echoes of air nestle,
  In the cramped shadows.  
There, the swarm hovers,
Through ruffled feathers,
      And the dusk sways the tree,
To the soft steps of night.

Oh ye night song—the few arise,
In tremolo of whispers,
Am I a child of the sylvan glade?
Who knows the way back,
If they are drowned in sweet song,
To the mouth of the dawn?

— H.D. (Hilda Doolittle)
