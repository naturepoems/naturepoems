The rolling hills, a painter's brush,
In shades of green and gold stroke wide,
Where valleys meet in gentle hush,
And rivers flow, nature's guide.

The sun will rise, the moon will fall,
In cycles spinning, we heed the call,
Nature's heart beats on and on,
In every dusk, a promise drawn.

- Duncan Grant
