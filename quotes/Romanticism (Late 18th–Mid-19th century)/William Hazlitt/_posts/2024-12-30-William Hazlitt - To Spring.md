To Spring  

O thou who passest thro' our vallies in  
   Thy Chariot of the Sun,  
Thou who so oft hast thy way  
   In frugal rain and change,  
Whose soft embrace awakens all,  
   With the blossoms of thy love!  

The flowers in their prayer  
   Seek Thy fragrant breath,  
The winds of cool, brief slumber,  
   Reviving slumber, wrought  
From solid, nourishing earth;  
   And the rustle of the boughs  
To a gentle song doth turn.  

The cracked woods, on thy way  
Stand limned in full and green;  
Bright Meadows, each steep hath  
   A gleaning of Thine approval!  
With Thee, dear Spring, I long to rest,  
   With every nook and glade!

- William Hazlitt
