Days of yellow sunlit glow,
Promenade those shady paths,
Where trees do toss in nightly show,
And break the silent laughs.

Inruptured beauty surrounds,
The fields oft call to grace,
With bright wildflowers pink abound,
Cascading time and space.

I wander, holding breath to taste,
The birds along the way,
Each step a dance, and leaves embraced,
Another kiss of day.

In twilight under blushing skies,
The glow begins to smile,
With whispers soft of wordless sighs,
As evening draws me nigh.

Let shadows play on heavenâ€™s edge,
And dusk bring forth the night,
For once again to nature stirred,
My heart delights tonight.


- James Joyce
