A NIGHT IN THE WOODS

I.
In shadows deep where silence reigns,
The moon weaves through the tender leaves,
In the insistent breath of wind, refrains,
While the heart seeks what heaves.

II.
How soft the murmured cries, gently bring,
Amidst the trees and the midnight throng,
From some sweet place where wild things sing,
Their song of night, forever long.

III.
A firefly flutters, a distant star,
In this realm where dreams unfold,
Within the wood, all fears afar,
To keep us warm with tales retold.

IV.
So gather round this darkened gleam,
May secrets float and time alight,
For nature knows the heart’s a dream,
In a night where the woods delight!

- John Gibson Lockhart
