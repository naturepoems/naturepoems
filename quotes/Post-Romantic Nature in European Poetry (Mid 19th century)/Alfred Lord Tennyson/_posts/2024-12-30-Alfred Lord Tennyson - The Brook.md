The brook flows through the valley clear,
Dancing and gleaming, laughing and leaping;
It whispers and sings unto the weir,
And lingers and ripples while ever keeping.

'Tis a music from far, and a voice from the wood,
A gentle voice that a heart may soothe.
In its depths, where peace has stood,
The soul is fed, and the spirit moves.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
