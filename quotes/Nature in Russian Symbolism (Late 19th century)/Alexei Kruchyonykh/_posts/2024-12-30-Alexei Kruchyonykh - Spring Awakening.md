Spring Awakening
With a soft touch, spring kisses the ground,
Nature shakes off its slumber, unbound.
Bud bursts into bloom, a riot of hue,
In this vibrant dance, life feels anew.

The song of the birds, a jubilant cheer,
Echoing joy as warmth draws near.
Every petal, a promise, every breeze, a chance,
In the arms of spring, we find our dance.

- Alexei Kruchyonykh
