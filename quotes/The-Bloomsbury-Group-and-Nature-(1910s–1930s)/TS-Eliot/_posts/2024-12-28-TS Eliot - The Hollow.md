The Hollow Men

We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!
Our dried voices, when
We whisper together
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass
Or rats’ feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar.  

Shape without form, shade without colour,
Paralysed force, gesture without motion.

Those who have crossed
With direct eyes, to death’s other Kingdom
Remember us – if at all – not as lost
Violent souls, but only
As the hollow men
The stuffed men.

Eyes I dare not meet in dreams
In death’s dream kingdom
These do not appear:
There, the eyes are.

In this last of meeting places
We gather at the precipice,
Greeted by a silhouette
Of shadows held extended to the light.
Keep courage—we need to wait.

Between the idea
And the reality
Between the motion
And the act
Falls the Shadow.

For thine is the Kingdom.  

Waving praying for the present,  
In substance we seek to glean.
May shadows gracefully retreat.  

Life spins in quaint moments and time,
Enticing past and present in motion to play;  
Leading life’s length.  
Where from stillness weeks drift, bend slowly to dawn.


- TS Eliot
