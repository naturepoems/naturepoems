Steel and stone, 
concrete jungles rise, 
but nature whispers still 
in the rustle of trees, 
the kiss of blossoms.

Each petal, a note, 
a melody carried on wings,
defying the siren calls 
of mechanized din, 
reminders of beauty’s grace.

The sun's title—
Master of Ceremonies,
takes center stage, 
while shadows create depth 
in this landscape of life.

- Gino Severini
