THE EVENING

Night flies and the larks give way,
   To vapor trails in blue.
Where silence lingers through the day,
   And whispers hold the dew.

The stars they shine, and I reflect;
   A candle in the dark.
With life to grasp, and joy to detect,
   As evening makes its mark.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
