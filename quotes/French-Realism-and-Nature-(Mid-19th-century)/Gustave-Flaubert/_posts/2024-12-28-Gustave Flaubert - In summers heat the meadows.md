In summer's heat, the meadows sway,
Tall grasses dance to the windâ€™s soft tune,
Beneath the warmth of the golden day,
Life blooms in vibrant hues that croon.

Bees hum sweetly, busy with mirth,
Collecting nectar from fragrant blooms,
Nature's enterprise, a cycle of love,
In these fields, joy forever looms.

- Gustave Flaubert
