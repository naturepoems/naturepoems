The Sun’s Eye

Here what a land 
there’s left to me! 
    The dark rock, 
in the dappled shade,  
where the ferns 
grow lushly at the base,
    The white blossom,  
windswept from the tree, 
    eavesdrop on my thoughts.

You are the light of my land, 
    the shadow at dusk, 
my core, and my cover.  
And in your eyes,  
the beauty of worms 
    and in your sighs,  
a hundred summers.  
As if to bless 
the silver blossoms in the wake.  
    Enjoyment!  
Happy balance with grace and time!  
When spirits draw close,
it is but your quiet  
    knowledge that heals.

- R S Thomas
