It is a beauteous evening, calm and free,
The holy time is quiet as a Nun
Breathless with adoration; the broad sun
Is sinking down in its tranquillity;

The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the Sea:
Listen! The mighty Being is awake,
And doth with his eternal motion make
A sound like thunderâ€”everlastingly.

I only listened to the sea and sky;
The glimmering waves, the sails that go and come,
The breeze blows fresh; I heard it all in time,
How sweet the sighing of a harmless sigh.

The hour comes, the boat must leave the bay,
But listen! Time recedes from my own ear,
As darkness deepens into light and day.


- William Wordsworth
