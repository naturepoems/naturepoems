Distance hides it, the sun-sweet air;
The moans of the sea in the twilit night.
The gloom of the sycamores where shadows creep,
Whispers of peace, soft as velvet sleep.

Tâ€™ward the ocean, I wander alone,
The rose of the sunset toward darkness blown,
With twilight sprinkled in splendor around,
In the breath of the wind, the music of sound.

Dew hangs on the grass, like jewels of the morn,
Life awakes gently, the day to be born.
Each leaf in its rustle, each creature a hymn,
Nature enraptures the soul in its dim.

- Frank Norris
