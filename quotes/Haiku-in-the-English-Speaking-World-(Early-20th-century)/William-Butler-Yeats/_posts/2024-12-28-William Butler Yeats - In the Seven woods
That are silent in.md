title: "William Butler Yeats - In the Seven woods
That are silent in"
date: 2024-12-28 12:00:00 -0000
author: William Butler Yeats
quote: "In the Seven woods
That are silent in their frown,
Is the kind of silence
Of the trees blown by the wind;
But they are strong and dark
With the sun of early autumn,
And all before them lies again,
An ancient crack in the frost.
What of the swift now\?
The skin of the fox is all the light,
The moor is long gone to grain,
And even the dead are painful.
When the voice is far away,
What closes the voice in the dusk?
Which one of them lives,
And if they ask an answer
Echo all the past times through
Till you know it all again."

In the Seven woods
That are silent in their frown,
Is the kind of silence
Of the trees blown by the wind;
But they are strong and dark
With the sun of early autumn,
And all before them lies again,
An ancient crack in the frost.
What of the swift now\?
The skin of the fox is all the light,
The moor is long gone to grain,
And even the dead are painful.
When the voice is far away,
What closes the voice in the dusk?
Which one of them lives,
And if they ask an answer
Echo all the past times through
Till you know it all again.

- William Butler Yeats
