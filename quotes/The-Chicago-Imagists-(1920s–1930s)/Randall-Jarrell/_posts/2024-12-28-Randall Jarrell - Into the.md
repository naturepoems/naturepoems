Into the Forest
    Tread wide and slow, to step—
    The heart caught, every garden cloned,
    Each shedding leaves, whispering
    All dreams captured, fading bliss.

    Trees holding secrets, their layered truth,
    Are massive hands that grow the air,
    Touching lightly each passing dusk—
    Where the world dims quietly, unseen.

- Randall Jarrell
