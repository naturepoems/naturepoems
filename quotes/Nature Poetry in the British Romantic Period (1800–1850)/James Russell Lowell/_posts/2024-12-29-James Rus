The Garden

In the garden’s quiet embrace,
  I wander through blooms of every hue;
The joy of nature fills each space,
  A world of wonder to pursue.

With daisies bright and roses bold,
  Each petal whispers tales of grace;
The stories of the sun unfold,
  In this enchanted, sacred place.

Oh, let me dwell amidst the vines,
  Where fragrant touches linger near;
With laughter carried by the winds,
  Each moment wrapped in nature’s cheer.

The hum of bees and songs of thrush,
  With colors dancing in the light;
Amidst the peace, my heart can hush,
  In this garden, my soul takes flight.

Oh, nature’s bliss, so sweet, sincere,
  Allows my worries to depart;
In this embrace I hold most dear,
  I find the beauty of my heart.

- James Russell Lowell
