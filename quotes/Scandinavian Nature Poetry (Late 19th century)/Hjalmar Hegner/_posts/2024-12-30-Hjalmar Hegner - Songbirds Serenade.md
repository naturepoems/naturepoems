The songbirds trill from heights above,  
Each note a thread that weaves the air,  
In harmony, they sing of love,  
In every branch, a world laid bare.

Through valleys deep and mountains high,  
Their melodies will always roam,  
A celebration, a lullaby,  
In natureâ€™s heart, I find my home.

- Hjalmar Hegner
