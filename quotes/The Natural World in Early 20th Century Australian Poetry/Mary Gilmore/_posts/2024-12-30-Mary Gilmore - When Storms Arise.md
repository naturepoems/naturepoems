When Storms Arise

When storms arise in nature’s womb,
  And clouds come rolling south,
Let not the fury wreck your doom,
  Nor silence steal your mouth.

For in the tempest’s torrid rage,
  A beauty lies unseen;
Each flash of light, each whispered page,
  Holds truth that lies between.

So stand and face the winds of fate,
  Lift up your heart in strife;
For through the blows of nature's gate,
  The storms will give you life.


- Mary Gilmore
