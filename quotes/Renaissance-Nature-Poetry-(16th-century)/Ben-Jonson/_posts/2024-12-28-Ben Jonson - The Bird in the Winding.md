The Bird in the Winding Wood
How sweet the song that breaks the hush of morn,
When verdant leaves in gentle dance are shown;
For here in woods where shadowed peace is born,
The lark shall rise and bid the day be grown.

In winding paths, the echoes find their place,
As melodies intertwine, they seem to play,
A serenade that dances with the grace,
Of every note, that whispers loveâ€™s display.

So let my heart be lifted by this cheer,
Where nature sings, and time steps lightly by;
For every breeze that carries back the year,
Awakens dreams beneath the boundless sky.


- Ben Jonson
