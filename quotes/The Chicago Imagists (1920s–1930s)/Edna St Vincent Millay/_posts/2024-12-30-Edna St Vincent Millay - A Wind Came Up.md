A wind came up out of the west,  
                     So rare  
                    And so shiver of carols that rest,  
                    Turning my cheeks  
                     A cloud of slow descending,  
                    Until the day bows low,  
                     In velvet blue,  
                     Ebbing the edges of sight  
                    All change,  
                     And the tremble of the flying-cut water  
                         And the draw of the night,  
                    As I wander,  
                       Through stars beyond,  
                   And follow the breath of sea.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
