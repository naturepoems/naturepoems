In autumn's chill, the leaves descend,
A carpet woven, floor unpenned.
With each gust of wind, a swirling flight,
Colors burst forth, a pure delight.

Natureâ€™s canvas, smeared and bold,
Hues of crimson, brown, and gold.
A fleeting moment, a precious time,
Autumn dances, a grand sublime.


- Henry James
