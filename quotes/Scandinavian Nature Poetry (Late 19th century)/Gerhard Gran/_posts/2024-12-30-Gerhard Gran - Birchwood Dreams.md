Amongst the birch trees, silver-white,
A gentle breeze begins to breathe,
With rustling leaves that dance in light,
A symphony, nature's wreath.

Each rustle carries secrets shared,
Of seasons past and days to come,
In this tranquility, I've bared,
The soul of earth, the heart's sweet drum.

- Gerhard Gran
