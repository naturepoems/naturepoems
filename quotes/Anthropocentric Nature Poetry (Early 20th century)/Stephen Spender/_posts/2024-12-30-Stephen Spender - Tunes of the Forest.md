And so I stumbled among the forms,
A trove of shapes molded by winds,
Each step an unmarked chapter,
Where roots run deep, like love unspoken.

The light drips through branches,
Framing the entrance of the woods,
Where each leaf tells a story,
Of the ages spent in their shade.

And in this bubbling silence,
Life thrums with the pulse of existence,
As bees hum melody to petals,
The earth, breathing out all it knows.

- Stephen Spender
