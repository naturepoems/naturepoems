TO A POET A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE

O not to a man—delightful lands,
   Or tides that paint the shores,
But to what blooms henceforth will rise,
   As I beneath the floors.

For where May flowers greet the sun,
   And honeyed winds arise,
Your beauty goes and lingers on,
   In nature’s grand disguise.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
