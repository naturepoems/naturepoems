Beneath the canopy,
Where light flickers and fades,
Life dances in the shadows,
As nature breathes—
A heart painted with vibrant life.

Birds flutter in secret hymns,
While the sun weaves gold into whispers,
And the woods become a sanctuary,
Where dreams take flight,
On the wings of freedom.


- Louise Bogan
