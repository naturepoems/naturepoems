A babbling brook, so pure, cascades around,
Where flowers bloom, and verdant prospects play,
In sylvan dreams, natureâ€™s heart is found,
With every breath, a renewal of the day.

Enchanted woods where emerald shadows dance,
Amid the azure skies, the pathways lay,
Inviting wanderers, drawing them to chance,
As whispers of the wild serenely sway.

And so I travel through this splendid earth,
With nature as my guide, my spirit flies,
Each leaf and breeze cradling my worth,
In every sight, the wild beauty never dies.

- John Clare
