The Garden

Out of the darkness of the fenceless past
A garden climbs the walls of spring’s awakening,
The shadowed and the lighted paths entwined,
Strewn with great petals of the fading rose.
And in its walled enclosure, we shall find,
A voice that calls, a whisper soft and low
That mingles with the twilight and the dew,
And bids the heart bloom large beyond its bounds.

- Amy Lowell
