To the Light

   My love is seen
   Iridescent streams of gold—
   Turn free our tree through the dim
   twilight afternoon,
   a bough of the blue over-arching
   above us, green as thoughts of beginnings.
   I sense all the stirrings,
   a claw of sunlight—
   dipping into shadow—
   how a sprig of green dips low.
