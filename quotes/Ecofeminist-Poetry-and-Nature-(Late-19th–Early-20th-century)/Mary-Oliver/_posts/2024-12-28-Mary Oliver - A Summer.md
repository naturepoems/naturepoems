A Summer Day

I had to keep my life simple and good
so that flowers, animal, and heart
could dwell together.

And I watched a dragonfly circle,
decked in the summer light,
a pure glowing delight,

sipping the honey from the blooms.
There were creatures all about me,
making possible, this one reality,

headlong into green.
And I would drink deeply of the sunlight
which only God could understand.
