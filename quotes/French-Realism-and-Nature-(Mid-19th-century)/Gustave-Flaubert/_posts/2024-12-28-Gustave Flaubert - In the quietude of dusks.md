In the quietude of dusk’s embrace,
Where the horizon blurs, and shadows blend,
A gentle sigh of the evening breeze,
Carries each promise to its end.

Stars peep forth as the darkness deepens,
Each twinkling light, a distant song,
In the heart of night, nature whispers,
Her secrets of right and wrong.

- Gustave Flaubert
