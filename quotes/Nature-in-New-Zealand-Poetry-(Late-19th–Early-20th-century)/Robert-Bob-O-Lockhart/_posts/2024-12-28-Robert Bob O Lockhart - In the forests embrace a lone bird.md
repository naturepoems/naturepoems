In the forest’s embrace, a lone bird sings,
Through the canopy where the sunlight clings,
The rustling leaves share secrets profound,
In the heart of the wild, truth can be found.

Every branch, a story unwinds,
Of the dance of the seasons, the passage of time,
In the hush of the woods, listen and know,
Nature speaks softly where wildflowers grow.

- Robert Bob O Lockhart
