O, the mist of morn doth spread,
A gentle veil on nature's face,
Like dreams that wander in moonlight's thread,
It wraps soft shadows with such grace.
The whispering brook beneath the bush
Sings sweetly of the day anew,
A world untouched, in silence, hush,
In Nature's arms, a love so true.

- George Gordon Lord Byron
