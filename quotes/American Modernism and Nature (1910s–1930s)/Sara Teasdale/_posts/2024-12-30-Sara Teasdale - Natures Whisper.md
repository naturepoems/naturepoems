From fields of clover to peaks of snow,
each corner of earth holds a song.
The cries of nature resound,
a chorus calling each moment home.

Listen to the trees, oh they speak,
with voices roughened by the years.
They hold the stories of seasons past,
a testament written in bark and leaves.

Every breeze carries memories,
every star a promise anew,
a reminder that we are all part of it,
each day a brush with eternity.

- Sara Teasdale
