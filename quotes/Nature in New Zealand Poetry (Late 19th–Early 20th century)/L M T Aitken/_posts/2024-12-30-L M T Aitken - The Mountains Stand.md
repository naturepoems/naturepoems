The mountains stand, a fortress grand,
   Where crags like rocky castles rise;
Beneath their shadow, cool and green,
   The vale in peace and beauty lies.

The rivers flow, a silver thread,
   Through meadows rich with vernal bloom,
While forest depths, with whispering leaves,
   Invite the hunter's happy gloom.


- L M T Aitken
