Through gardens green and paths of light,
Where shadows dance and laughter plays,
I wander on through day and night,
With natureâ€™s beauty to amaze.
For every step upon this earth,
Brings joy and wonder ever new,
In every flower, there lies a mirth,
A song that speaks straight to the true.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
