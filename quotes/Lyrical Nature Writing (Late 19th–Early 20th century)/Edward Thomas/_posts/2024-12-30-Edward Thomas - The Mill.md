The Mill

I heard the mill go round and round,
Its motion a soothing lullaby,
As the water rushed with a gentle sound,
Underneath the sun-tinged sky.

Around the wheel, the bright splash played,
A dance of light, as the wheel would sway,
And dreams formed in the shade, unfrayed,
As nature’s soft whispers led my way.

I felt the pulse of life within,
The strength of earth and the wind’s decree,
In the mill's hum, I found my kin,
Nature’s embrace, forever free.


- Edward Thomas
