River's Lament

Flowing on and on,
Through the vale and the glen,
You sing a soft song,
To the stones and the fen.

Crystalline and pure,
Your waters reflect,
The skies' endless blue,
In soft, rippling effect.

Oh river of whispers,
In your gentle quest,
You cradle the world,
In your flowing nest.

- John Thompson
