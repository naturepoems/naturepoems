The Rimu's Song

In every whisper of the tall rimu trees,  
I hear the ancients sway with the breeze,  
Their leaves like laughter, soft and low,  
As the forest dances, time flows slow.

With trunks that tell tales of storms weathered long,  
They cradle the memories, the heart of our song,  
In the winds they reveal their wisdom and grace,  
The spirit of nature, our sacred space.

Oh, rimu, you stand as a guardian true,  
In your shade, we gather, find strength anew,  
For in every moment spent by your side,  
We feel the connection, and the world opens wide.

- P E J M Taylor
