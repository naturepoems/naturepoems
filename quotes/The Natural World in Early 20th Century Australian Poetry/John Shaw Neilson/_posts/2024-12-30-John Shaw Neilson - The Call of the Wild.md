The Call of the Wild

The call of the wild is a voice I hear,
    That beckons me each day;
From mountains high to valleys clear,
    It leads my feet away.

For in the depth of Nature’s thrum,
    I feel my spirit soar;
And wild with joy I’ll ever come,
    To cherish wild once more.

- John Shaw Neilson
