The clouds drift languid on a blue vast expanse,
While the sun kisses petals, a soft waking sigh,
Each flower a dancer in nature's grand dance,
The air, thick with perfume, lush as it passes by.
Surrender I will to this bright, fleeting day,
For here in the moment, my heart learns to fly.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
