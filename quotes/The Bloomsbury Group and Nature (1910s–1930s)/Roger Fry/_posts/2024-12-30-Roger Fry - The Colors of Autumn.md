The colors of the autumn trees,
 A canvas splashed by gentle breeze,
 Each leaf that flutters slowly down,
 A moment captured, in golden crown.

 The crackling underfoot I tread,
 Reminds me of what nature said,
 To cherish each, both strong and frail,
 In every tale that leaves a trail.


- Roger Fry
