The Loon
---

Whence this appeal that is not of the earth,
The song of the Loon, that from dusk to dawn,
Wails its plaint on a lonely river,  
And haunts the shore like a ghostly star.  
O wondrous, plaintive cry, so far away!
Body of a feathered fish, ghostly as light,  
Born of the water and dead to the air.

---

Love of nature as spiritual companionship,  
The woods, the streams,  
In the summer's late, quiet light.

---

Subtle and sweet is the mood of the night.


- Henry David Thoreau
