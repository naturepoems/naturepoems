The mountain tops, so bold and high,
Do reach and touch the azure skies;
Their rugged form and ancient cliff,
Reflect the time, so old, so stiff.

In every stone, in every peak,
The stories of the earth do speak;
Of ages past and times yet come,
A world alive with beating drum.

So let us climb and find our view,
To see the world in colors new;
For in the heights, the spirit feels,
The pulse of life that nature heals.

- Hannah More
