The Hills
O’er hills and dales, my heart shall roam,

With every step, I feel at home,

The grass beneath and sky above,

Nature speaks the language of love.

Through every turn, a mystery waits,

Infinite joys opening gates,

To wonder in the views so grand,

In nature’s arms, by her command.

- Richard Jefferies
