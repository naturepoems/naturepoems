Starlit Path

O path that winds through ancient trees,
Beneath the starlit sky you lie;
Your secrets hold the gentle breeze,
As nature’s lullaby drifts by.

Each step I take, a dream unfolds,
In shadow’s arms, a tranquil peace;
The mystery that night beholds,
In every heartbeat finds release.

- Rosa Zagnoni Marinone
