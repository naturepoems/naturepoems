Dawn's Gentle Light
As dawn unfurls her golden wings,
A hush descends on sleeping earth,
The world awakens, softly sings,
Her beauty wrapped in quiet mirth.
In hues of pink and lavender skies,
Each petal opens, fresh and new,
Dew-kissed, kissed by natureâ€™s sighs,
Embrace the day, beckoning you.



- Julian Grenfell
