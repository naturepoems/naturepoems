By the River

                    I have gone too long without an anchor,
                    And now I know what it feels like, my heart
                    raw as unmended cloth.
                    
                    I walk beside the river, listening
                    to its crashing streams, feeling
                    the wretchedness of my soul.
                    
                    The waters dance about their confines;
                    It sings, it rumbles and sparkles,
                    as I sit, exhausted, bent, bare.
                    
                    Such a simple words as nature speaks,
                    with trembling leaves and mocking reeds,
                    the laughter wraps around my blight.
                    
                    I ache with childish joy and rage,
                    For Nature knows of woe and bliss,
                    she simply laughs and lets me lie.
                    
                    The cry of a bird soars overhead,
                    Bidding me to rise or linger.
                    And still it moves, that shimmering sheen.
                    
                    For among the stones and shifting sands,
                    The river's voice is such a balm,
                    it calls to me, whispering peace.
