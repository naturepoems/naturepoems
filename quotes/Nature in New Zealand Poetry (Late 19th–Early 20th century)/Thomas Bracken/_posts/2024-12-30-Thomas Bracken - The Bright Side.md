THE BRIGHT SIDE

I like the flowers that bloom in the wild;
I like the trees that wave in the breeze;
I like the stars that gleam in the night,
And the sunshine that floods the world with ease.

I like the streams that dance down the hills,
I like the mountains that tower so grand;
I like the valleys where silence thrills,
And the wide-eyed wonder of Nature's hand.

I like the birds that sing in the day;
I like the echoes that follow their notes;
I like the sun's last smile on the bay,
And the dream of night that around me floats.

For in these things there's a beauty rare,
A peace that soothes the troubled mind;
And though life's burdens I sometimes bear,
In Nature's arms I solace find.

- Thomas Bracken
