Kangaroo

One standing with his back to the sun;—
  The dusk on his body glows
Such colors!—the pregnant night is begun,
  And I am lost as he goes,

With the rush of the softening fields,
  O my heart bows to earth!
For the lilt of the rain, the music yields
  To the pulse of its worth.

O how the wind sings—how the stars pulse,
  In the curve of the earth’s wide dome,
As my heart runs wild, like the fluttering horse,
  I am far from the sun, far from home!

Yet I know the feel of the world on my skin,
  I crash, fall in from above,
Oh, naked I am where the dusk covers in,
  And I leap after the starry dove.

- David Campbell
