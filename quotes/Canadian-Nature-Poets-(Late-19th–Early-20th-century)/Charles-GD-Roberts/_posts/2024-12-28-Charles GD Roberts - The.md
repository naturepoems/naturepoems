The Dawn

The dawn breaks soft, a whispering sigh,
The pale sun stretching in the sky;
With golden light the world awakes,
As shadows lift from silent lakes.
  
In misty colors, pale and rare,
The morning hums a tender prayer;
As birds emerge and start their song,
The world in harmony belongs.
  
O timeless morn, thy beauty flows,
In every bud, each bloom that shows;
With grateful heart and open eyes,
In nature’s art my spirit flies.


- Charles GD Roberts
