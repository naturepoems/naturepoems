Cascading waterfalls, a silver veil,
a symphony that sings of freedom.

Sprays of mist kiss the rocks below,
a dance of water, wild and uncontained.

Let the sound fill your heart, let it guide you,
as you wade through pools of crystal dreams.

In the heart of the wild, let go, surrender,
and feel the pulse of nature's heartbeat.

- Kate Bush
