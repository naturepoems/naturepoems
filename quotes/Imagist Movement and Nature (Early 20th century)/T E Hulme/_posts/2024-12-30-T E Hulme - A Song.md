A Song

A hush fell deep,
The air became still,
I clove the branches,  
Untrammelled, waiting for joy.

The weeds formed a home within,
Green filaments brushed bright,
O, what do the skies say
In the dappled moonâ€™s flight?

Leaves whispered secrets,  
As they poured in blue streams,
Onward the day sauntered,
Mirth tints stained through seams.

I sang my furnace spirit,  
To flutter with desire,
As under the shrouded depths
The wood flames sent forth fire!
