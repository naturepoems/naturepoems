I little glen,
   I little bower,
   tired of the sound of water,
   I am a thorny bush,
   a blackbird watching,
   sovereign in my shrug.
Dust motes floating,
   and the Foxglove blooms, 
   punky trampled—
   farther away, laboring syntax
   - what is big enough,
   to avoid being ignored?

- Philip Whalen
