A Day of Sunshine

The sun, that is always, it’s always bright,  
The trees, whose shadows, dance in delight.  
The flowers bloom, a riotous hue,  
Nature awakes with the morning dew.

The brook doth babble, its silver note,  
While birds above in chorus float.  
Each leaf and blossom, a story to tell,  
In this paradise, all’s calm and well.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
