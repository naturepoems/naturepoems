In the heart of the forest,
Amidst the tall trees,
Sings the call of the wild,
On the whispering breeze.
Each leaf dances lightly,
In natural chorus,
Echoing softly,
With the wisdom of all of us.

The sun streaks through branches,
With fingers of flame,
And the shadows weave secrets,
In the hush of our name.
For there is magic here,
In this tranquil haven,
Where nature composes
The peace we are craving.

- Emily Carr
