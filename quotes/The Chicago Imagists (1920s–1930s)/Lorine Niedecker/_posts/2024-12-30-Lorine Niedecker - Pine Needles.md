Pine Needles

A pine tree
    leans to one side,
        a ditch toward the road.
    Needles slanting down
        are the heads going north.
    Roots don’t hold
        against storms,
    but drift out       
        in flows of the sun.
The wind blows sharp
    but the tree does not complain.
Yet,             
  with one hand reaching,
    it touces the ground.
                                      By shadows,
    I am changed.
