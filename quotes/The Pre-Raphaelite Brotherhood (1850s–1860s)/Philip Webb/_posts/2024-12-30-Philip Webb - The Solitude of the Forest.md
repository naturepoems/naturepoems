The Solitude of the Forest

In forest deep, the solace calls,
Where silence reigns, the stillness falls;
In whispered tones, the trees confer,
In every breath, the heart’s demur.

Among the ferns, I seek my peace,
In nature’s grace, the worries cease;
With every step beneath the shade,
In sacred woods, the fears will fade.

For in the solitude so rare,
Amidst the green, we breathe the air;
And in this quiet, life extends,
In the forest's arms, the heart transcends.


- Philip Webb
