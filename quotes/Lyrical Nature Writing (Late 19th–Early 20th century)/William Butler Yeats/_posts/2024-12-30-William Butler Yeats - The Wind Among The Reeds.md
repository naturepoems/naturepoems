The Wind Among The Reeds
Down by the salley gardens
My love and I did meet;
She passed the salley gardens
With little snow-white feet.

She bid me take love easy,
As the leaves grow on the tree;
But I being young and foolish
With her would not agree.

In a field down by the river
My love and I did stand,
And on my leaning shoulder
She laid her snow-white hand.

She bid me take life easy,
As the grass grows on the weirs;
But I was young and foolish,
And now am full of tears.

- William Butler Yeats
