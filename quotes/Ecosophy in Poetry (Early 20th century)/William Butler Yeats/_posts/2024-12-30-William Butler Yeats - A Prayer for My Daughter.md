A Prayer for My Daughter
May she be granted beauty without vanity,
And a warm heart without loss of temper,
And endless tenderness without regret,
A seeking heart and a mind of knowledge
That do not occupy in that fashion,
Forever disillusioning her sight.

May the good in every heart surround her,
Nurture her way firmly in right
And dirt can only be washed into dust
She will find that love, as those who come to her,
Is strong with righteous vows spoken.‚Äù

And in that love reject not any curse,
For those who have strength come from dark nights,
Give her the peace of fairy light
To breathe into her foolish unkindness
That the world needs nor the rise of the shaping storm.

- William Butler Yeats
