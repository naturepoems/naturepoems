In the quiet corners of the garden,
Time slows to the rhythm of the heart.
Petals form the softest carpets,
As dreams unfurl with the morning dew.

A bird calls, serenading the dawn,
Filling the air with delicate notes;
With every breath, nature's hymn resounds,
A glimpse of eternity in fleeting moments.

- Anna de Noailles
