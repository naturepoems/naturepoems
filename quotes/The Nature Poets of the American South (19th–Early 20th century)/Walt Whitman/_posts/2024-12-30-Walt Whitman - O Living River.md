O living river, cutting through,  
With the sounds of the tide crashing o’er the stones;  
I hear your voice intertwine with the birds  
That soar high, feeding off the bounty of the stars;  
You sing to me, dear river,  
Of times now past, and yet to come,  
For in your flow, I am forever home.

- Walt Whitman
