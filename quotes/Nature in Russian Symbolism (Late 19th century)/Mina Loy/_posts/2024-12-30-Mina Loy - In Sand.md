In Sand
Blades between grains,
you soft grip buried,
time seeping light,
sifting through like leaning silver —
the blurred image we hold weaknesses,
transparent—,
establish the luxury,
along the glossy grass-crowned hill,
or drown where defiance meets 
speculating halos—pure, fluid —
nature speaks of self, a plume of the curls,
a sensation of time piercing through,
hands clasp to life.


- Mina Loy
