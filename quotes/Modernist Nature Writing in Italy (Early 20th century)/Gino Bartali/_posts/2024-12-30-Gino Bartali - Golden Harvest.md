Fields of wheat sway,  
a sea of gold,  
a dance in the wind,  
a rhythm of abundance.  
Each stalk stands tall,  
a testament to the sun,  
a celebration of growth  
through the hands of labor.  

Harvest time beckons,  
a promise fulfilled,  
a gathering of bounty,  
a testament to life  
in all its vibrant glory.

- Gino Bartali
