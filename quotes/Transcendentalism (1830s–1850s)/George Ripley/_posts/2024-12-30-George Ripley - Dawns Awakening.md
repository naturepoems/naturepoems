In the light of dawn's first rays,  
A world reborn begins,  
Birdsong carries through the trees,  
Awakening the soul’s shy kin,  
To step within the day anew.

The meadows fresh with dew,  
Invite the heart to roam,  
To stretch and greet the sun,  
And plant dreams on this fertile loam,  
Where life’s beauty finds its home.


- George Ripley
