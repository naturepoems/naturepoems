I am a tree
Learning how to grow.
               From dark
           To light,
I break
       Through earth's crust,
            Reaching up,
               Towards
                   The sky.
Silent witness to the
Seasons cycle,
Falling
          Rising.
                       Stillness,  
The green nods, 
             And flourishes.

- Sylvia Plath
