The Mountain's Heart

Upon the mountain's rugged peak,
Where silence reigns and eagles soar,
The earth reveals its secrets meek,
In every crevice, every bore.

The jagged rocks, a story told,
Of ages past and futures bright,
In nature’s arms, both wild and bold,
The mountain whispers of the night.

- Marigold Johnson
