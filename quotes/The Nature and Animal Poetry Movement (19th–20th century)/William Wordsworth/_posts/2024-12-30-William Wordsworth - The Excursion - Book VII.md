This Beauty is not in the glare of works,
Or quenched as in the mirror; this is grace
Not fixed on earthly lot—not body’s ease.

I pass through vaults of darkness in my dreams,
And see for one last night their airy flame,
When starry eyes of children hide their tears,
And cloud-capped mountains fall upon the land.

- William Wordsworth
