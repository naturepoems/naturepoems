The Starlight Night
Look at the stars! look, look up at the skies!  
The lines of the universe are over us!  
And all is change that all in ruin lies,  
To be ador’d, to have been to us!  
In the silence these stars so wide and fair  
Limit each man’s thought, trace out his care.  
Let us kneel down and write it in 
Acts of the stars in heaven, and pray for light,  
In the full knowledge the very bond of man is fain,  
By destine to destroy it through night.  
For oft the stars attend us with their tears  
And down they drip on rocks and running streams,  
Where plants of rustling leaves, flower and green glens,  
Shall fade, as shadows soon in passing dreams.
