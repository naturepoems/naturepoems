The Streams

Where streams meet the hills, reflections so bright,  
Cascades weave a tale in their frolicking haste;  
While rippling along, they sing day and night,  
In nature’s embrace, where life’s joys are placed.

The purity glistens with droplets that gleam,  
Creating a mirror of beauty and love;  
So clear and so lovely, like a dream,  
Flowing onward and upward to stars up above.

So let the reverie pull me along,  
To the place where the rivers whisper and play;  
In the arms of the streams, I find where I belong,  
In the dance of the waters, I will ever stay.
