The woods are full of tender sounds,
   When daylight blends with twilight’s wing,
The quiet air in beauty found,
   Is warming every living thing.

The shadows dance and softly weave,
   Their stories told in whispers clear,
While nature’s heart, without reprieve,
   Invites us near, holds us dear.

- John Clare
