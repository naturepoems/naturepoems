The Meadow
In the meadow, soft and wide,
Where flowers bloom and glades abide,
The breeze carries laughter, sweet and free,
Life's vibrant palette, a joyous decree.
With butterflies dancing, in delightful play,
Nature's symphony calls, come what may,
In every petal, and every ray,
The heart finds solace, at the end of day.

- Louise Imogen Guiney
