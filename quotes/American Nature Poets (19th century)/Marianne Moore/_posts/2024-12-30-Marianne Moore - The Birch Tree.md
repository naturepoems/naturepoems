The Birch Tree

The silver birch stands luminous,
A sentinel in the twilight glow,
With branches that reach for the sky,
Bending in harmony with the winds,
As the aoe sky sculpts its waxen hue;
The gentility of the earth, the sea, the stars,
Forming a ring of magic here, in nature's arms.

- Marianne Moore
