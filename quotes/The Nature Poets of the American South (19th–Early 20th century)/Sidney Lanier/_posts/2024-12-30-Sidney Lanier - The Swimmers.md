The Swimmers
In the dark and icy fountain,
  When the morning breaks anew,
The rippling dancers swim and mountain
  Through the glittering light-washed blue.

And each plunging splatter sings
  Of joy and freedom, sweet and true;
As nature’s grace in ribbons flings,
  And evening’s peace wraps them too.

- Sidney Lanier
