Petals fall,
a silent rain,
turning pathways,
softer than whispers,
each one a farewell.
In the garden,
pinks and yellows,
vibrant, alive,
a riot of life,
delicate and bold,
a dance of color
under the watchful eye
of the sun.

Yet even here,
the breeze carries
stories untold,
secrets shared only
with the flowers,
who nod in time,
aware of the passing
of moments, of lives.

How wondrous,
this fragile balance,
a brief pause
in the midst
of chaos,
a soft sigh
of existence.

Let me gather
the petals as they fall,
reminders of beauty
and loss, a mind
splattered like paint
on a canvas of dirt.
There lies nature’s heart,
in every crumple,
a promise fulfilled.


- Alice Toklas
