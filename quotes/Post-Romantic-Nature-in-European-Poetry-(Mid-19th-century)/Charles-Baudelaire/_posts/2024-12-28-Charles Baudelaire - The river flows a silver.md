The river flows, a silver band,
Winding through the fields so green,
Beneath the sun, the golden land,
In all its splendor, pure, serene.

Leaves whisper secrets to the breeze,
As shadows play along the ground,
In nature’s arms, my spirit frees,
Where beauty’s echoes can be found.

- Charles Baudelaire
