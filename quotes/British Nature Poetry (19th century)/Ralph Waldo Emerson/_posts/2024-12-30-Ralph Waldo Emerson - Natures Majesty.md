The mountain sits at the center of the world,
Like a king upon his throne;
Its majesty is lost in the clouds,
Its beauty silently shone.

Each hour that passes, the sun will rise,
And cast its golden rays;
It gives the mountain life and love,
In a most extraordinary ways.

Ode to the mighty peaks that stand,
Unyielding through the years;
Their grandeur beckons from afar,
And soothes the soulâ€™s great fears.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
