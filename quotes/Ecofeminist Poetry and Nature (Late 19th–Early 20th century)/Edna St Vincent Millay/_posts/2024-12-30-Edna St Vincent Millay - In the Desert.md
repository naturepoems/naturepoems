IN THE DESERT

In the desert, over sand so deep,
   Something stirs but will not show.
A drop of rain like a fool does weep,
   And yet its worth does grow.

The night comes, crisp, but fears to fall,
   While moons of love do search the land.
So too the earth gives wide its call,
   As I perchance at hand.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
