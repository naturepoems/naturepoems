The Call of the Tui

In the twilight’s hush, the tui calls,  
A melody woven through the bushy walls,  
With notes like laughter, so wild, so free,  
A celebration of nature's harmony.

Perched on the branches, a jewel in the sun,  
You dance through the foliage, a song just begun,  
In the tapestry of life, you find your place,  
A spirit of freedom, a fleeting grace.

Sing on, dear tui, let your voice soar high,  
In the heart of our land, where dreams touch the sky,  
For in your sweet song, we find our delight,  
A reminder of beauty, both gentle and bright.

- P E J M Taylor
