GARDENS

In gardens where the green woodland sways,
And the air is rich with the blossoms' sigh,
The sun tilts through branches, in golden bays,
Painting shadows and light where dreams can lie.

Daisies dance among poppies, bright and clear,
As round-shape the grasses, in summer’s delight,
Emerging from silence, the beauty draws near,
In this place of peace, where each moment takes flight.

Hands that sow and love, not seeking reward,
Digging deep roots in the soil to abide—
Wonders of nature, ever adored,
In the heart of the gardens, where wild things bide.
