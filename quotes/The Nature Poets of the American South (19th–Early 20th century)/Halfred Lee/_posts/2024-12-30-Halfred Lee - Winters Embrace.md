Winter's Embrace

In winter's chill, the world turns white,  
With frost that sparkles, pure and bright.  
Each flake a whisper, soft and true,  
Nature wrapped in a blanket due.
  
Silent nights beneath the moon,  
Stars ignite, a frozen tune.  
In every breath, a frosty sigh,  
A moment caught, as days drift by.


- Halfred Lee
