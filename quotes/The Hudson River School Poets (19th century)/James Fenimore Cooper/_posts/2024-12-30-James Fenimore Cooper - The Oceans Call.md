The ocean waves crashing,
   On the rocks down below,
With a hand that is gentle,
   And a heart full of woe.

Here the salt air is bracing,
   Here the spirits are free,
And I find in each tempest
   A new life given to me.

Let me stand on the shoreline,
   With the sky wide and clear,
For the power of Nature
   Is forever near.

- James Fenimore Cooper
