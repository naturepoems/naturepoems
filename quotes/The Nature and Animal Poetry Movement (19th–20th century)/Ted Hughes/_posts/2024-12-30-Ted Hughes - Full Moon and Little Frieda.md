Full Moon and Little Frieda

The Full Moon and Little Frieda,
My daughter on a live night,
Drained in the quiet stretch of sky, fractured pearl—
Outside, a chorus hums, to the clingy light in her eyes.
Time flows, honey-bright, as earth draws me and her, tangled
In laughter and secrets where a world unfolds,
That outer state of nature—balancing between grasp,
Yet fearless as the moon above,
Sets back over our sights, wide and bright.

With your blushes under darkened pools above,
How you inspire wildness beneath a cloistered prickle,
An ember of stars, twinklers bright as sunlight,
You and the night, light meets darkness where we pluck 
Fractured dreams—a glimpse of harmony—
Unknotted by the patterns of life.

Until the brightness dims across the distant hill,
I reach and clasp the child brought forth,
Winged with the stillness of memory—a balm, a feast,
Our hearts turning to chase the night together.


- Ted Hughes
