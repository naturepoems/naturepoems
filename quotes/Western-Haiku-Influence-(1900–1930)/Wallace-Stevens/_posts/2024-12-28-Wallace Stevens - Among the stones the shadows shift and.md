quote: "Among the stones, the shadows shift and dance.
The wind, a quiet whisper in the grace, 
Brushes carefully through the low pine, 
Each needle braced against the breath of dusk, 
Here where the white clouds touch the green earth."

Among the stones, the shadows shift and dance.
The wind, a quiet whisper in the grace, 
Brushes carefully through the low pine, 
Each needle braced against the breath of dusk, 
Here where the white clouds touch the green earth.
