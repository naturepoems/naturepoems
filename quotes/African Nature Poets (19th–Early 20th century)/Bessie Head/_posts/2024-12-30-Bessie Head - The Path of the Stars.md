THE PATH OF THE STARS  
Once, I wandered through shadows,  
Underneath the tall trees,  
Until the light broke through  
The canopy,  
Painting the path with whispers.  

Every step marked  
With the stories of time,  
Leading me to the stars  
That beckoned above,  
A promise of brighter tomorrows.  


- Bessie Head
