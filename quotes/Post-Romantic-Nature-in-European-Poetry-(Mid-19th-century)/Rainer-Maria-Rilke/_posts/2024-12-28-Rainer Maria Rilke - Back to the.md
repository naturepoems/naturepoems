Back to the Trees

Return to the verdant embrace,
To where the breath of life begins,
And let the bark feel your heart's beatâ€”
The pulse of being, ancient and true.

In the rustle of leaves, hear the song,
Of roots entwined in the darkened earth,
For within this sacred circle, we find
The echoes of life ringing evermore.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
