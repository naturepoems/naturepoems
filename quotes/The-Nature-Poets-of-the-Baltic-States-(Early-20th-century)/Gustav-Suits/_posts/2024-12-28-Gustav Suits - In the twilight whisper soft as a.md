In the twilight whisper, soft as a sigh,
the forest blushes under the fading sky.
With fingers of gold, the sun bids goodbye,
and crickets begin their melodic reply.

Beneath the broad oaks, where shadows entwine,
the roots drink deep from the earthâ€™s ancient wine.
Petals drop gently, a moment divine,
as the world quiets down, the wildflowers shine.
