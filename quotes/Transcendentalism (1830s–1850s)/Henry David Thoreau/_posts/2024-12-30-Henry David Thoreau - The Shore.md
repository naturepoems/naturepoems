The Shore

When waves come bright and bright,
The evening looks with patience chairs,
As ‘twixt the mountains stand,
    When ocean meets heat in time,
Then trembling reaches far and wide,
Where love's caress brings thoughts unbound,
The shore's embrace leads onward and some say,
          And each one will delight!
But we are brought to wander away—
With heartless love, so look
    Up and down the trains and find
How every feather shall remove.

—Henry David Thoreau
