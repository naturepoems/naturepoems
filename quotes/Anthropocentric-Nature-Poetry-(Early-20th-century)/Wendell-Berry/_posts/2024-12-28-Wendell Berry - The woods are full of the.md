The woods are full of the voices
   of the young and old.
A single of bird, a rustling
   in the underbrush tells me
   that there is life everywhere,
   unseen but always present.

   The air is sweet with damp earth,
   the ferns unfold like dreams,
   and the shy deer move gently
   through the shadows,
   a miracle of existence,
   a grace we often forget.

   So I walk softly,
   aware of my own smallness,
   the vastness of nature before me,
   and in my heart I carry
   the essential truth:
   I am connected to all things,
   a thread in this rich tapestry.


- Wendell Berry
