Snow

The thick snow is on the ground,
   The hidden trees are all but found.
The air is cold, and silence creeps,
   Where light a dream and darkness sleeps.

A stillness broods above the land,
   And whispers of the frost stand grand.
No need of song, for nature stays,
   In deep delight of winter days.

- Edward Thomas
