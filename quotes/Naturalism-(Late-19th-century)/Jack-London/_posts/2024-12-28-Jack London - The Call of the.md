The Call of the Wild

Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong of body and wild of spirit.

Because men, vainglorious men, had heard the court calls of the Klondike, and the law of the Yukon was going to call them into the wilderness, reigniting with fire every spark of the spirit of wolf, long held down by the bonds of civilization, and the Yukon was going to burn with the flames of life and freedom once more.
