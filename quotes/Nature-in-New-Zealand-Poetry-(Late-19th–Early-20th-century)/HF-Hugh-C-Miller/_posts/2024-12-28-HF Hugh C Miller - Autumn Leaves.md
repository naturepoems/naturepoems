Autumn Leaves  
Beneath the ancient orchard trees,  
Where in the stillness, whispers tease,  
The golden leaves fall one by one,  
As twilight comes, the day is done.  

Each leaf a memory, soft and bright,  
A tale of summer's golden light;  
In every rustling, grace we find,  
The beauty left by nature's hand.
