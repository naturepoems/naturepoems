The Wild Common

O wild common under the sky!
Where the wind walks to and fro;
And the daisies and the green boughs lie,
And the larks fly up and go.
Where the grass grows clouded and free,
And the bees hum out of the thyme;
I have lingered here in the sun with thee 
For the twinkle of a happy rhyme.

But where is the mountain of fun,  
Where the swallows go to rest?
Where is the merriment run,
Whose voices grew out of the west?

O wild common under the sky!
The wind walks restless and free;
But the lark is gone! Where can he fly  
Out of the dim void of me?
