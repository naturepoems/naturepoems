As nature unfolds like a gentle note,
The blooms of a thousand thoughts erupt, 
A tapestry woven in the whispers of spring,
Where every petal speaks of birth and beauty."

O world, full of memories and dreams,
As nature unfolds like a gentle note,
The blooms of a thousand thoughts erupt, 
A tapestry woven in the whispers of spring,
Where every petal speaks of birth and beauty.
