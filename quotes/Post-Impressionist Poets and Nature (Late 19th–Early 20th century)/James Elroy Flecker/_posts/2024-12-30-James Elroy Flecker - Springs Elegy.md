Spring's Elegy

To the boughs of spring, I raise my song, 
In tender hues where hearts belong; 
Each petal bursts in softest light, 
Where every knell calls forth the night.

And in the valleys, quick and bright, 
The world is bathed in pure delight; 
The fragrant hints of nature’s bloom, 
Embrace the heart and cast the gloom.

So gently brush away the dust, 
And in this space, find life and trust; 
For spring shall bring the fragrant morn, 
A garland woven from the thorn.

- James Elroy Flecker
