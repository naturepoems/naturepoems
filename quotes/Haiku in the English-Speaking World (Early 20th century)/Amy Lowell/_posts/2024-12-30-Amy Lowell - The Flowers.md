The Flowers

Close you eyes,  
And feel the soft petals fall  
Against your cheeksâ€”  
Each blossom is a kiss that lingers,  
And the sweet perfume rises  
Gently from their lips.  

You can tend to the flowers,  
And bring your secrets there,  
In this fragrant world  
Where chaos and order blend,
In every fresh scent that the wind carries  
To the dancing joy of the forgotten skies.

- Amy Lowell
