A bird, came down the walk —
He did not know I saw —
He bit an angle-worm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw.

And then he drank a dew
From a convenient grass —
And then hopped sidewise to the wall
And added to the mass —

So, I can think of this, and that —
But, as for life on other scales —
Who cares? This, now — is all, and all —
And why would I care — others tales?

- Emily Dickinson
