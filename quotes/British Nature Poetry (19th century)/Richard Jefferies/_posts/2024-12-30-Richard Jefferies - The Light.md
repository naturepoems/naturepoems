The Light
Upon the hills, the morning light

Breaks forth with grace, a wondrous sight,

Transforming all with hues so bright,

Dispelling every shade of night.

In natureâ€™s hand, the colors play,

Each ray a brush, each gleam a day,

For in the light, we find our song,

A dance with nature, sweet and strong.

- Richard Jefferies
