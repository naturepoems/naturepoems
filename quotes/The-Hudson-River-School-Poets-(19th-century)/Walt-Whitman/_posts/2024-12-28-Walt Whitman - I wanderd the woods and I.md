I wander’d the woods, and I gather’d,
Fresh violets of gentle birth;
Peering low, in the cool embrace,
Of the green, beneath the wide blue earth.

In every petal, there lies a story,
In every blush, a silent joy,
In the streams of a babbling brook,
And the heart of a wild, pure boy.

For I have journeyed through the flowers,
And basked beneath the golden sun;
In each leaf and each precious drop of dew,
In each whisper of wind, my spirit runs.

— From "Leaves of Grass"

- Walt Whitman
