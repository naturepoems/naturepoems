The Earth

Upon this earth of ours,  
Where shadows come to play,  
With emeralds glittering in  
The heart of this great clay,  
The pulse that blossoms wide,  
Beckons our weary gaze.

Life weaves upon this canvas,  
With colors bold and sheer,  
Merging time’s long echoes,  
In verdant symmetry unclear—  
Yet as true as love remains  
In every shiver, thrill, and tear.

— D.H. Lawrence
