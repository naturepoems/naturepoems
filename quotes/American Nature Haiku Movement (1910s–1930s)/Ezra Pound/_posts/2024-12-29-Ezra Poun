After the vigil,
The night draws a shiver smooth;
You will meet me in dreams,
Shorn edges of a darkened room—faintly...
Rivers of sleep, underneath folded eyelids’ drops, 
Push the minutes with talons,
To catch the day’s last rays,
And beckon the fingers of twilight,
Winking lights brimming, 
Chasing the evenings before they turn cold.

- Ezra Pound
