The Tomb

The oil of twilight fills the sky,
As the night pulls the veil of dreams,
The heart-seed holds fast in the dark.
Upward the shade can only absorb
The quiet music of wings—
Amid the shadows, the flickering leaves,
Of the sun’s gentle whispers.

Beneath the fold of roots, under frost,
The earth holds hidden stories,
In the garden of space we wander,
Seeking life amid the passing evening songs.

— H.D. (Hilda Doolittle)
