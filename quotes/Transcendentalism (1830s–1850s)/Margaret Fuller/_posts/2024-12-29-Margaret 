Oh mighty oak, with branches wide,
You cradle dreams in your layered side,
Through seasons’ change and storms’ fierce fight,
You stand your ground, a beacon of light.

With roots entrenched deep in the ground,
You whisper secrets of life unbound,
Your leaves will flutter in grace and song,
As we find in you where we belong.

- Margaret Fuller
