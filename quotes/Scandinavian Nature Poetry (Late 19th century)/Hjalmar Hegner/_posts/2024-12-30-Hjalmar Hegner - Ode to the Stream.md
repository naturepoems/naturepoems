Ode to the gentle stream that winds,  
Through meadows bright where daisies bloom,  
You sing a song that soothes my mind,  
In nature’s presence, grief finds room.

Your waters clear as crystal glass,  
Reflect the clouds, the trees above,  
In silent peace, I’ll let time pass,  
For here I find my heart, my love.

- Hjalmar Hegner
