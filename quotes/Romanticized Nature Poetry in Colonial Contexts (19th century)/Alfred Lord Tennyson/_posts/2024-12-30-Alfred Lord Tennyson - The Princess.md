The Princess
Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;
   Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk;
Nor winks the goldfinch in the porphyry track;
   Nor is there singing in the wildness
While the earth sleeps alight in spice and meads.

With drooping branches, point to love:
   For here may come wet rain, a smoky night;
And if the morn of flowers unlucky shrouds,
   Placing the petals still upon the boughs.

I wander through this night-mad festival,
   And in my dreams I hear what naught remains;
I seek the dark’s good, fashion’s fair degrees,
   And the sweetness lingers on the breath of roses.

Nor breath nor wind will stir the silent night;
   Yet, when I bow, the petals fall, and sigh;
And deep the jays within the dark will climb
   As rests the night on wings of prophecy.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
