Oh, let me linger, let me stay,
In fields of gold, on summer's day,
Where flowers bloom and spirits sing,
And life's sweet essence takes to wing.
I find my peace, my heart's delight,
In the soft embrace of warm twilight,
For nature's breath is where I roam,
In its embrace, I find my home.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
