Each and All

I

The lordly Moose more than a beast,
Each creature in this vale serves men,
Each flower doth perfume their feast,
Each beetle ’neath the buds sends forth
His thundering proces in life again.

II

Doth not beauty, distant far,
In the sapphire of this cup sparkle?
A lark that darts for the sunless bar,
Resounding boldly for the wise?—
Grateful they hold that vanished marvel.

III

Song bids failings in mistaken hearts.
Doth not melody shape the soul that can scream?
This reverie that finds at last in parts
Life—whose things wander full of light like dreams.

IV

For such as ye, my friends, this spark,
These shining thoughts the fields grow use,
That nature’s art is everywhere so stark,
Yet in visits of beauty’s forms so offers more

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
