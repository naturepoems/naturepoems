An Octopus

Its motion is all energy, rapid and coruscating,
chasing a whirlpool up, below, dark in the sea.
Now, exhausted in searching, the moonlight bathes
the undersurface of green and blue waves,
while tentacles reach everywhere,
capable beyond patterns of skin,
error entwined in flesh.
It is life, this stretched suspension,
it remains wild. Do not fret, it loses form in water;
it is untamed, becoming more unfathomable,
a language surely disjoint.
Be assured, when heavy rain upon the ocean flattens the
noisy dust, 
its promise is in sights, not praise, nor jealousy,
just beauty, a wildness in nature, pulling close.



- Marianne Moore
