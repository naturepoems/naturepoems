The Flight of the Brown Wren

By Sidney Lanier

I
Over the sea and the fertile vale
       Where the valleys of bluebirds flow;
From a kernal of light in the blossoming boughs,
       The wren swoops by in a fluttering show.

II
I can follow her sweet little tune,
      And with joy to my heart I wend;  
For where thereâ€™s a flutter of brown-wren there,
      My spirit would oft take the friend.

- Sidney Lanier
