Through valleys deep and gardens fair,
From morning dew, to twilight's glow,
I walk where all the world does care,
In every seed, in winds that blow.

The bramble-tangled trails I seek,
Lead onward to the hills so steep,
And in their paths, both wild and meek,
The magic of the earth I keep.


- F W Harvey
