I go to the woods to lose my mind,
And in that wilderness,
A revelatory calm—
Where my senses bloom
Like wildflowers in spring,
Letting the sunlight filter
Through leaves of green,
Casting shadows that dance,
To the rhythm of the wind.
Here I am found,  
Not lost, but made whole,
A part of the natural world,
The harmony, o so sweet.

- Henry David Thoreau
