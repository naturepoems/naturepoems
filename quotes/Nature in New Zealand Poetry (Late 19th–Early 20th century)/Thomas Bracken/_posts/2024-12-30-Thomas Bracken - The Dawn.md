THE DAWN

Awake! The dawn is breaking anew,
With light spilling gently o’er valleys and hills;
The sun yawns broadly, the sky dons its blue,
While the world stirs slowly, the morning heart thrills.

The songbirds flit in jubilant flight,
As the dew-kissed petals begin to unfold;
Nature awakens, embraced by the light,
In a joy that each life’s moment can hold.

Let us wander together in the fresh morning glow,
With laughter as rich as the nectar so sweet;
For each dawn brings promise, for us to bestow,
The magic of living, of life's wondrous feat.

So rise with the sun, dear friend, take my hand,
Let us greet the new day, full of love and of grace;
For in Nature's embrace, we'll forever stand,
Where each precious moment is time’s tender trace.

- Thomas Bracken
