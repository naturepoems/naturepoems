Autumn Song

Golden leaves dance down the path,
In swirling patterns, bright and clear,
They sing a song of fleeting days,
A melody that lingers near.

As shadows stretch and daylight wanes,
The beauty fades as all things must,
Yet in this quiet, tranquil dusk,
Lies treasuring the earth's soft trust.


- Anna Akhmatova
