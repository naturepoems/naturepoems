There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
In the strength of the mountains, the roar of the sea;
There is a music in the running brooks,
That sings to the spirit; that calls to me.

A joy that is pure with the dawn's fresh light,
In the beauty of nature, I feel the grace;
Where the heart finds refuge, the soul takes flight,
In the wild, in the free, I discover my place.


- Matthew Arnold
