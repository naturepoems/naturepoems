Let me wander where the wild  
May find a heart that’s still a child.  
Among the trees, the hills, the streams,  
Where all of life is born of dreams.  

In every leaf, a story told,  
Of love and life, of bold and bold.  
I’ll seek the heart of nature’s creed,  
In whispered language, I will heed.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
