The Nectar of Life

Oh, if I could bite a pear,
And thou would come at my request—
Then I would eat it for my share,
And sit with thee, my sweetest guest,
And drink the very nectar there.

Let the sun kiss our faces warm,
Let the wind dance ‘round our feet,
And the earth give us her charm—
We, two, together, to sit and greet,
Among the flowers, safe from harm.

- Robert Herrick
