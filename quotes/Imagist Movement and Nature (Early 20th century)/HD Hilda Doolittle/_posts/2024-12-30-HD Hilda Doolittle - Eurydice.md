Eurydice

    O draw not away,
    you might desire
    to kiss me,
I who have sat
    in the daylight
of flowers,
    by violet balls
and the daisiesâ€™ shadows
    softly glow,
        out of their petals.

Take me not
    to the dark trees
    those pass
    with their shadows,
but let me remain
        in the light of the day.

- HD Hilda Doolittle
