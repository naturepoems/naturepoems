Where windswept hills meet endless sea,
The waves can whisper into glee.
Nature’s song unfolds and swirls,
In seagrass tides, a vision twirls.
        
The salt-kissed air ignites the soul,
Reminding all of time’s true goal.
Against the waves, we stand so free,
In harmony with earth and sea.
        
Let echoes call, let laughter ring,
For nature's heart shall ever sing.
In every grain, a truth is found,
In timeless rhythms, our souls are bound.

- Philip Larkin
