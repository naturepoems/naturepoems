In the interest of truth

The only remedy,
for that wretched feeling
as others speak,
delivered by Nature
a healing dose;
wild daisy,
given as common sense.
Riches and ideals,
spirit light with vivacity,
open up like a flower,
blossoming in blackness,
revealing its purity,
its core, softly humming;
flowers flourish in space,
though our sighs rise.

â€”Marianne Moore
