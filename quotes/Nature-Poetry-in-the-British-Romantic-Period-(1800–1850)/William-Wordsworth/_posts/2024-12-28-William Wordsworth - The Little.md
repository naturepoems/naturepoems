The Little Flower
I wandered lonely in the glade—  
A little flower, bare and bright—  
Its petals kissed by evening shade—  
Brought to my heart, pure joy and light. 

I knelt to touch its velvet cheeks,  
And found in act of tenderness,  
The courage that a flower speaks,  
In moments calm—a gentle grace.

- William Wordsworth
