The Call of the Ocean

The ocean calls out softly,
A lullaby on the shore,
Its waves lap against the sands,
In a rhythmic, endless roar.

Each tide brings tales of voyages,
Of sailors bold and brave,
Whispers of the mysteries,
That the deep blue holds and saves.

Oh, to linger by the water,
Where the sky and sea embrace,
In the call of the ocean,
Life finds its sacred space.

- Ossie Mthembu
