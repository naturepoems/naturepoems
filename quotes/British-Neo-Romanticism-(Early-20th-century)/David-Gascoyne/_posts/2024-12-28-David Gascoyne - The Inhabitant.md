The Inhabitant  
In the empty woods,  
Where the shadows hover,  
I stretch from the aching sky  
To the earth beneath my feet,  
And I am alone,  
An inhabitant of dreams.  

The trees weep past my shoulders,  
Their branches entangling  
Like lost hopes,  
But the earth sings below meâ€”  
Acorns fall like tears,  
Filling this silence  
With fruits of forgotten prayers.  

Above, the clouds drift slowly,  
As old memories  
Carried on the wind,  
And in the spaces between,  
The promise of wildflowers  
Whispers of birth and rebirth.

- David Gascoyne
