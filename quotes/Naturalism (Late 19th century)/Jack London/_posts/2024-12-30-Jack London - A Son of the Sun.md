A Son of the Sun

I am a son of the sun and a daughter of the sea, 
With the pulse of stormy weather coursing through me, 
I dance with the spray, I embrace the sand, 
I live as nature intended, fierce and grand. 

Among the waves I claim my right, 
To live beneath the bright-shining night, 
To blend and swirl in the ocean’s breath, 
To feel the ecstasy, the art of death. 

For life is both storm and gentle grace, 
In the sun’s warm kiss, in nature's embrace, 
I am reminded through every tide, 
That I am wild; I am alive.

- Jack London
