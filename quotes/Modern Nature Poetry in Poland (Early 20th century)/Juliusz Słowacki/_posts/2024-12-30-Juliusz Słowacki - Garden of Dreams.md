Beneath the stars, a garden grows,
Where love and nature intertwine, flows.
In every bloom, a story's told,
Of dreams pursued and hearts of gold.

The gentle sigh of the evening breeze,
Carries whispers among the trees.
Nature's choir sings in unison,
A melody where the soul has won.

In every petal, every seed,
Lies a promise of hope, a sacred creed.
In this symphony of life and birth,
I find my peace, my place on earth.


- Juliusz Słowacki
