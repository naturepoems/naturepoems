The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver

Son, I know, in the next world wait
For whom I cannot wait,
And the hope you think while you are great,
Waits the blessing late.

A child, a mad, sweet child,
With the beautiful autumn leaves,  
Will speak of me—of the child
That the autumn weaves.

Beneath the summer sun,
My heart is keenly keen,
But time so doth take
That I year's quite unseen.

Yet in the bark or nut or stalk
Of a tree, a song will lie,
And that song will die,
With my leaves that sigh.
