In the forest, deep and dark,  
The trees are thick as thoughts of winter.
They whisper truths that nature gave.
You must wander, soul at steady purpose,
In the woods, the heart will be the slayer.

Deep down where light and darkness play,
Here time stands still, the air is pure;
For every step you take will lead you,
To the hidden path of being wholly free.


- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
