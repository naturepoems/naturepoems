Lines from ‘Coney Island of the Mind’
The sun is coming down
like an indifferent god
and the blue sky opens up
into something soft
like laughter in the breeze.

Here in the city of dreams
there are oceans of concrete
that break against the rocks
of shadowed alleyways
and bright days filled with color,
walking upon the solid ground
where life is a mirage,
we are just wanderers of tomorrow.


- Lawrence Ferlinghetti
