There is no time like Spring,
  When life’s alive in everything,
Before new thinking blooms,
  Before the world’s delight,
And all the clouds are fled; 

The blackbirds sing their boldest song,
  And lucent starlings eat the dead,
The trees are clad in clover,
  Let the breeze arise again.

But never mind their fears;
  What a wonderful start for us,
And how the moon grows bolder
  When the stars come twinkling down.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
