The Morning

The sun’s bright gaze from yonder peak,
A radiant gem this quite unique,
Born to kiss the waking earth —
And blind the flowers, revive their worth.

A solemn hymn the birds shall sing,
To greet the morn and all it brings,
From dew-kissed lawn and vibrant field,
In song of joy they kneel, they yield.

My heart, too, feels the morning’s breath,
Each moment born shall conquer death,
Each ray of light to guide my way —
Nature’s unveilings greet my day!

- Rudyard Kipling
