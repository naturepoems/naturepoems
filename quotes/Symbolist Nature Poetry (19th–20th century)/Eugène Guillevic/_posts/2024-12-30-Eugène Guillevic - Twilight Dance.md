As the twilight beckons,
    shadows gather softly,
   tangled in the quiet,
   curling around the stones.

Rivers sing with fervor,
   their tones float on air,
   crisp notes layered, curling
   like a smoke of dreams,
   winding towards the stars.

Beneath the glimmering,
   walks the heartbeat of night,
   the cradle of silver sighs,
   swathed in twilight's embrace,
   illuminating feathers of dusk.

In this, we behold,
   life’s cypher – a moment,
   soft as velvet,
   yet brimming with light.

With each passing breeze,
   we exist, we know.
   This is not darkness,
   only the deepening hue.

- Eugène Guillevic
