Echoes in the Valley
In the valleys deep, where silence reigns,
Echoes of nature sing heartfelt refrains.
The mountains stand guard, a fortress of stone,
In their shadow, I wander, never alone.

Each breeze carries whispers of the past,
Footsteps of ancients, in shadows cast.
In this sacred embrace, I’ve come to discover,
Nature’s true essence, a spirit to uncover.

- Alexei Kruchyonykh
