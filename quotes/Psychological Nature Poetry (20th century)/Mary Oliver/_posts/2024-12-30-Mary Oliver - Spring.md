Spring

The moon was full last night  
and hopped around  
a little bit,  
but now it is all  
back to moon,  
a sweetness in the puddles  
that hasn’t faded yet.  
How could I have thought  
of the moon as  
a solitary visitor in the sky?  
Instead, I now see  
everything  
that is beautiful, sweet,  
appears in vast rooms  
of my childhood, giving way  
to spring’s best offerings,  
birds singing,  
green leaves falling,  
a butterfly appearing  
in the full ambrosia of the heart  
as it flutters by.

- Mary Oliver
