The Timeless Sea

The ocean breathes, a rhythmic sigh,
Its waves a dance where spirits fly,
In salty air, we taste the free,
The endless whispers of the sea.

From shores of sand to depths unknown,
In nautical dreams, our hearts have flown,
The sea of life, both fierce and fair,
In every tide, we find our care.


- Franklin P Adams
