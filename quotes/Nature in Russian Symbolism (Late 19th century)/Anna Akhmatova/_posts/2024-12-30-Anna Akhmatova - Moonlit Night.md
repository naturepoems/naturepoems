The moonlit night, a quiet serenade,
Illuminates the world in silver hue,
Awakening the thoughts that lie in wait,
That speak of love, of sorrow, and of you.

The stars, like scattered dreams, twinkle high,
As shadows play upon the forest floor,
I wander through the dark with an open heart,
Listening to nature's tender, whispered lore.


- Anna Akhmatova
