Clyde Valley

In the heart of Clyde, where the rivers intertwine,  
The valleys cradle secrets, where wildflowers entwine,  
With echoes of laughter and whispers of dreams,  
In the embrace of the mountains, the spirit redeems.

Beneath the willow's weep, we find solace and peace,  
As the water flows gently, our troubles release,  
The earth cradles us softly, with warmth in its hand,  
In the heart of Clyde Valley, we honor the land.

Oh, let us remember the treasures we hold,  
In nature’s arms, the stories unfold,  
For in every petal and every stream's flow,  
Is the magic of life, forever aglow.

- P E J M Taylor
