When morning dew on petals lies,
And sunbeams dance in twilight skies;
A world unfolds in simple grace,
In every corner, we find a place.

To walk through gardens lush and bright,
Is to witness life and light;
In every bloom, each fragrant breath,
We find the pulse of life, not death.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
