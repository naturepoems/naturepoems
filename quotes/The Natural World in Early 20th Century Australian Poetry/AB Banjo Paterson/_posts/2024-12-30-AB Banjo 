From the hills of the hinterland, the call shall arise,
To the wild riverbanks, where the green pastures lay,
And the spirit of freedom will dance in the skies,
As the echoes of nature entice us to stay.

With the whisp’ring willows that cradle the streams,
And the laughter of children, the song of the dove,
Through the colors of day and the magic of dreams,
We’ll cherish our moments, this beauty, our love.

So stay with me under this radiant sun,
Where the vastness of life plays its beautiful part,
For the love of the earth, and the heart of the run,
Are intertwined ever in the pulse of my heart.

- AB Banjo Paterson
