The Walls

  Great, swell, like water,
      burnished among clouds,
    forged under order,
  their breathless reach,
     pulses still to me where
       stars wrestle dusk
          and throng
   open the door,
      of the aquatic coil—
  our marriage becomes a circle,
    vast as dreams.
   —H.D.
