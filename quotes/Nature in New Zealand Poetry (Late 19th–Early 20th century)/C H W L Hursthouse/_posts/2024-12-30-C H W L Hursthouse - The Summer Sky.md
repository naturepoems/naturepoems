The Summer Sky

Oh, summer sky, with azure bright,
You cradle dreams in whispered light.
A canvas stretched for all to see,
In hues of hope and harmony.

The golden sun, a gracious muse,
In every day, new paths to choose.
With every cloud that drifts on high,
The world unfolds, and so do I.

So lift your gaze and breathe in deep,
The beauty here, our spirits leap.
For in the summer’s warm embrace,
Life dances forth with gentle grace.
