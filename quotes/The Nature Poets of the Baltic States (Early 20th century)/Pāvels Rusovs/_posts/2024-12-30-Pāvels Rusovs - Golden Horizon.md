Bathed in the golden hour,
Where sky and earth entwine,
The horizon blurs in beauty,
As light spills over the land,
Draping everything in wonder.

The heart feels the pulse of nature,
In the sway of every flower,
And in the silence of mountains,
The dreams of the earth linger,
Whispering tales of eternal love.
