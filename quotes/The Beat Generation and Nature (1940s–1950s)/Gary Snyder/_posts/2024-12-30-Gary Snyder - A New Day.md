A New Day
A new day rises,
each dawn a different story,
each sun touching colors,
a canvas painted bright,
each shadow casts anew.

A new day, let it stir,
as moons grow old in cycles,
remind us gentle, slow,
of what it means to be,
to stand rooted in the earth,
to sing among the trees,
it brings us closer home.

— Gary Snyder
