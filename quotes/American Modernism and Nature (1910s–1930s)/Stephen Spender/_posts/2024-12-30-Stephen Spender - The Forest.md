The Forest

In the heart of the forest I find my peace,
Where the whispers of leaves echo my own,
Each shadow a retreat, a moment to breathe—
I listen as the wood thrush calls me home,
To the stillness wrapped in ancient redwoods,
And in their presence, I lose my worries,
For nature unfolds in its profound embrace,
Where time is a gentle stream, flowing free.
