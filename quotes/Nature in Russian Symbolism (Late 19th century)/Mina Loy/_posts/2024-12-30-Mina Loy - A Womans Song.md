A Woman’s Song
Where the gust peels back,
the autumn’s bitter toll is gained.
Smoke wisps intricate as lack,
fire-warmth in trees count this toss,
like breath — birdsong lingers,
in the coolness of gathered belongings,
where twilight is the preface,
for wildness to both envelop the moon,
and carry night up step-like pastures,
whiskered of dreams and colors ripe,
a woman raises softly,
harmony before her to dance the woods.


- Mina Loy
