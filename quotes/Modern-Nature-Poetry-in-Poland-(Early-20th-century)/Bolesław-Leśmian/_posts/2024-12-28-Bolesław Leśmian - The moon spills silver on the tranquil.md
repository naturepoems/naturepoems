The moon spills silver on the tranquil pond,
And swans glide like whispers across the way,
Where wild flowers live and sweet gravestones stand,
In the tender embrace of the night and day.

Amidst the sighing forest, the owl hoots,
Each note wrapped in whispers of dreams unmet,
And the world turns soft, like the tender roots,
Entwining with secrets of shadows unmet.


- Bolesław Leśmian
