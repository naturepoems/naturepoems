The Moon and the Stars
The moon casts her silver lace,
  And the stars shine bright,
As I wander through the night,
  Seeking the path of grace.

The trees whisper secrets,
  In a language of their own,
And the rivers gently hum,
  Melodies of the unknown.

Oh, to be lost in the wonder,
  In the night's sweet embrace,
For beneath the moon and stars,
  I've found my sacred place.

- Langston Hughes
