The Silent Land

Oh, deep within the silent land,
    Where time is but a breath,
Iâ€™ve wandered forth to understand
    The secrets held by death.

For in each shadow, dark and bright,
    A thousand stories lie;
And in the heart of bitter night,
    The dawn is waiting nigh.

- John Shaw Neilson
