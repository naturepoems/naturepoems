To the Fairies

I’m on the bridge that shakes,
Where petals lift and no feet fall,
With the light twisting storm.

Below in the nights,
Where moon shadows roam,
You come, nudge my brow,

And I am your child here,
Built up on bones,
Wrapped in clouds as do not leave me, imploring.

Oh, embrace, little spark,
For I tremble in your wake,
And the world spins on, sublime and pure.

- Gwendolyn Brooks
