Midsummer’s Night

A midsummer’s night, soft and sweet,
The air heavy with the scent of flowers,
As fireflies flit like stars summoned down,
Painting the garden pathways with light,
Where shadow and laughter intertwine.

Underneath the ancient oak, lovers’ sighs,
Mingle with the rustling leaves,
A serenade of crickets sings lullabies,
As dreams take flight on moonbeams,
And youth, vibrant as the summer sky.


- George Mackay Brown
