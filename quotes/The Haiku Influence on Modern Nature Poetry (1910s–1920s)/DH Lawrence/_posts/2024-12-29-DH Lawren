The Sky
The sky, so vast, so wide,
Is the blanket under which we dream;
Its colors shift like whispering tides,
With fiery reds, and day’s gentle cream.
Beneath its gaze, our souls take flight,
In the wonder of every dawn and dusk,
In the embrace of the stars that shine,
We find our place in the cosmic husk.

- DH Lawrence
