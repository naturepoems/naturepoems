In the Woods

The trees stood tall, their shadows long, 
Embracing the silence in natureâ€™s song, 
Where dreams were spun in whispers of leaves, 
And the gentle heart of the wild believes. 

Each step, a hymn to the earth beneath, 
Where the moss cradles secrets in softness, and sheath, 
A realm of enchantment, a breath of the breeze, 
Kindling the senses, putting the heart at ease. 

With a rustle, a call, the forest awakes, 
Awash in the wonders that each moment makes, 
For life in the woods, with each pulse and each sigh, 
Holds the promise of wild in the boundless sky.

- Jack London
