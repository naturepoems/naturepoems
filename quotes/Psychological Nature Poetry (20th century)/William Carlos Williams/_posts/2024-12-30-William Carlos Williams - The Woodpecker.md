The Woodpecker

Your hard-beaked  
hummingbird  

drum  

is maimed;  

your quest's no less.  

But always the heart  

drives forward  

beyond the wood.  

And even by  
the leaves  

of time, your  
tip  

has fled, the blue  

in the sky  

comes from the secret  

light.

Only then you are  
near  

this edge  

when your music ends.

- William Carlos Williams
