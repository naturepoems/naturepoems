When daisies pied, and violets blue,
And lady-smocks all silver-white,
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
Do paint the meadows with delight,

The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he,
"Cuckoo!"
O word of fear, unpleasing to a married ear.

When shepherds pipe on oaten straws,
And merry larks are plenteous in the sky,
When turtles tread, and rooks and daws,
And so am I, and so am I!

Am I!  Am I!  O boy me!  O shall I fly!
For my love is not yet gathered at her best.
My heart will fly then I shall die in the green rest!

- Robert Herrick
