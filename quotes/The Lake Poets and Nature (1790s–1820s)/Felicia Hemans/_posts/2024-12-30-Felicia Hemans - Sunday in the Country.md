Sunday in the Country

The sunbeams in the glade,
Shed their effulgent ray,
While through the leaves they played,
And made the shadows gay.

The spirit of the morn,
Rests sweetly on the flowers,
While bright the dew-drops adorn,
Amazed by the spring’s sweet hours.

Here peace within us waits,
Our cares will disappear,
For Nature’s open gates,
Breathe life with every cheer.

Let hope its treasures yield,
In the garden rich and new;
Our heart shall be revealed,
By every sunlit view.

—Felicia Hemans
