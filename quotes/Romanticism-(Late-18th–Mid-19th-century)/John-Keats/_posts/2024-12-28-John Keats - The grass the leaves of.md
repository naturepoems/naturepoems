The grass, the leaves of trees,
The flowers that up-turn their happy faces,
When the sun slips from behind a cloud,
And a soft whisper runs through the air;
All are parts of nature's cheer.

But how shall I praise the streams,
That shout with joy as they glide,
Among the rocks and mossy banks,
Where the gentle breezes dance,
And nature holds her lovely sway?

The bird that sings at dawn,
A tiny note as sweet as the dew,
Brings light into the stillness,
With a blessing for us to view,
A melody of blissful tune.

O how nature fills our hearts,
With beauty's canvas, ever so bright!
Let us cherish each tender rose,
And hug the trees with pure delight,
For the joy of nature’s love is our right.

   — "The Grass" (Excerpt)
