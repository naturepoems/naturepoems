Lover's Leap

Upon the cliff where lovers stood,
The view of valleys vast and wide;
A moment shared, a sacred wood
Where heart and spirit freely glide.

The wind carried their laughter bright,
As stars awoke to greet the night;
In nature’s arms, they found their place,
A cherished bond, a sweet embrace.

- Marjorie Pickthall
