Nature's Music
In the heart of the forest so deep and so wide,
The squirrels and birds are my only friends,
Where the brook doth sing and the flowers abide,
And where nature her music never ends.
The rustle of leaves in a soft summer air,
The chattering of creatures that flit to and fro,
The hum of the bees fills my heart with such care,
And the beauty of wild things fills my soul with a glow.
