In the forest’s heart where the sun sleeps at noon,  
The whispers of branches kiss softly like a tune;  
Each shadow a secret, each rustle a sigh,  
In this sacred domain, I can’t help but cry.  

The creek babbles sweetly, a child of the glen,  
It sings to the stones, to the trees, once again,  
Every ripple, a memory, every drop, a dream,  
In this cathedral of Nature, all things are redeemed.  

Let me weave with the ferns, let me dance with the dew,  
In this realm of enchantment where all life feels new;  
For here I discover that time has no sway,  
A timeless, pure moment, in the woods where I stay.

- Marcel Proust
