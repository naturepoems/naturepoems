Ash-Wednesday

Because I could not stop for Death –
He kindly stopped for me –  
The Carriage held but just Ourselves –  
And Immortality.

We slowly drove –  He knew no haste  –  
And I had put away  
My labor and my leisure too,  
For His Civility –  

We passed the School, where Children strove  –  
At Recess – in the Ring –  
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –  
We passed the Setting Sun –  

Or rather – He passed Us –  
The Dews drew quivering and Chill –  
For only Gossamer, my Gown –  
My Tippet – only Tulle –  

We paused before a House that seemed  –  
A Swelling of the Ground –  
The Roof was scarcely visible –  
The Cornice – in the Ground –  

Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet  –  
Feels shorter than the Day  –  
I first surmised the Horses' Heads  –  
Were toward Eternity –  


- TS Eliot
