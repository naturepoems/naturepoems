THE EXCHANGE

Take me to thee, heart, nor can be farewell;
    We might not part until thee claim embrace.
And though I might fright days out, till all that’s known,
    Still let me come to pass bare in embraces,—

Then, as thou dost know all men all mine honour; love,—
    Yet love will die, and flares become an ill breeze,
But here I do plead — so old and well it can tell:
    Until the kindness give, thy love returns their peace.

Then all, but true love's breath still falls on mine name;
    All pray now shall I never aim to part.
As life then at dawn’s kind rest, let forty years fair here,
    I knew all this long; this is not mine heart.

- John Donne
