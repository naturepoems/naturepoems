Morning Song

The trees stand like lovers,  
Flushed and excited  
With the blush of dawn;  
And I listen to their song,  
Rising like a breath of life into my spirit.

The morning steals quietly,  
Waking the flowers to revelation,  
Each petal unfolds softly,  
Caressed by the sun,  
Reaching toward the day with eager hands.

I taste the sweetness in the air  
And realize this moment  
Is all that leads to infinity—
Where the earth breathes together  
With my own heart,  
In the song that has no end.


- Robert Bly
