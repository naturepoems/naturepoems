The Seasons
With every shifting season's grace,
The colors dance, the time we trace,
In the spring, a bud’s delight,
In summer's glow, a heart takes flight.

Autumn leaves of gold and brown,
Whisper memories, gently drown,
While winter’s gaze in quiet keeps,
Holds the world in peaceful sleeps.

Nature weaves her tale so fine,
In the fabric of the divine,
Each season brings its own sweet song,
In the circle where we all belong.

- Joyce Kilmer
