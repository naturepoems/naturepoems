The rain is here, thinning the light.
The butterfly floats through the shadows; 
A lilac writhes in bright handfuls.
Blue shadows lie on the path.
The early stars repeat the glow, 
A fox glides out in the grass,
The moon is wide in a smother of cloud. 

In the morning, with no hunger,
Only my eyes are open.

- Richard Aldington
