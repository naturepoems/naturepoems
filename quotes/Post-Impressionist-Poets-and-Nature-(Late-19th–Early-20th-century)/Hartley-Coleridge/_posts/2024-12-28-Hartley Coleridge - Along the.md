Along the Brook
Along the brook, where waters glide,
And whisper sweetly through the glade;
In nature’s arms, where dreams abide,
A symphony of joy displayed.
The wildflowers dance in pure delight,
While sunlight plays on rippling streams;
A tranquil spot in morning light,
Where nature lulls us into dreams.

- Hartley Coleridge
