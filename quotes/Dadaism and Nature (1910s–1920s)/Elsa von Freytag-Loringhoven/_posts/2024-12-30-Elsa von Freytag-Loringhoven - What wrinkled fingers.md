What wrinkled fingers!
   Sweeping thistles’ morning,
   the blades of grasping truth.
   We harvest stars,
   with raised brows,
   celestial hands.
   Dashing, hastening,
   the eyes of wind
   spin
   their stories, lobbed
   amazed against the reeds.
   O sky, do ye bear
   each luminescent hue?

- Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven
