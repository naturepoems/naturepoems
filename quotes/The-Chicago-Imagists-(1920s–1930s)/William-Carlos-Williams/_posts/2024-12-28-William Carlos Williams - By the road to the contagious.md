By the road to the contagious hospital
Under the surge of the sky
— a white plumed building, 

My heart is in deft repose, 
And the elms are sombre

All that time has gone by,
The sky is heavy with leaves.

And in that heavy air
I think the sun

Dares brush me aside –
The grass stands radiant,

I stand uncomforted –
My flesh alive to the present

Is the game of the season.


- William Carlos Williams
