Spring Pools
These pools that, though in forests, mean
No better than the oceans' isles,
When I have walked in where there no ground
I find it it too heavy to drown:

Where swayed reeds and lilies sweep
The hazel tree without a sound
And feathered things that dip and sweep,
And every tide can cast a mind.

And now no spring can lose its strength,
No dream, no time can say, I can
Because some few old thoughts of worth
Still bang their heads in every heart.

And when I finish every line,
All of things which hold the same kiss,
Then I descend into the brinks
Of common pools who never learn.

- Robert Frost
