Beside a garden full of shade,
Mid sunken walls with moss o’ergrown,
On plushest meadow grass, I laid
My weary head and mused alone.

The deep saloons of shady boughs,
With golden blossoms throughed the air,
Where sunbeams shine at idle hours,
In perfume threw soft light on me there.

For violets drank the clouded beam,
With every breath that swept that place,
And sweet hibiscus bloomed with dreams,
Enticing my heart with their calm grace.

Soft breezes gathered, kite-tail’d near,
Whispering like happy children’s prayers,
In echoing laughter did they steer,
Sounding in sans fining with cheer.
— Lament for Iago

- John Keats
