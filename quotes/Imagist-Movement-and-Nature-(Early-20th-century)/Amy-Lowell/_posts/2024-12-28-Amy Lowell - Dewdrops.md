Dewdrops cling,
To the tender grass,
Like jewels murmuring,
With the light of dawn,
In every droplet, a world,
Reflected in stillness,
Building a moment,
Where nature breathes,
And whispers soft secrets.

Breeze twines through,
Silken petals,
Gently swaying,
In response to the love,
Of the sun,
Creating a dance,
Of beauty and life,
In the radiant morning.

â€” Amy Lowell
