Spring

The breath of spring fills all the air,
With blossoms bright and scents so sweet,
The tender blooms, the softest light,
A fragrance that my heart shall greet.

In meadows where the daisies sway,
I hear the song of life return,
A symphony of hope and joy,
In every petal, love shall burn.


- Anna Akhmatova
