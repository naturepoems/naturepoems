Away from the throng, my heart roams free,
Through valleys green and mountains tall,
In every tree, I find a key,
That unlocks nature’s hidden call.

There’s wisdom in the wild’s embrace,
In every bird’s unhindered flight,
As I dissolve into her grace,
I take my place beneath the light.

- Henry David Thoreau
