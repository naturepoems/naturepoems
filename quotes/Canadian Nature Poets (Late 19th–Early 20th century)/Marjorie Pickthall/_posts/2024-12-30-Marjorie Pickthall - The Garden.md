The Garden

In the garden where the wildflowers grow,
Bright petals dance in gentle breeze;
The setting sun's golden glow
Whispers secrets through the trees.

Among the blossoms, time stands still,
A haven from the rush of life;
In every bloom, the heart can fill
With nature's beauty, free from strife.

- Marjorie Pickthall
