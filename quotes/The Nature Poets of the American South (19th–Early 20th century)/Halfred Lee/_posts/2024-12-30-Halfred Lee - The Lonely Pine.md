The Lonely Pine

On a hill, a lonely pine,  
Stands alone, a silhouette fine.  
Its branches stretch to touch the skies,  
Solitude sings in whispered sighs.
  
Through storms it bends but does not break,  
In stillness found for its own sake.  
Nature’s strength, in quiet grace,  
In every breeze, it finds its place.


- Halfred Lee
