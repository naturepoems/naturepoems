To a Wealthy Man Who Promised a Second Subscription to the Dublin Literary Fund
You whose great office is to give
A great oneâ€™s bounty to love so much
That all should read and something receive,
With childish joy, I wish to touch.

And here, from the opulence of time,
An olive branch, a flower, its scent of wine,
And pearls of many a tranquil sea,
Shall scent meets men of high and low degree.

- William Butler Yeats
