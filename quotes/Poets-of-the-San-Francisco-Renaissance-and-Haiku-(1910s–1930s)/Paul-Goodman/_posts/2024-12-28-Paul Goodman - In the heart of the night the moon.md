quote: "In the heart of the night, the moon softly gleams,
Casting shadows on dreams and whispered themes,
The nightingale sings to the stars up high,
A serenade to the darkness, a lullaby."

In the heart of the night, the moon softly gleams,
Casting shadows on dreams and whispered themes,
The nightingale sings to the stars up high,
A serenade to the darkness, a lullaby.
