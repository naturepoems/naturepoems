To sit in the shade, while the soft summer air
Sighs through the leaves, and whispers in song,
Is an ancient delight of the soul that's aware
Of the beauty of life that’s flown all along.

In the pale twilight, days wrap their ease,
A flicker of sunshine in every grind,
And soft-shining dreams dance upon the trees,
As the world carries on with its burdens, blind.

- George Gordon Lord Byron
