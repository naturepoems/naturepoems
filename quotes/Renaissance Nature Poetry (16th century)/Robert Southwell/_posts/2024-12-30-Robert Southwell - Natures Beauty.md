The earthly thought of the thankless mind,
Is blinded with the brilliant light,
As in a trace of things that do bide.
Our souls find joy to be entwined.
This is the meaning of our day,
Where birds do sing and breezes sway.
so sweet is life where nature reigns
And all her bounty gives no pains.

- Robert Southwell
