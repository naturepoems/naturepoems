MY GARDEN

I.
In a corner where stillness reigns,
I sow my seeds in the barren ground,
For the beauty of blossoms that shall remain,
Is like love’s sweet whisper all around.

II.
With pruning shears in a gentle sweep,
I tidy the earth with patient skill,
For why shall I mourn or fall to sleep,
Where nature’s magic lingers still?

III.
So here in the heart of my little plot,
Each petal of hope and fragile leaf,
In colors our hearts have long forgot,
Speak of the times and alleviate grief.

IV.
As seasons pass with whispers low,
May blooms of all colors glisten bright,
For a garden, though humble, allows us to grow,
In nature’s embrace, where all feels right.

- John Gibson Lockhart
