Morning Poem

Every morning I walk like this  through the world,  and I notice how  the trees are standing, the birds are singing,  how the evening passes into night,  and I think God is here,  and that no matter how hard I try  to make it work  it’s as ungraspable as these moments,  and the whole world is just as beautiful  as it seems to be.
I can’t quite hold it,  I can’t quite make everything perfect,  but I remember  as I walk  that presence is a gift  and that together we are enough.

- Mary Oliver
