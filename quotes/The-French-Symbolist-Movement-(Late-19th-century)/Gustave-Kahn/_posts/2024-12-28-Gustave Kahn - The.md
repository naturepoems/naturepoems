The Meadow

A soft expanse of verdant hue,
Where wildflowers sway, dance, and play,
The sun kisses every petal anew,
In the warmth of a perfect day.

Butterflies drift on gossamer wings,
Tracing paths in the fragrant air,
In this haven where joy sings,
And natureâ€™s love is laid bare.

- Gustave Kahn
