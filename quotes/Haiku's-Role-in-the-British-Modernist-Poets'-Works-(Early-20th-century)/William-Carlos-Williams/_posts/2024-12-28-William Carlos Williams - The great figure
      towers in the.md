quote: "The great figure
      towers in the air,
It is the prevailing
      earth beneath it
That tells you—
      Oiny, Oiny,
We have not passed away
      as we must, being
The half-way, neither here
      for that it matters."

The great figure
      towers in the air,
It is the prevailing
      earth beneath it
That tells you—
      Oiny, Oiny,
We have not passed away
      as we must, being
The half-way, neither here
      for that it matters.

- William Carlos Williams
