Oceans speak in waves—
Crashing with furious might,
Then recede like a heartbeat.
In the foam and salt, 
Whispers of the deep arise,
A language of the sea.

Stars looked down,
Reflecting in the waters,
As dreams of sailors lingered,
Their souls adrift, / 
In a vast tapestry of blue,
Woven with the night’s embrace.


- Louise Bogan
