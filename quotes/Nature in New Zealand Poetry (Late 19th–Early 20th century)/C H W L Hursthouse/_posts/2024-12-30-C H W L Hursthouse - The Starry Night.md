The Starry Night

When night descends and silence reigns,
The stars appear like scattered grains.
A cosmic quilt of dreams and light,
Filling the void of inky night.

Each twinkle tells of days long gone,
Of ancient tales and journeys drawn.
And as I gaze into the skies,
I feel the truth beyond the lies.

So let your heart be free to roam,
Among the stars, you find your home.
In every sparkle, every hue,
The universe sings just for you.
