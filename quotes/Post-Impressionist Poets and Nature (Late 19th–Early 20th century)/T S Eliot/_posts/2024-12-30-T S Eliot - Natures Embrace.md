In a world where shadows and sunlight entwine,  
   Nature's embrace grants solace divine.  
   Each pebble and flower, each glisten of dew,  
   Holds echoes of wisdom, forever in view.
   
   As the seasons shift, with their delicate grace,  
   Time paints the landscape, altering space.  
   Here in this moment, we savor what's real,  
   The beauty of nature, a solemn appeal.

- T S Eliot
