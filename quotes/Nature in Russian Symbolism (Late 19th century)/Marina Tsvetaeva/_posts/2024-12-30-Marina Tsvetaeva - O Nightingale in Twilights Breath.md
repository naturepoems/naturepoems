Oh nightingale, in twilight’s breath,
You sing the songs of dusk and dawn,
With every note, my heart takes flight,
In fields where shadows softly fawn.
The moonlight crowns the silent trees,
While whispers linger in the air,
Each sigh a testament of love,
Nature’s voice, a soft despair.
And so I wander in your tune,
A tapestry of light and shade,
Revealing truths of nature's hand,
In the symphony you’ve made.

- Marina Tsvetaeva
