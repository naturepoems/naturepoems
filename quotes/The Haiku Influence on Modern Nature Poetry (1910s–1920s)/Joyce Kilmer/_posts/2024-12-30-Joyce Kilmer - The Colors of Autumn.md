The colors bright of autumn’s aim  
Paint through the misty skies;  
Each note of joy or shade of pain  
Reflects in nature’s eyes.  

The rustling leaves, in swirls of wind,  
Carry the love of days;  
Their falling soft, the colors pinned  
Give beauty to life’s ways.  

So let the seasons shift and roll  
In time’s eternal flight;  
Reflecting in the heart can toll  
A signal of delight.

- Joyce Kilmer
