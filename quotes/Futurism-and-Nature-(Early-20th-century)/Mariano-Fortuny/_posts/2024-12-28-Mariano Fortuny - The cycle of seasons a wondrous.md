The cycle of seasons, a wondrous sight,
From the blooms of spring to winter's white.
Each moment a painting, vibrant and bright,
In nature's gallery, hearts take flight.

The twilight paints the horizon's edge,
A tapestry woven on the evening's ledge.
In this stillness, find a sacred ground,
Where the essence of life in stillness is found.

- Mariano Fortuny
