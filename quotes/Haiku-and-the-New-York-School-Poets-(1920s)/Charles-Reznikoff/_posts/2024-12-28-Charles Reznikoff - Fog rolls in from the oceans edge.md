quote: "Fog rolls in from the ocean's edge,  
  soft and veiled,  
cocooning everything  
in a gentle hush,  
it mutes the sounds,  
a secret shared with the night."

Fog rolls in from the ocean's edge,  
  soft and veiled,  
cocooning everything  
in a gentle hush,  
it mutes the sounds,  
a secret shared with the night.

- Charles Reznikoff
