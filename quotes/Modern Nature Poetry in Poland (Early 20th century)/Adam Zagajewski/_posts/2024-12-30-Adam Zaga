The Morning after the Rain

Clouds recede slowly,
a cautious wave retreating,
revealing the ground's soft pleasure.

Drips hang from the branches,
like unwritten words,
a potential to tell great stories,
yet filled with humbleness.

The air feels different,
a tangible embrace,
a fresh beginning,
a picture newly drawn, inviting.

The flowers bow as if to honor,
those moments been forgotten,
a breeze holding back laughter.

And around the corner, I see it,
a figure, like a hymn, rising,
filled with courage, peace,
a new dawn reflecting natureâ€™s voice.

- Adam Zagajewski
