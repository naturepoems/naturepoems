Scented Herbage

O scented herbage of the fields,
The laughter and delight of an afternoon,
Embrace me, as I wander in your blessed bower,
Where the honey bees whisper dreams upon the breeze.

You are Truth in the softness of your petals,
Life in the depth of your roots,
I am lost and yet found in you,
Forever sewing the fabric of existence together.


- Walt Whitman
