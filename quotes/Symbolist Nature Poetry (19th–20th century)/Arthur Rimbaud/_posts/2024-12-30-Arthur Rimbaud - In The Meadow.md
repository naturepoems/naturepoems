In the meadow where thoughts have strayed,
Between the flowers pink, and wild ones laid,
Softly whispers engage, and silence sings,
Underneath the shade, of leafy wings.
The paths that wind, they gather hope,
Petals and buds in a serene slope.
Mellow fronds sway, as the winds begin,
Nature beckons sweetly with a grin.

- Arthur Rimbaud
