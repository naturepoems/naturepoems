In the Days When the World Was Wide

In the days when the world was wide,
And the time was free and gay,
They'll give my love the story beside,
Of the paths that I stray'd and lost along the way.

For we wandered by the green brook;
And we took each flower and shade
With the simple joys that each undertook,
For the world was young, and spirits never afraid.

We danced 'neath the branches where the sun was nigh,
And drank the dew from blossoms bright –
For the power of the morning’s sigh
Went to all who smiled that day’s delight.

There were glimpses, secrets shared, so true;
As we sought such peace, under the skies,
For the days were alive and every heart flew,
In the laughter and love of hopeful sighs.

So take me back to the story written when
In the land of the young, my heart did play,
Just to dream and breathe where the whispers began,
In the days when the world was wide and gay.

- Banjo Paterson
