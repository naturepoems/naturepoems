The Spirit of the Wild  
 
In the wild where silence reigns,  
Where nature’s heart and freedom gains;  
The spirit dances, fierce yet free,  
In every branch and every tree.  

Amongst the leaves, where shadows play,  
I find my thoughts and dreams astray;  
Embraced by all, the wild, the free,  
I touch the stars, I am, I see.

- William Henry Channing
