In the depths of winter,
when silence reigns,
the world transforms,
wrapped in white.

Snow becomes a blanket,
a moment of peace,
a muffled stillness
that calms the heart.

And under the cold
the earth waits,
sorting through dreams
until warmth returns
and whispers; then life
will stir once more.

- Ted Berrigan
