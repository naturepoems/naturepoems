In the damp earth,
a treasure lies,
a seedling cracks,
a fragile promise,
a quiet rebellion against
the silence of the winter.

Nature stirs, wakes,
a riot of colors exploding,
each petal a shout of life
against the backdrop of gray.
The soul breathes,
a communion with the sun,
a Dadaist applause,
a moment of truth emerges.

Birdsong breaks,
a spontaneous serenade,
while the breeze dips low,
twirling to the tune
of soft murmurs,
a sacred symphony,
a melody lost in time.

What joys remain
in this thriving network,
a wild dance of existence,
a web of interconnections,
where the earth speaks,
every time it rains.

Let me be here,
in the arms of nature,
cradled in the hum of color,
a witness to wonder,
a child at play,
wrapped in the absurdity
of being alive.

- Alice Toklas
