Where the river windeth,
   At the foot of yonder hill,
A stream like a silver ribbon
   Danceth bright and shrill.

Here the sunbeams linger,
   Here the shadows play,
Perpetual peace and beauty
   Mark the quiet day.

Here the heavens mirror
   In the waters deep,
And the murmuring breezes
   Sing me to my sleep.

- James Fenimore Cooper
