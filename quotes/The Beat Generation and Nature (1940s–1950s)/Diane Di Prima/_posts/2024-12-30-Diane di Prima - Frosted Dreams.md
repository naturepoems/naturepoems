Frosted Dreams

The world lies quiet,
cradled in frost,
as the morning awakens,
each blade of grass wrapped
in a crystalline hug,
until the sun kisses it awake,

in the chime of laughter,
the whisper of beauty,
nature's soft touch reverberates,
each breath a part of it.

Here in this space,
a dream opens its eyes,
and pushes the edge of winter
into the arms of spring,
breathing new life into
our shared stories,

we are the voices,
the songs sung in the hush,
every moment a shared embrace,
a fleeting glance of what is,
reminders of the warmth,
woven through time,
carried forward,
into the wild.
