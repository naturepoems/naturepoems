Farewell to Florida

Goodbye to the pine trees and sand,
The stir of the sea, the warmth of sun.
As waters rise, they brush the shore’s rampage,
And life shifts about beneath the waves,
Yet still, the beauty emerges from within.

For here the light may dazzle us new,
As storm clouds tease, developing delight.
A part of me remains, forever drawn,  
For in nature’s hold is rhythm spun,  
In every heartbeat, like a song anew.


- Wallace Stevens
