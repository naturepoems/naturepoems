Ocean Song

Oh, the roar of the raging sea!
Where the waves crash upon the shore,
Each tide, a lover's return,
Each spray, a kiss of salt and mist.

Seagulls wheel overhead,
Slicing the endless blue,
Calling out to the world beneath,
In the language of the wild.

The horizon shimmers,
Where the water meets the sky,
A vast canvas of dreams,
Painted with hues of azure.

Here I stand, a grain of sand,
Among the great and timeless,
Listening to the ocean's heart,
A song of eternity echoing in my soul.

- John Thompson
