Autumn Leaves

As the trees shed their garments,
The forest wears a crown of fire,
Each leaf a gem of amber and gold,
Whispers of summer's farewell.

The crisp air carries laughter,
Of children gathering treasures,
As the sun dips low, whispering,
Goodnight to the cooling earth.

The scent of woodsmoke drifts,
Through the velvet dusk,
Where shadows dance with the moon,
And the stars begin to wake.

In this moment of change,
I see the beauty of endings,
For in the fall, life is reborn,
In the hush of a winter's sleep.

- John Thompson
