The Rhodora

In the late spring  
With the veils of the pastel world  
Woven into your softness;  
You present as mere nosegays  
To the too proud and perfumed dahlia.  
In dusk I hear the breathless silence.

But how arresting your petals—  
A thousand crimson arms of beauty  
Hold aloft the echoes of joy,
While the wind curbs its madness  
Simply to pause before you.  
Dare we speak of the hues themselves
And the lessons that lay like petals?  
What could be more enchanting,  
They are lost in the grave stillness  
Of various beings remembered in you.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
