The sky ablaze with hues of fire,
As day gives way to night's desires;
In every glimmer, every shade,
A moment captured, and displayed.

Amidst the twilight, shadows play,
In nature's magic, we find our way;
In the dusk's embrace, stillness reigns,
And in our hearts, forever gains.

- Vladimir Solovyov
