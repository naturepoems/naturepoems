I have lain under
the dark places
among the turning tides,
an echo of silence
that covers the forest floor. 

Each breath of the leaves,
each breeze carries
the whispers of ancient
premises waiting
to arise,
waiting to free
that which anchors
in the depths of roots. 

But see,
each flower claims
a right to scent,
a deity casting perfume,
each wing soars through,
a hymn of the wilderness.
Hark, do you hear it,
at the edge
a glimmer begins,
where the heart takes flight?
