Though the morning light is soft,
   And melts with its lustrous palm,
I feel a kiss settle over the earth’s song,
   In silence deepening softly.

Life wakes to the approach of dawn,
   The trees seem to awaken the sun,
   While dull storms drift, and expand, and bloom.
— *To Some Ladies*

- John Keats
