Sparrows

How infinite are the sparrows!
Little paler in reclamation
as they nestle between walls,
clinging to a golden sign;
bound by color, warmth inflecting,
yonder comes snow, gentle, yet down,
a moment where color lifts—
this light travel I capture,
glancing within each wheel of thought
among the cobbled echoes of
cloud-to-cloud, sparkled fragments
a portent that lets me await.

In the silence ‘twixt closure and mercy,
as autumn rustbacks shape,
I know them scattered by wind,
friends stretch till halves return,
a feathered echo above tree,
and once stood beside me.
Birds are lost in every courting line,
caress and fill each sky, exquisite notes,
a bend toward patience.
Even pinched birches heat towards joy—
I notice sparrows blend “together”—
yes a glimpse at rippling stems,
boundless warmth, breathing companions,
yonder across a patterned floor;

- Marianne Moore
