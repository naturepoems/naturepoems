Waves
The sea roars with passion,
a rhythm of undulating depths,
each wave a breath, a heartbeat,
playful splashes on the shore.
The sun dances on the surface,
glistening diamonds in its wake.
I am but a grain of sand,
witness to this endless struggle
between the water and the land,
two lovers forever intertwined.


- Julian Tuwim
