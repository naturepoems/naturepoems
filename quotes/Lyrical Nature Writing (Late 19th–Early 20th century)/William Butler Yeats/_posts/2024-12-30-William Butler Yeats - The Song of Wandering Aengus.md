The Song of Wandering Aengus
I went out to the hazel wood,
Because a fire was in my head,
And I cut and peeled a hazel wand,
And I went to the brooks side,
And I found a little silver trout,
And I caught it, and it turned into a beautiful woman.

With a tangled golden hair;
And I thought I would never see her again,
But I will go, and when I see the cocccord,
I will love her forevermore.

- William Butler Yeats
