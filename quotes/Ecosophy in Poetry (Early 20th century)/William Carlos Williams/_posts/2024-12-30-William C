The Widow

To the waves,
so clear the stars will define,
the icefalls of many dreams.
As the aches
press on, we see thee above
as you move through it like shoes,
andeled horns of gold.
Shall I shoulder the strength of night,
yea shining over—through cheeks
of light! The fire sickness mid-morning.
Come one; so sly—the glow bathed
in your light as we board
the wonderful sun—
  so far out of hand concrete
shall not smash up the stones, shall it?
How gently surrounds her; the chill:
smoothly hovering the fast slabs
of books you laid near—FYI I’ve read!

- William Carlos Williams
