The Gathering

In that shade held together,  
Each fall breathes life again  
Among the branches.  
I could see within the thicket,  
Where the gathering thrummed alive,  
Fingers explored soft surfaces  
Caressing the light of dawn.

Reflections in the cool air  
Drew us closer;  
In the simple act of being,  
I learned the language of the trees—  
Comfort lying in their arms  
Like a river sweeping us forth  
To embrace the growing chorus—
An answer beneath the bark,  
Rising from the earth's core.

- Robert Hayden
