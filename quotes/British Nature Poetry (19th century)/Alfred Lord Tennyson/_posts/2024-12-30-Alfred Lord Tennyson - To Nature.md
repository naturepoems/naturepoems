To Nature

O Nature, thou art my own!
   For all thy voices breathe for me,
And all the world is sweet as the moan
   Of Spring, that stirs the willow
   And weaves the drops in silver flow.
My heart is lost beneath thy spell,
   For thou art half my soul ever,
And whosoever keeps thee deep within,
   Shall know the dearest warmth of love.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
