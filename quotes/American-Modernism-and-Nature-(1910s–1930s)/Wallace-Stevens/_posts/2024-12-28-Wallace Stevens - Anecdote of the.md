Anecdote of the Jar
I placed a jar in Tennessee,
And round it went upon a hill.
It made the slovenly wilderness
Surround that hill.

The wilderness rose up to it,
And sprawled around, no longer wild.
The jar was round upon the ground
And tall and of a port in air.

It took dominion everywhere.
The jar was white, stout, and tall.
When placed in it, it made a path
Of waves, where trees and hills,

- Wallace Stevens
