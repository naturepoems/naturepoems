A Walk in the Meadow  
 
With each step in fields of green,  
Where every wildflower is seen,  
The earth holds stories yet untold,  
Of adventures shy and bold.  

Beneath the vast and endless sky,  
The lark sings sweetly, soaring high,  
And as the breeze begins to weave,  
I find my heart in nature’s leave.

- William Henry Channing
