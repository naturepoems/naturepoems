Autumn’s Farewell
The leaves are falling in the wood,
Each fluttering note, a last goodbye;
Their colors dance in yellow, gold,
And underfoot, they gently lie.

The balmy air, with hints of chill,
Proclaims the Autumn’s mournful breath,
But beauty clings in every chill,
And lingers on ’til summer’s death.

Now Nature wears a cloak of grace,
In stillness, finds her rich embrace,
Yet every hue I now behold,
Whispers to me of tales untold.

—Charles Tenney Jackson
