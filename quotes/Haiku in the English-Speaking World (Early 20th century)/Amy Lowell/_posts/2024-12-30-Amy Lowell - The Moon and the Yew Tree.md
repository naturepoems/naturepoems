The Moon and the Yew Tree

The yew tree is a cool shadow.
This poem is a little labyrinth,
And it is circular.
I sit and look at the moon.
The moon has a white crown, and it is sitting
On a throne made of stars.
This is the only sphere, it seems, that is not growing old;  
That is the one thing I can depend on.
It has no mouth but the70 light shining from its face
Seeming to make a sound.
It is telling all my secrets to the dark  
But I alone can hear them.

Maybe the shadows are watching me
But they appear only as reflections
Made under the dark water of the night.

- Amy Lowell
