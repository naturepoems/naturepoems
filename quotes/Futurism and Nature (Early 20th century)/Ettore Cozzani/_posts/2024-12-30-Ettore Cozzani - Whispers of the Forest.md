In the silent eaves of the forest,
Under the pallid sun,
Quiet, where shadows play,
I hear the whispers of a breeze,
Like a forgotten melody,
Humming through the leaves,
Each note a memory.

The azure sky stretches,
Endless as time’s embrace.
I wander through the dappled light,
Where earth kisses the air,
And the scent of damp soil
Awakens the essence of life—
Vibrant, pulsating, real.

Here in the depth of solitude,
Nature soothes the restless soul.
Give me more of these sacred moments,
In the intertwining of existence,
A sanctuary where I can grow,
Rooted in the beauty that is ours.

I offer my heart to the wild,
For in every rustle of leaf,
In every flicker of light,
A piece of me finds its place,
And in return,
It blooms with the fragrant joy,
Of intertwined lives.

- Ettore Cozzani
