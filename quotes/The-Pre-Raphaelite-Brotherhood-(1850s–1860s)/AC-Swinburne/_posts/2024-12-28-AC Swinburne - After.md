After Death
The noblest brow that ever science claimed,
And that which had been fairest, purest, best,
Ere yet the breath of life could hallow it,
Takes time, and time is love; once let us pause
To find the poet's hand upon the soul,
To feel the moonlight like a fleeting breath
On the face of life, and hear its haunting hymn
Among the reeds that whisper in the wind.

Oh moon of night, thy heart is as the sea,
The tides of knowledge kiss thy silver sand,
And angels wait to wake thee from the deep,
So that the stars may learn of thy sweet breath
That winds along the meadow's violet threads.
