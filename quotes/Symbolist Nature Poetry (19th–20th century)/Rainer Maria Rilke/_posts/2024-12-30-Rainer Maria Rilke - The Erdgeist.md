The Erdgeist

Oh, how wide, the soul’s embrace,
That finds a corner here in moss,
This pulse of deep fertile earth,
Where Nature unfolds its trust to wander.

The twilight leaves behind a scent,
The secret sighs of roots that kiss
The darkened soil and live in rhythm,
Wooded hearts enshrined in breathless calm.

Here shadows rest, where the spirits linger,
Between the flicker and the trembling leaf;
Each grain of sand, an echo of rare stillness,
As the moments weave their fragile light into the dark.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
