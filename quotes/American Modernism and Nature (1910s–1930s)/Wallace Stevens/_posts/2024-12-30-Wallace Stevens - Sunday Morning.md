Sunday Morning

Death is the mother of beauty; hence from beauty.
This is a poem about the importance of finding beauty
In the natural world, as it is essential to life.
In the quietude of the morning sun,
Lending your ear to the songs of the robin,
The glimmer of dew among the grass,
In this Sunday quiet, nature breathes.



- Wallace Stevens
