The Ocean

The mighty sea, with its endless motion,
Washes away all traces of time;
From shore to shore, in its sacred notion,
It flows with rhythm, a timeless rhyme.

Oh, how it calms the restless soul!
With whispers soft and tempests fierce,
Its waters stretch, without control,
An endless wine-glass for dreams to pierce.

- Clara Barton
