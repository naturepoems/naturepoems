To My Book

  A book! My friend, thatâ€™s a delightful thing;
  With leaves all fresh and faces fair;
  When Nature takes her breath of spring,
  And wakes the blossoms everywhere;

  It cannot speak, yet it can charm,
  With thoughts that dance like dew on flowers;
  When all the world is full of calm,
  It will be with us in the hours.


- John Greenleaf Whittier
