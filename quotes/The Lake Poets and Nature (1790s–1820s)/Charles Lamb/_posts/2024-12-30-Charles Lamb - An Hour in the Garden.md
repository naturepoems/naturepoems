An Hour in the Garden

In stillness, midst the leafy throng,
I find a peace that’s pure and strong;
Where fragrant blooms and shadows twine,
And daydreams in their stillness shine.

A lullaby of whispers sweet,
The flowers dance, their rivals greet,
In every bud, in every leaf,
I feel the joy, I shield my grief.

Let me abide in Nature’s grace,
As time unfurls this fair embrace,
For in the heart of this soft scene,
I find my solace, calm, serene.
