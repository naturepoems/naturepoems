The Hills
The hills are battles of beauty,
Bared to the windsâ€™ embrace,
Where silence profoundly curls,
In valleys in simple, steady pace.
They stand, shadows etched in the skies,
Where the sun and moon share thrones,
A chapel carved from roots and stone,
Perpetual, ageless, alone.



- Julian Grenfell
