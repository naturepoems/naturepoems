Still, the flowers push through the frost,
Though silence reigns, we have not lost.
In every bud, a latent dream,
The world outside can only seem.
        
Past seasons whisper through the green,
In sheltered corners, life unseen.
We hold our breath; await the day,
While nature keeps the dark at bay.
        
Hope’s essence blooms where shadows fade,
In daring hearts, the path is laid.
Among the petals, truth will sing —
In time, the heart will find its spring.

- Philip Larkin
