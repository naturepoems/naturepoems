When the last light fades, and shadows deepen,
The forest breathes its quiet, woven mysteries,
Among mingled roots and knotted trunks,
The night unveils its stars,
Whispering against the dark veil,
That binds hearts to the rhythm of the earth,
In twilight glimmers where thoughts wander free,
Nature, our eternal guide.

- Evelyn Scott
