The Forest

In the green depth of the wide, still wood;  
Where the trees look up with their heads in prayer;  
While the paths are dim with a shadowy mood,  
The melody murmurs alone in the air.

Here the violets breathe their perfume,  
In the shy, cloistered glade, so sweet;  
While the dappled lights with a flick’ring bloom  
Dance about where the wild things meet.


- G L D Mackay
