A Celebration of Charis

Let us enjoy our ease,
  0 Life! ’tis all we have,
To lounge amid the trees,
  Or headlong down the wave.

Her rosy lips like cherries,
  And eyes that shine with glee,
With sylvan maidens merry
  She crowns our jubilee.

   Let us rejoice like today’s
   Spring, and what time follows:
When nature’s gentle ways,
  Shine sweetly through meadows and hollows.


- Ben Jonson
