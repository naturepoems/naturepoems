The Autumn Leaf

When the leaves are turning gold,
And the air is crisp and clear,
A story of the days of old
Flutters down, a whispered sphere.

They dance upon the whispering ground,
These fading jewels of the sky,
In their twirling they are found,
A fleeting grace, a soft goodbye.

- Marjorie Pickthall
