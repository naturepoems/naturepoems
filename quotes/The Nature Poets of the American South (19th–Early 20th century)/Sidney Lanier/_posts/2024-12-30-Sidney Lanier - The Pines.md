The Pines
The pines are girding us about
  With their limber boughs and long green spires;
And they sway and sway in the sun, devout;
  And when the shadowy night retires,
Their solemn voices sing and crowd,
  Beside the river’s wandering flares,
Whispering low, yet deep and loud,
  Their yearning for the sun’s glad cares.

They weave the winds in graceful reels,
  They arch about with a stoic grace,
Worshiping nature where each feels
  The echo of a wild embrace.

- Sidney Lanier
