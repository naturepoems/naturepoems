A Spring Rebirth

When winter’s grip begins to fade,
And life returns in vibrant shade,
The crocus blooms and sunbeams dance,
In nature's grand, poetic romance.

The songs of birds fill every nook,
While bees return to every brook,
A symphony of life anew,
In every petal, every hue.


- Franklin P Adams
