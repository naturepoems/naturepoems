The Crows

The crows sat in the poplars,  
  For the sun’s last light;  
  They turned slowly,  
 
As if waiting for the night —  
  It was something we had.  
  Yet they took no pains,  
 
To croak out their minds,  
  Nor give a shout,  
  They simply shifted  
 
In their dark outlines,  
  and went up front.  
  The heart of a poet—  
 
Has an edge to its  
  fluttering wings  
  Like a crow placed in sound,  
 
That hovers over the ground  
  without any decision.
