The Rising Sun

With each dawn's embrace,
The sun rises anew,
A golden orb of hope,
Spreading warmth across the lands,
Awakening dreams of yesterday.

Clouds blush with the light,
Painting the horizon,
As nature stirs and yawns,
In a dance of awakening,
Celebrating life’s return.

Each ray a promise,
Each moment a gift,
As I stand in wonder,
Before the miracle of creation,
Unveiling in the morn.

- Konstantīns Raudive
