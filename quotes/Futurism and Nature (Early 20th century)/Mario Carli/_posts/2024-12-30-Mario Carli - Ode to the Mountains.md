Ode to the Mountains
Majestic peaks,
Cutting the skyline sharp and clear,
Where the air thins,
And time seems to stand still,
A sanctuary of silence,
The whispers of ancient stone,
Gaze down at the valleys,
Cradled below in verdant arms,
Forever reaching,
Towards the heavens,
An ode to endurance,
Nature's steadfastness,
In storms and sunshine,
The mountains reign,
Silent sentinels,
Of time and change,
Their beauty eternal.


- Mario Carli
