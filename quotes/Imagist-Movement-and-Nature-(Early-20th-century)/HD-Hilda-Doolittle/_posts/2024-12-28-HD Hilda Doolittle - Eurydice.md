Eurydice

   I am a shadow of a shadow:
   the shadow whirled white
   on branches; pale, pale;  
   the petals wheeled;  
   how they gasped, and swooped,
   flung from the trees,
   dashed up to the air;  
   lilies trembled as they dropped.

   I, too, fell away,
   I pruned my dark wings;  
   but it was a wanton  
   time;  
   how did I hear,  
   stir in the shadows

- HD Hilda Doolittle
