Upon a tranquil night I dared to fly,
High above the hush, my spirit soared, 
A silver crescent beckoned from the sky,
And where shadows danced on a brightened hoard.

A weave of moonlight spilled its silver shine,
As fireflies winked in silent hymn and peace,
And there I paused, to claim, all that is mine—
The whispers through the trees, their secrets cease.
— Upon a tranquil night

- John Keats
