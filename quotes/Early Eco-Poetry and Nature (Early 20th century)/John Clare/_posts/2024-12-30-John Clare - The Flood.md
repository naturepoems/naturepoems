The Flood
For the earth is full of the moon's gold,  
Where is its peace? it never can unfold.
The sea it is the jeweller's breath,  
In every pearl lies a secret death.
 
It splashes and plashes where it will,  
And out of the past, fresh floods come still;  
Above it the clouds drift high away,  
And beneath it, the life of the People lay.
 
I will open a winding lay  
Among the reeds where the swallows play,  
To wash the feet of wandering men,  
Who seek their homes to nest again.

- John Clare
