The wind whispers over the field,
Sowing tales from distant lands.
The grasses shimmer, alive with stories,
Each blade a witness, every flower a dream.
Under the grand arch of the sky,
I touch the softness with closed eyes,
And let nature's breath fill my soul,
A communion beyond words, divine.

- Amy Lowell
