The Call of the Ocean
Listen closely to the ocean's roar,
The timeless hymn of waves against the shore,
Where the horizon meets the sky,
And the sunset spills its colors,
A canvas of warmth and fire.
Each wave a secret,
Each tide a whisper,
Of stories untold,
Carried on the backs of gulls,
And borne by the salty breeze,
The ocean calls,
A siren song of freedom,
Promising adventure,
And a dance with the infinite,
In nature's boundless embrace.


- Mario Carli
