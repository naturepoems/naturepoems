The Boughs of the Willow  
O willow boughs that sway and bend,  
Your whispers weave through set of sun,  
Each gentle sway, a lover’s friend,  
A verse of love, while day is done.

With every tear the sky lets fall,  
You cradle dreams in branches long,  
A balm for hearts that hear the call,  
Your calming shade, a line of song.

In shadows deep, the world retreats,  
And nature breathes, exhaling peace,  
Within your arms, each worry beats  
A rhythm slow, a sweet release.

So let me rest beneath your grace,  
O willow, in your love abide,  
For in your beauty’s warm embrace,  
Shall every fear and sorrow hide.

- Richard Crashaw
