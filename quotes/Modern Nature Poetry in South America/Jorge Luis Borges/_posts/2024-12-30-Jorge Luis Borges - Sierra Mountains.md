Sierra Mountains

The sierra sings,
Mountains carved like poetry,
Every peak stands as a verse,
An anthem of solitude and strength.

Time flows like the winding trails,
Leading to horizons unseen,
Where earth kisses the sky
And dreams touch the stars.

In their shadow, I learn
Both fear and freedom,
How every stone tells a tale
Of ages past and future pathways.


- Jorge Luis Borges
