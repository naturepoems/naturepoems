A white cloud floats
on the field of blue,
like a puff of cotton,
soft and bouncing.
The sun kisses the earth,
a lively embrace,
where daisies sway
and butterflies waltz,
making the meadow pulse
with their colors.
This is a moment,
a treasure of joy,
a scene from the heart
of natureâ€™s canvas.

- Corrado Govoni
