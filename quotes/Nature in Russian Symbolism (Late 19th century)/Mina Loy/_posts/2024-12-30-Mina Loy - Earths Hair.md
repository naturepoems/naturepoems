Earth’s Hair
which is it always;
its aim beyond knowing,
as in greater flowering,
where petals lie thick and bright,
scant hide their breath,
time-tender grinning.
Look: the grasses quiver
against feet bound
for summer sleep,
Aingerous waves enclose, impose
in breadth this rumination:
watered clay darkly suggests,
where Valentine heard its sprigging,
or none may like it left, nor speak.

- Mina Loy
