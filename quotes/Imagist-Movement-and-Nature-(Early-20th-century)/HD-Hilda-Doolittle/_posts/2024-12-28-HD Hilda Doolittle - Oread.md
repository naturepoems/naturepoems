Oread

   Whirl up, sea—
   whirl your pointed pines,
   splash your great pines
   on our rocks,  
   hurl your green over us—
   cover us with your pools of fir.
   5
   A blue knotted neck,
   are you angry?
   What are you doing,
   changing your colors,
   changing your grains,
   changing your rest, o sea?
   10
   Private as a sea-star
   12
   And the gnarled pines  
   fall; explode;  
   remain!
