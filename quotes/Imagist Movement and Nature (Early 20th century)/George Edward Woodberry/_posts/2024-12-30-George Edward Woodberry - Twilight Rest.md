When the last lights fade away
And shadows gather in the glade,
Let me rest in peace till day,
Among the flowers loosely laid.

For in the twilight, fleeting flames
Are cloaked in nightâ€™s mysterious sheet,
And dreams in silence call my name,
Where nightingales and starlight meet.

- George Edward Woodberry
