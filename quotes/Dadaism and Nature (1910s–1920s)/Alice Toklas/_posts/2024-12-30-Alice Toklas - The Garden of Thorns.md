Here amongst the thorns,
each petal, a struggle,
a beautiful chaos,
in the garden of life,
a patchwork of color,
a celebration of absurdity,
a Dadaist manifesto written in stems.

Vines twist, entwine,
grasping for sunlight,
while deep below,
roots mingle,
a hidden tale,
a fraternity of kin,
a collaboration with dark,
a promise fulfilled.

In the quiet orchestra,
every rustle is music,
fragile whispers carried,
by the delicate fingers
of the wind,
at the edge of dusk,
a sunset story unfolds,
a saunter into night.

I wander,
a reverie among
wild blooms,
a moment of clarity,
a connection to this,
a reality fabricated
by nature's hand,
wrapping life
in rich layers of joy,
a fractal of existence.

- Alice Toklas
