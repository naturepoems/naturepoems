Glistening

Glistening dew in morning light,
each blade of grass
a tiny world reflecting,
as if every drop contains
the millennia of forests,
each twist of form,
  brings us near,
yet holds the warmth,
  of memory,
a brightness we can touch,
  yet can’t hold—
a world caught between
  nothing but moments.


- Robert Creeley
