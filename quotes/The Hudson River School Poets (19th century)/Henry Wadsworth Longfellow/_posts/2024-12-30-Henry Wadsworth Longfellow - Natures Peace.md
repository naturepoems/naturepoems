Hushed is the sacred strife,  
In the heart of nature's peace,
The clouds tread softly, drifting slow,  
And seas awaken in their order,
The fragrant breath of distant years.

Wherever man may wander far,  
Nature is waiting like a star,
Her open arms, to bear him wholeâ€” 
Beneath the vastness of her soul.


- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
