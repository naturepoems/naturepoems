The ocean whispers sweet and low,
A gentle echo of ebb and flow.
With salty breeze, it calls my name,
Each wave a memory, wild and untame.

Upon the shore, the shells they gleam,
Fragments of a timeless dream;
In each tidal kiss, a story flows,
Of journeys taken where the heart knows.

- Elin Wägner
