I have born the pain and I have born
the scars.
I will say here and now
that people have clasped my hand,
that I have drunk the wine of peace
when all my heart was bleeding.
But who cares?  Who holds the sun?
Who can hold all the stars?

You shall have ships beneath your feet
and the soft sky to cradle you
inside a thousand arms;
And yet you will awaken,
captive yet again,
of music.
And then I see the bird upon the soul,
a chirping body, singing.
A river flows and you fly above itâ€”it is all.

And out there is morning,
that sweet time of honey and light.
And I shall listen to your heartbeat,
for you are my world.

- Carl Sandburg
