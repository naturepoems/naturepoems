Sierra Nights

As twilight descends on the Sierra grand,  
Stars twinkle like jewels, bright in the sky;  
The moon casts her silver across the land,  
While whispers of winds weave a lullaby.

The coolness of night wraps around my soul,  
With silvered shadows playing on high peaks;  
In the hush of the evening, I feel so whole,  
As the heart of the mountains and silence speaks.

Let me linger in majesty, here under night’s dome,  
For time loses meaning, where nature is bright;  
In the embrace of these mountains, I find my true home,  
In Sierra nights’ rapture, my spirit takes flight.
