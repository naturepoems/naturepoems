The Meadow’s Heart
A meadow lies bathed in golden light,
Where daisies flutter in the gentle air,
Each blade of grass a joyful sight,
In this open space, I find my care.

Butterflies dance in a joyful parade,
Among the blooms, life’s simple song,
In the embrace of nature, love’s serenade,
Where the heart belongs, where I feel strong.


- John Rice
