Ode to the Mountains
Oh, lofty giants clad in white,  
your peaks pierce the heavens,  
a symphony sung by the wind,  
a promise of serenity against the blue.

Time twists and bows beneath  
your silent watch,  
draped in ancient tales,  
preserving whispers of storms  
that have long since passed.

I wander in your shadow,  
a pilgrim on paths of stone,  
with every step echoing  
the heartbeats of the earth,  
a song of permanence and change.

- Ruth Padel
