The woods and fields all whisper so,
The lark does wing the air; 
O what delight when he doth flow 
With joy, and none compare!

The river running, running past,
Does laugh beside the tree,  
While every dream that breezes cast—  
Is chocolate all for me.

The shadows dance, the doves do sing,
The sky is blue and bright:
And incantations drift in spring  
That charm my heart with light.
