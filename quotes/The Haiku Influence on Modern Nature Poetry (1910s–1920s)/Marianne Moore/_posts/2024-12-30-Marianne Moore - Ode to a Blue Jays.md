Ode to a Blue Jays

The blueness against hedge and tree—
a brilliance that gathers within itself
like a fault long acknowledged in solace;
my heart rests-;
Eternity’s line opalescent enters...

Their cries call without doubt,
as if even they wonder of wreaths,
wind-spirits each listened. The morning knows.
Here are lines of cerulean harmony,
every branch upon this sky;
we the core softly returned, light grey-green, yet colored,
caress our bright perception of pause still.

Foolishly the worlds prepare,
I speak knowing ruin’s grip could change,
or welcome, while marvelous as seeds to plants,
under each cradled sweet cut,
encounters of shade, a glimmering now.
We grow in ease of light thick hugs,
become even brighter than this.

In hunting, cautious, timid glances,
the connection flows; they were all around us.
daybreak distracts as all judgements fail,
we danced under whispers of passing leaves,
a window opened wide, my thoughts slip back.

Cast each outlook courage; our hope  
boundless and long, what gives off beauty,
all cries upon splitting wings.
I wonder of my thoughts stretched into blue;

- Marianne Moore
