The wind carries whispers sweet,  
in its gentle, playful sway;  
through branches thin, it weaves and meets,  
a dance that bids the heart to play.
\nIt tells of journeys, far and wide,  
of places where the wild things roam;  
it calls us out, where dreams abide,  
a breath of freedom, drawing home.

- John Dewey
