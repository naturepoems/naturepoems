Softly falls the evening dew,
On petals, trembling, soft and fair,
The day bids us a sweet adieu,
As nature sighs a gentle prayer.

In shadows deep, where dreams can roam,
The quiet moments reign supreme,
In every flower, in every home,
Lives natureâ€™s wondrous, tender dream.

- Charles Baudelaire
