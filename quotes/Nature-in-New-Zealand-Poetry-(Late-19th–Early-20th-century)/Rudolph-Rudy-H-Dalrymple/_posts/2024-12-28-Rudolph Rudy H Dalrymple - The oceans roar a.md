The ocean’s roar a symphony,
Of crashing waves upon the shore,
Where seagulls cry and children play,
Nature’s vast stage forevermore.

In twilight’s glow, the sky ignites,
With fiery clouds and fading light,
As stars emerge, their twinkle bright,
A silent oath of peace at night.


- Rudolph Rudy H Dalrymple
