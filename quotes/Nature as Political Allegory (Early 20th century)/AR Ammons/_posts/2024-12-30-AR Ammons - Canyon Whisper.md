The canyon is deep, love,
rocky, profound.
A place where silence humbles,
where the breath of time lingers—
at its edge, I tremble,
each echo reminding me of how

life heaves and falls and reshapes,
often hidden by the veil of ordinary,
yet always giving birth to a new nuance—
I listen, I live,
in this intimate conversation with wind.
