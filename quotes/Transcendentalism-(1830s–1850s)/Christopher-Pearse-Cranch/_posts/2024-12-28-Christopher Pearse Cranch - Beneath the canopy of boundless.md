Beneath the canopy of boundless trees,
Where shadows cast their cool and gentle blend,
I weave the twilit breath that brings me peace,
And linger as the daylight’s colors end.

A quiet stream flows softly through my mind,
Each ripple tells a secret left unasked,
As petals fall and bloom with paths aligned,
The sweet embrace of nature's hands unmasked.

The stars above like memories appear,
Reminding us of life’s celestial play—
Within their hearts are dreams we hold most dear,
As all the world is spun in joy each day.

So let us dwell where secret spirits lead,
In the wild embrace of all we so need.

- Christopher Pearse Cranch
