Butterflies

  The butterflies of summer
  are skeleton in wire, slung
  low to the wind, light their palings
  peer lightly upon fruits, conspiracy
  flitting among garden yields.

  They danceâ€”flaunting on the air,
  tongues colored in breeze fire, they sway
  nigh the nectar of whisper, light upon
  the sun's altar, mothers-to-be cache
  in the unmade wilderness.


- D H Lawrence
