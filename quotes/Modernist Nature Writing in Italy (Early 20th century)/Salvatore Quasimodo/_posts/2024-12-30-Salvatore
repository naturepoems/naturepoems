The Edge of Night

At the edge of night,  
        the sky wears its robe of stars,
        glowing softly,  
        each twinkle a reminder
        of everything that was.

And the earth breathes deep,
        under a blanket of shadows,
        awaiting the dreams  
        to dance in the quiet.

Salvatore Quasimodo
