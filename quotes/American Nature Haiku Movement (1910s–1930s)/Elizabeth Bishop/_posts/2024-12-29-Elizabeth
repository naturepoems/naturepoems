In that night, flowers stretched on walls,
hush whispered back. Time sang, or
thought it once had sung.
Their opening grasp brought colors,
chasing shadows home to roots.
 
Yet, in trembled debris as we stood,
there sauntered mere nature, down below,
under lies or none at all.
The stars dispersed more void than our eyes,
more than echoes new between moments.

And then those endless nights persisted,
as our intentions made, returning,
profound in their place, breathing amok,
offering up a slowly bowing, framed motion—
to nature's gentle manifold.
