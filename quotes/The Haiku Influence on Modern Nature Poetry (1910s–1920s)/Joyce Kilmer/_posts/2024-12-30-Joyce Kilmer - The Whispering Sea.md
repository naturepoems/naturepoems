The winds that blow upon the sea  
Bring whispers to the shore;  
Through drifting sands they call to me  
Of distant lands and more.  

The summer waves, with foam aglow,  
Dance deep with warmth and play;  
To kiss the crags with misty flow  
And scatter dreams away.  

So let me wander in these dreams  
Beyond the emerald crown;  
The gentle tide, with murmurs’ themes,  
Can take my worries down.

- Joyce Kilmer
