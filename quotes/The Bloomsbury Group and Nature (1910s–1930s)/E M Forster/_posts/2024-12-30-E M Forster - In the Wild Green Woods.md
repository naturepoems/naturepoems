In the wild green woods of England,
Where the lazy shadows play,
With the soft breath of the dappled sun,
I long to wander away.

All the world is hushed to listen,
To the whispers of the trees,
As the winds through their branches glisten,
In harmony with the bees.

Let my heart forever wander
In the cradle of the leaves,
In the lush embrace of nature,
Where my spirit truly believes.

- E M Forster
