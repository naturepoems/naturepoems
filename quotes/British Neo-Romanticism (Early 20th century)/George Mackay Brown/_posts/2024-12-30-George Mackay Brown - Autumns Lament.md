Autumn’s Lament

In the swirling dance of falling leaves,
I hear the lament of autumn’s breath,
The crisp scent of decay in the air,
As trees stand bare against the chill,
Their roots clinging to secrets of summer.

Each leaf a memory, fluttering down,
A reminder of what once was bright,
But in the rustle, there’s a promise,
Of renewal in the silent depths,
Where life waits for the warming sun.


- George Mackay Brown
