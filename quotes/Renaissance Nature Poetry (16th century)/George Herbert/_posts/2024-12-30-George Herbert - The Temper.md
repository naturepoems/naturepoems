The Temper  

Grant this great access, my dear Lord,  
That you instead let me divine my painsâ€”  
With dew upon the leaves of every garden found  
For tears he never meant to pour;  
The sun time should rise and enter forth;  
As each leaf shows all is made anew,  
Save from that quick journey known and lost.



- George Herbert
