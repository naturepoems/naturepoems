Silent Noon

Your voice is soft as spring,
And bright the dew as doubt;  
The leaves around me sway and sing  
With unbound sound, and right  
Yet sighing rods divine do doubt   
There in the shaded glow.  
Their bloom  
Is my treasure clanging slowly bowing low;  
In them do kiss and tume,  
And I in music stay without.  

O bright, soft warmth, I call to tas,  
I hold thee as earth lies still;  
Each note and air that sways round hearts  
Are laid upon me, cherished well;  
So do my wandering eye,   
Through half-closed dreams arise,  
From flower to flower sights deny   
Light, laughing in the skies directly.  
But we alone still see  
What down air lightly slides away;  
Speech still shuts back, and to us is clear  
The quiet air and calm is near to stay.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
