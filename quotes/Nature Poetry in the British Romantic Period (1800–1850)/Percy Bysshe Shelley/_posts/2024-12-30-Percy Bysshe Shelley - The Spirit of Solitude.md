The Spirit of Solitude

O lofty Spirit! that dost now behold
The great soul of the infinite; that dost scuba-  
Fish through the stars, the endless oceans yield, 
Wander in the heavens and witness unbound—
Where earths weep their hollowed states, a life we hold; 
O'er the veil—through the silent tracts of air!  

— Percy Bysshe Shelley
