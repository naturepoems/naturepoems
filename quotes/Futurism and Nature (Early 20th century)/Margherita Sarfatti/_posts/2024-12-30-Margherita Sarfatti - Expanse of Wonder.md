Beneath the sky's embrace,
a sanctuary, open wide,
a canvas without bounds,
where each breath is a promise, â€“
a throw of colors, swirling
in the endless palette,
where nature orchestrates
a concert of existence,
the world spins, mysteries unfold,
and in wonder, we stand, waiting.

- Margherita Sarfatti
