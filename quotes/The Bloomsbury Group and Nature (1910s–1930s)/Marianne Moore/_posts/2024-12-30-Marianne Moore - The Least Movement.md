The Least Movement

A sighing nature is soft amid collecting droplets,
A sudden kindred, their leaves cut like limbs,
Fresh as copper pans in the wet mornings  
Whispering health.

And yet this slant of springs timeout,
Many dreams unfold  
Into such pulses  
That tremble riches, vein their claret.

Listen! they come gyrant  
Among the rings till soaked,
Keeping all in warm heaven, day.


- Marianne Moore
