Before the Dawn

Before the dawn breaks,
The world languishes in dreams,
Where time hangs suspended,
A delicate web of shadows.

Each star oversees, a guardian
Of whispered promises unfulfilled,
And soon, the sun will unveil
Mysteries heralded by night.

In this stillness, I ponder
The integrity of natureâ€™s heart,
As the horizon prepares
To cradle a new beginning.


- Jorge Luis Borges
