Bright star! would I were steadfast as thou art—
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night,
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like nature’s own, every symbol bright.

O for a draught of vintage! that hath been
Cool’d a long age in the deep-delved earth,
Tasting of Flora and the country green,
Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!

Aye—let the gaudy day be sweet and fair;—
I’d rather be a forest—in deep sleep
Where Nature’s breath still nestles in its hair,
And every whisper sings its secrets deep.

- George Gordon Lord Byron
