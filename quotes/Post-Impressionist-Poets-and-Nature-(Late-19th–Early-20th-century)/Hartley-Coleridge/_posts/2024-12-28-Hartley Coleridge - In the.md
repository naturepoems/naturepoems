In the Forest
In the forest deep, where silence reigns,
The ancient trees stand proud and tall;
In whispered tones, their wisdom gains,
As nature’s creatures heed the call.
The shadows loom, the sunbeams break,
A sacred space, a world apart;
In every step, our spirits wake,
In the heart of Nature, the soul's true art.

- Hartley Coleridge
