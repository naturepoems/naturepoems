Lying in the Grass at Twilight

In the thick retreating light,
I find warmth in that last embrace,
Lying here with shadows of trees,
That mingle visions,
And the air a-run with grace.

My heart finds home in each whispering breeze,
While tiny wild eyes embrace frail dreams—
And know it is the season flowing,
With colors symphonic blushing
Light-hearted hues of what can't be seen.

- Gwendolyn Brooks
