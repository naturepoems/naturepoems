Forest Harmony

I enter a quiet forest,
a realm of stillness,
where everything holds
its breath,
waiting for me to pass.

The leaves rustle softly,
a gentle harmony,
as if in conversation
with the wind, speaking
the language of life,
understanding the pulse
of each moment.

Step by step, I feel
the grasp of the trees,
the embrace of the earth,
reminding me of my roots,
of what sustains,
of the glory lost
in the rush of it all.
