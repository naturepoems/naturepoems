author: Robert Duncan
quote: "In the quiet of the forest, the air is thick,
With the scent of earth newly kissed by rain,
Each drop a benediction, each leaf a whisper,
As life stirs in the roots and the depths,
Awakening a symphony of burgeoning sounds,
Nature in her glory, resplendent and alive."

In the quiet of the forest, the air is thick,
With the scent of earth newly kissed by rain,
Each drop a benediction, each leaf a whisper,
As life stirs in the roots and the depths,
Awakening a symphony of burgeoning sounds,
Nature in her glory, resplendent and alive.

- Robert Duncan
