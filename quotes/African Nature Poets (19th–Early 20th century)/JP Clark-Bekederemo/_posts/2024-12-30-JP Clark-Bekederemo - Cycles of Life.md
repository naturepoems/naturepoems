In every rustling leaf,
There’s a tale waiting to be told,
Of seasons changing swiftly,
As the earth grows old.

The cycles of belonging,
Are written in the stone,
And nature holds the wisdom,
That we are not alone.

So let the rivers flow,
And let the flowers bloom,
In nature’s vast treasure,
We find our hopes resume.
