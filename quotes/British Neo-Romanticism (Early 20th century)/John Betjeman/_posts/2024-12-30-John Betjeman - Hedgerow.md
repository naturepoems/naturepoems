Where the bramble and the boughs entwine,
And the hedgerow blooms with wild neglect,
There blooms a simple peace divine,
Each blossom hailed with sweet respect.

In summer's warmth, the day expands,
And every leaf, a tale demands,
Unspoken stories touch the skin,
In every breeze, the heart will spin.

- John Betjeman
