A Dream

As morning dew that rests in haste,
Upon the flowers, gone a waste,
Will drink upon the airy floors,
To lighten dreamless, parted oars.
 
The dewdrop’s as light as a feather flown,
That oft we see as brighter sun,
Where every shadow casts a singe,
Will paint anew with spirits fringe.
 
Oh wandering soul in morning light,
Come, come again and bid thy flight!
With every color, song, and glade,
To blossom out, in peace arrayed!


- Leigh Hunt
