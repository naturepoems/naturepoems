Mending Wall
Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,  
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,  
And spills the upper boulders in the sun;  
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.  
The work of hunters is another thing:  
I have come after them and made repair  
Where they have left not one stone on a stone,  
But they would rather make it a play of words;  
I can tell where it is because the fell of it  
Employs a more human dimensional mark;  
I caution how it ought to be fixed.  

Before I built—  
I was very light-headed —  
He tends to say that good fences make good neighbors.  

But the wall of nature cannot fold the field,  
For sure it plays the tension of the light.  
And when I say that too, I must consider it.  

I could think of reaching for the other door  
Just in time to say this more than ever;  
Our shot at letting grass and growth begin;  
While we may riddle every inch of earth back  
Into attention, those who have grown among rest  
Are just the earth to break, their joy is grief;  
All we need to do is love it inside out,  
To take the fences as something alive.
