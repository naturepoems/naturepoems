The Bushman’s Song

Oh, the russet glow of the burning sun,
    The hills in emerald green!
Where the birds are singing and the rivers run,
    Is the fairest place I’ve seen.

But in the depths of the evening hush,
    To a broken tune I sigh;
For the pain it is, that my heart must crush,
    To wander forth and die.

- John Shaw Neilson
