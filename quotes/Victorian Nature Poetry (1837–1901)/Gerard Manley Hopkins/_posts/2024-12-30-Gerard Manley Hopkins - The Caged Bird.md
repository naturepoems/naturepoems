O wild west wind, thou breath of autumn's being,  
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead  
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,  
Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,  

Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,  
Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed  
The father of all things, and that thou art  
Who, in its fall, their monarch-passed thru drear,  

What cheer?  
Help nations on this pale, to help them, be  
Wracked on all sides and grant compassion—  
Though the stork stains and shield—a fall  
Or tear of zeal, or like enchantment  

Is gnawing yet, wet  
With the light for home; it spouse soft arms—  
Once, sound and setting in milk and knowledge!  
And music laughs, at first from its own ground  

To meet the light with thought—  
In nature.  

So wild west wind shall place she and e'en thou!  
I call upon the years of time  
For spirit three, through green and lonely  
To lift sweetness homeward—a sky to rest!

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
