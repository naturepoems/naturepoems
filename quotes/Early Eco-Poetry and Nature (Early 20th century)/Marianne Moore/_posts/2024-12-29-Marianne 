The Squirrel

The squirrel lies in the tree
Where slants of morning colors
Pour across, she holds her peace.

Swaying by the twigs,
The beat of sweetened circles,
Shadows along the levels, thus play,
While she reads the dawn!
There is reason for her stillness,
Climbing clear and green;
Numb territories remain enclosed;
To her itâ€™s blessings there beside.

Her joy hints guilty; half-ceiling low
For who is she to measure the world,
Yet grasping toward light!

- Marianne Moore
