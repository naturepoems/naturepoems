The Ponds

I have never been  to the place where black-eyed Susans  and daisies grow wild in the fields,  where the ponds reflect  the dance of birds and light,  where life ripples atop the water,  and the colors burst forth  from the earth.
What can I know  of that beauty?  I carry the images  folded close within me,  the sense of water and grace,  and I gather the dreams  of what that life must be.  And I think of meaning, of peace,  and how sometimes  I have felt part of it all,  although most times  I am only wishing.

- Mary Oliver
