The Negro Mother

I am the Negro Mother.
The mother of humanity,
The womb that gave birth to humanity:
With too much pain and sorrow.

I could not speak for a long time.
I could not speak until the bread,
The blood, the sweat of my people,
Poured like rain over the barren land.

Only then did I find my voice,
And the fertile ground ache with songs,
Of who I was, who I am,
Surely like the sun that rises,
Is the warmth of my love, yet unbroken.

- Langston Hughes
