The starlit sky, a vast expanse,
Holds dreams and wishes in its trance.
With every glance, a hope ignites,
In nature's breath, our souls take flight.

So let us wander, let us stray,
Through verdant woods and fields of hay.
In every moment, fully live,
For nature's love is ours to give.

- John A Alexander McRae
