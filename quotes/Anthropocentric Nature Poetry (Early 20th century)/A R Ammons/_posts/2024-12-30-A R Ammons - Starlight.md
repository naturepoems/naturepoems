Starlight

Under the starlight,
  everything rests,
  all the returns are silent,
yet the stars pulse gently
  above, mapping worlds
  of which I know nothing.

And yet there is a rhythm,
  a pulse beneath my skin;
each twinkle peeks in,
  fills me like a glass,
a cosmos seeks â€”
  I absorb it here,
carry it into the dark,
  a warmth,
a wisdom as deep as roots,
  as the stones lying quiet.
Time is offered under the stars,
  as all things breathe out,
  all things breathe in.

What could I hold?
  Only the moments of light, deftly,
  a balance of living and waiting,
living and waiting.

- A R Ammons
