Between Walls

The back wings

of the hospital

where nothing

will grow lie

between the buildings

and the trees.

The dead

will go on normally

in the walls.

Yet they are interred

and die in the soil

between heaven and earth

and in that silence

there is a shadow

which will always grow.

- William Carlos Williams
