The Toad beneath the harrow  
Knows exactly where it goes;  
It cannot simply happen  
To be anything it knows –  

Yet how can we suspect him  
Of being less than sure;  
Would he appease each Shadow  
Doth he so miss the Day?  

Which yet is but a promise –  
To the beauty which is bright;  
Upon the width of Wormwood  
May his life, disclose, tonight –  

And every future meeting  
Secures the rest, he holds –  
With every footfall known to him –  
Aside each flower that unfolds –  

And maybe, it grants –  
The colors in the Garden  
Though he never would discern  
The final Work – by Heart –  

That offers every Festival –  
But he’d not gasp it full –  
For he shall keep the wisdom –  
Fully closed, to fail  

Around the ceil – of Nature –  
In every Grain, that plays –  
The silence sure of Beauty burns  
To render it away!

- Emily Dickinson
