The Armful
For every parcel I stoop to secure,
I lose some other off my arms. I have
Too much. Just to stand there in the door,
I feel my burden dropping on the floor.

And as, I bend, I can barely stand,
With arms full of what cannot let go.
I must let go. I want even more,
But no object becomes an object so.

And I stretch just to stand, and can secretly,
Hold everything and not have to care,
See the children playing, so free and bright,
But I do not want them falling like that!

- Robert Frost
