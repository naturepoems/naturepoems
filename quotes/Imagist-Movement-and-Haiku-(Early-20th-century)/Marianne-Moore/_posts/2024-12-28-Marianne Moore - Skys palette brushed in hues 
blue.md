blue, gold, and rose at dusk,
ocean waves swallowing twilight's kiss,
dusky clouds weave dreams,
a tapestry unfolding,
whispers of tomorrow on the wind."

Sky’s palette, brushed in hues —
blue, gold, and rose at dusk,
ocean waves swallowing twilight's kiss,
dusky clouds weave dreams,
a tapestry unfolding,
whispers of tomorrow on the wind.

- Marianne Moore
