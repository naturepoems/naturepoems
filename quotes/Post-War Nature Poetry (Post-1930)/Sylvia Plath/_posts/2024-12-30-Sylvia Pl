In the folds of the forest,
   Salted air and petrichor ride,
Through the ferns like green-cast waves,
To cradle upon my face,
   Dappled images softly glancing,
Eager like a wren’s advance,
   The earth whispers her mosaic,
And I dance into the palms of trees.
   I breathe in the moisture,
The creek’s song h-cided pine, measuring time,
   And in swift haikus, the wind crescendos.

I can taste the remnants of your laughter,
   As it reverberates,
Tangled in the curl of brambles,
While shadows embrace me near,
   You are a sunlit clover,
Banished here but never gone,
Whispering in the spaces,
Between the flickers of teal dusk.


- Sylvia Plath
