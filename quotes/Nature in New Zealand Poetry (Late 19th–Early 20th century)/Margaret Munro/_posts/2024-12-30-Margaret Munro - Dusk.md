Dusk

When shadows lengthen, soft they fall,  
An evening hush envelops all,  
As twilight paints the world in gold,  
And silver secrets start to unfold.

The stars awake from daylight’s dream,  
In azure skies, they softly gleam,  
Each twinkle tells of stories old,  
Of nature’s wonders yet untold.

Oh, dusky time, with all you share,  
In silence, stillness fills the air,  
Beneath the twilight's gentle grace,  
I find my soul in nature's embrace.

- Margaret Munro
