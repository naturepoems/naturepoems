The Darkling Thrush

I leant upon a coppice gate
When Frost was spectre-gray,
And Winter's dregs made desolate
The weakening eye of day.

The tangled bind was bleached and dry,
And once more owls did cry
To mimic the clouded moon,
And then, a testy cry.

The poetâ€™s note, the weary sigh,
The gray-teared wind as a taut spy
To measure the hours ticked by,
The spectre gray, the helpless sigh.

In the center of a fading line,
I heard a thrush sing near divine.
And I thought of hope, of closed-eyed cheer,
His song, where do we find that year?

- Thomas Hardy
