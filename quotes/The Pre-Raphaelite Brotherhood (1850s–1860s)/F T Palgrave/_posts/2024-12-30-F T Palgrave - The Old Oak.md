The Old Oak
Beneath the old oak, wisdom grows,  
Where roots stretch deep and peace bestows;  
Its branches cradle dreams in flight,  
A haven where the heart takes light.  
The seasons change, yet still it stands,  
A sentinel of time, with ancient hands.  
In summer’s shade, in winter’s chill,  
The old oak nurtures with strength and will.  
Let us gather close, in its embrace,  
To share our stories, and find our place.  
For nature’s heart beats strong and wise,  
In every leaf, the world we prize.  


- F T Palgrave
