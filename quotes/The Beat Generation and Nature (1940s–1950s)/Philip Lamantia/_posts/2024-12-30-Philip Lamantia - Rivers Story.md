The river runs with a story
                of countless ages,
        reflecting the faces of stars
                      and trees,
the soft caress of petals resting
      on the water,
where dreams drift,
       and thoughts intertwine,
                  tangled in currents
                       of desire and time.

- Philip Lamantia
