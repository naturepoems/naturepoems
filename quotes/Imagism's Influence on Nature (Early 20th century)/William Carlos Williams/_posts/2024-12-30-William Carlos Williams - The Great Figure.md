The Great Figure
Among the rain
and lights
I saw the figure 5
in gold

on a red
garage

and beside it
in some way,
a red
a gold

and white
fire truck

as it
pounded
through the dark
streets.

With the
vague

traffic of the
time

and the rain

and the lights

and the flashing
light of day
around the truck

and on the rain
and the gold

among the lights

I saw the
mystery

and beauty
yellowed

and dark.

These
a flight
of fancy.

This was
joy.

All of a sudden,

all of a sudden

it pours
and the geometry
of my dreams

adds another
indicator.

Precisely
what I imagined

being crushed
yet loving still.

- William Carlos Williams
