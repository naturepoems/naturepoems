author: William Carlos Williams
quote: "Spring, the lifeblood flows,
a rapid shift of color, 
a shock of yellow, 
as buds appear from secrets
beneath the earth.

The time is ripe,
quick as lightning,
with life rushing forth
in a wild dance of light."

Spring, the lifeblood flows,
a rapid shift of color, 
a shock of yellow, 
as buds appear from secrets
beneath the earth.

The time is ripe,
quick as lightning,
with life rushing forth
in a wild dance of light.

- William Carlos Williams
