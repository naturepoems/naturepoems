The Thaw

In the thaw of winter's golden breath, 
When nature stirs beyond the death, 
And every branch with blossoms crowned, 
Awakens peace all around.

The quiet earth, begins to sing, 
In whispering tones, of life in spring, 
The frosty dreams now melt away, 
And greet the dawn of brighter day.

Let every stone, and seed rejoice, 
For in today, we hear the voice; 
Of changing times, the cycle flows, 
And life renews with tender shows.

- James Elroy Flecker
