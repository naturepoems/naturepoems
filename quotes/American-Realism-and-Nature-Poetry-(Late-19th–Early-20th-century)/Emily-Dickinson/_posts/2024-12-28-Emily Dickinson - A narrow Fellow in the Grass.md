A narrow Fellow in the Grass  
Occasionally rides;  
You may have met him - did you not  
His notice sudden is -  

The Grass divides as with a Comb,  
A spotted Boy - is seen;  
And then it closes at your Feet  
And opens further on -  

He is just a Grass snake, but thought  
To be an enemy -  
For it will fright you back of your brain  
By nature's aspirant wins.  

This Grass - take caution, and beware  
Your supplies are heightened no more,  
By nature's own meekness great -  
For what gives is less!

- Emily Dickinson
