Gentle hills roll beneath a blanket of fog,
Veiling the world in a shroud of dreams;
Nature whispers secrets through every breeze,
And softens our hearts to the whispers of time.

The rustle of leaves, a soft reminder,
That life flows in cycles, weaving through night;
In every shadow lies a spark of light,
A tapestry spun of nature's embrace.

- Anna de Noailles
