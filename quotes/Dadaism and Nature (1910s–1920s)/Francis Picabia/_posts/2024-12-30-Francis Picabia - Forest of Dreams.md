Forest of Dreams
In the forest where dreams grow,
every leaf tells a secret,
every branch is an arm reaching out;
each root twists like thoughts,
dancing under the earth's skin.

The air hums with the stories
of creatures unseen,
weaving a tapestry of sound,
a lullaby for the wandering soul.

Close your eyes, listen well,
and you might hear the wisp
of a forgotten song,
a hymn sung by the trees.


- Francis Picabia
