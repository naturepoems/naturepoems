The Dust

   The dust risesâ€”upwards,
   mixed with leaves and red firelight,
   remnants of the garden where seeds
   and passing breezes heed fully lurking,
   to swish together.

   In the frail sheening blend,
   memories start to part,
   spilling forth quiet over edges,
   in bursts of yearning; fields echo,
   dreaming of what could be.


- D H Lawrence
