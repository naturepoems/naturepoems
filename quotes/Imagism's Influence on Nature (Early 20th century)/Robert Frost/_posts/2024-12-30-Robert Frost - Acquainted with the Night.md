Acquainted with the Night
I have been one acquainted with the night.
I have walked out in rainâ€”and back in rain.
I have outwalked the furthest city light.

I have looked down the saddest city lane.
I have imagined defiance at the stars.
I have walked the blackest alley in my way.

And so, I have also heard the lonely rap
Of the sprinter's feet upon the cobblestones.
I have jogged down the heart of darkness, and yet,

I have found the truth behind its calls for me.
I am perhaps the close of day and night,
A traveler, alone, contemplating what to do.

- Robert Frost
