Dawn breaks gently,
The misty carves on lakes,
Ripples touch the trembling
Of sleeping giants,
The top of pine trees,
dreaming of horizons.

How I long for the song,
Of the first bird’s herald,
A tune echoing,
in the spacious dawn,
Nature’s pulse reflects,
in our heartbeat—
So intertwined,
With the rhythm of all that is.


- Anne Waldman
