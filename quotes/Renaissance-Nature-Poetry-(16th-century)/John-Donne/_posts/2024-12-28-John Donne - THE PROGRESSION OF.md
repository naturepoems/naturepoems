THE PROGRESSION OF LOVE

Love bade me welcome; yet my soul drew back,
    Guilty of dust and sin.
But quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack
    From my first entrance in,
Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning,
    If I lacked anything.
'A guest,' I answered, 'worthy to be here:'
    Love said, 'You shall be he.'
'I, the unkind, ungrateful? Ah, my dear,
    I cannot look on thee.'

Love took my hand, and smiling did reply,
    'Who made the eyes but I?'
'Truth, Lord; but I have marred them: let my shame
    Go where it doth deserve.'
'And know you not,' says Love, 'who bore the blame?
    My dear, then I will serve.'

'You will not hold your head above my knee,
    Nor continue suffering.'
'Yet this will not be said, 'Then I will be,
    And know your place to love.'

Love seemed to smile, and ready did grant,
And hear ye what I said â€” 'Take it still,
    For once I shall make you mine.'

- John Donne
