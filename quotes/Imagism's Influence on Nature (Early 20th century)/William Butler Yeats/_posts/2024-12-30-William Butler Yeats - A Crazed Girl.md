A Crazed Girl
O you maid of the mountain I've seen in the shroud,
As I stood by the river and called to you loud,
Like a fish you leapt as I murmured in heat,
And flowed with the flow of the swift rivers' beat.

What knows you that I know not, though I weep?
Your laughter like a flower in my breast will keep,
Like sunlight breaking into a new day,
In the rush of the morning and the dew's soft play.

- William Butler Yeats
