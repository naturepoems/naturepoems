Above the quiet fields,
The sky spreads like a canvas,
Every shade of blue shines,
A backdrop for daydreams.

Clouds drift like thoughts,
Floating in the vast unknown,
And far away the mountains loom,
Guardians of this serene space.

I gather this moment close,
Breathing in the universe,
A witness to the beauty,
That thrives in silence and light,
A part of all that is and will be.

- Richard Wright
