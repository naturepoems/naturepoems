The whispering streams that wind through the glade,
Pass secrets of nature in a soft serenade;
Where fern fronds flutter and wildflowers sway,
The essence of beauty in a timeless ballet.

Here time drips slowly, like honey from comb,
In the warmth of the sunlight, I find my true home.
To wander through woodlands, to breathe and to see,
In the heart of the wild, where my spirit roams free.

- David Jones
