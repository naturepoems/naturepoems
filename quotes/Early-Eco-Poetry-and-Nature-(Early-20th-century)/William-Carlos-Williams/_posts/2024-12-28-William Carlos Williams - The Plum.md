The Plum Trees

The plum trees

sway gently

in the summer wind,

their fruits hanging

like small promises,

the colors of the sun

in every droplet

of dew.

I wander through

these soft shadows,

their beauty

whispering secrets,

bringing the past

close to me,

teaching me

to cherish these moments.


- William Carlos Williams
