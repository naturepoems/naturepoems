Duns Scotus's Oxford

Fleecy shouldered, sloping o'er the boughs  
Of green, such accents near his ear arise,  
That rises up to heaven as it bows,  
Remarking so in deepened skies.

Strain happens, and twists him, men replace,  
Shout huzzas; so flaming a thought,  
As in the bosom claims, in grace,  
The earth speaks loyalty, being wrought.

â€” Gerard Manley Hopkins
