Shall I in my heart say
I am a wanderer
with no steady home,
a hobo living under bridges?
Or shall I say
I am a lonely bird,
waiting for wings?

It is one of lifeâ€™s mysteries
that when I wander
I gather the things of the earth,
the wind on my face,
the ground under my feet,
the shadows in the trees
and it makes me whole.

I ask the stars to cover me
and the moon to hold my hand,
I ask the sun to light my way
and show me the world in different lights.

- Carl Sandburg
