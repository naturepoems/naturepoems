Moonlit Night

Under the canopy of stars so bright,
Nature holds its breath in the moonlit night,
Gentle creatures stir from their day’s rest,
As the cool breeze whispers, nature's best.

The horizon drapes in a silken glow,
With dreams that float in the night’s soft flow,
Moments of peace, where hearts entwine,
In the stillness of night, all feels divine.

- David C Okwuosa
