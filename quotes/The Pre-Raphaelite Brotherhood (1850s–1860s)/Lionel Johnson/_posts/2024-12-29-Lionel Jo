The Shadow

Through crimson leaves that rustle low,  
A whispered breath touches my face,  
And in the cool of evening’s glow,  
My heart finds life in sacred space.

There shadows blend as daylight fades,  
And every thought whispers sweet,  
With secret depths where beauty wades,  
To set the soul on dreams with beat.

So shadow lifts, the twilight sighs,  
Where all the world finds joy at last,  
And through the night’s enchanted skies,  
Our hearts unite with all that’s past.

- Lionel Johnson
