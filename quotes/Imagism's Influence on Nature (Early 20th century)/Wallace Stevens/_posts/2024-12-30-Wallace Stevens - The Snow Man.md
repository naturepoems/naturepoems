The Snow Man

One must have a mind of winter
To regard the frost and the boughs
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;
And have been cold a long time
To behold the junipers shagged with ice,
The spruces rough in the distant glitter
Of the January sun; and not to think
Of any misery in the sound of the wind,
That is blowing in the sound of the wind,  
But as a sound among the sounds of the wind,
And the pine-trees crusted with snow.


- Wallace Stevens
