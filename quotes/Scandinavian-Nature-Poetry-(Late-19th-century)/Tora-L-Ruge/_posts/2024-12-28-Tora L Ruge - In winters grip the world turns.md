In winter’s grip, the world turns white,
A blanket soft, a tranquil sight,
The howling winds, the frozen trees,
In silence, nature's heart agrees.

Each flake a tale of journeys lost,\nYet beauty thrives, no matter the cost,
For even in the cold's embrace,
Life whispers softly, finds its place.


- Tora L Ruge
