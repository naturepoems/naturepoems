The Divine Image

To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,  
   All pray in their distress;  
And to these virtues of delight  
   Return their thankfulness.  

For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love  
   Is God, our Lord, they say;  
And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love  
   Is man, we find, in clay.  

For the Divine Image of God  
   And man, try as you may,  
Is not less than beauty and love,  
   It is the world’s own way.

- William Blake
