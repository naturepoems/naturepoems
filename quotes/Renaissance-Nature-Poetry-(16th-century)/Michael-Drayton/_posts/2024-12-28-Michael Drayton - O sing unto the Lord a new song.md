---

O sing unto the Lord a new song,  
For he hath done great things!  
His right hand and his holy arm  
Hath gotten him the victory.  

The Lord hath made known his salvation:  
His righteousness hath he openly showed  
In the sight of the heathen.  

He hath remembered his mercy  
And his truth toward the house of Israel:  
All the ends of the earth have seen  
The salvation of our God.

- Michael Drayton
