She was a phantom of delight  
When first she gleamed upon my sight;  
A lovely apparition, sent  
To be a moment’s ornament;  
Her eyes as stars of twilight fair;  
Like twilight’s, too, her dusky hair;  
But all things else about her drawn  
From May-time and the cheerful dawn;  
A dancing shape, an image gay,  
To solace me along my way.

- William Wordsworth
