Waves of Green

In the forest dense and deep,
Where whispers of the trees make sighs,
Amidst the leaves, secrets sleep,
In calm repose, the world complies.

Moss carpets the earth, a tender green,
Where thoughts drift softly, unconfined,
The brook sings sweet, a silver sheen,
In nature's arms, we find our mind.

Allur’d by breeze, the branches sway,
As sunlight dapples through the boughs,
Here in between the worlds we play,
Where silence hums, and peace endows.
