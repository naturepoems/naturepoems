In the garden, I find
solace in the blooms,
a tapestry of life,
each flower a note in the music
of the earth’s creation.

The roses proclaim love,
while the daisies dance—
and I listen,
as the hum of bees
fills the air with sweetness,
love notes to pollen,
a fragrant language of intent.

Nature teaches us,
of resilience, of beauty,
of storms and sunrises,
as I kneel in the soil,
hands deep in the earth,
a participant in this
sacred cycle of life.

- Alice Walker
