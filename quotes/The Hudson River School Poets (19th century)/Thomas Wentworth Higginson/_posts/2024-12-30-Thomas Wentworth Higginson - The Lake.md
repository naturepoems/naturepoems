The Lake
  
O placid lake beneath the filmy stars,
Your heart stands still, untouched by mortal wars—
Reflections curl like dreams upon your breast,
As ripples hover, gently showing rest.

And here in depths of tranquil ways, the blue
Unfolds in intricate patterns drawn anew;
Where silence moves and beckons for repose,
This dreamer’s haven where the spirit grows.

So let me wade into your shining grace,
And watch the twinkling glories fall from space;
For here within your calm, I find my home,
In nature’s trance—a world I can roam.  


- Thomas Wentworth Higginson
