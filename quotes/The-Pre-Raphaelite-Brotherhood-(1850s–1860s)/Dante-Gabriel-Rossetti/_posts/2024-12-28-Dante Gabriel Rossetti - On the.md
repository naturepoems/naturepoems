On the Eve

While space is sweet upon the morn;  
To fade upon the rocks, as fire,  
Forgotten winds, soft waves reborn,  
Track me in clear caress so dire.  

Eve has the charm of flow and grace of trails,  
Each flame is dead with fall so grey,  
And stillness cool and fetch of Fleets’s sails,  
Now kisses me to one field away.  

Yet nights that tremble soon, swoon broken brow,  
In branches close, while thought confines amiss;  
Should force behest if love be so low,  
For wandering hence to me, she'll kiss.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
