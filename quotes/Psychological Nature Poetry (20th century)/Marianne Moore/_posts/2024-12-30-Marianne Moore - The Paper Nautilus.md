The Paper Nautilus

From an infinitesimal food,
before birth, the handling
of twinkling spurs flexible spines
as trailer, becomes there. 

Translucent jelly, a difference must be
in the many fluorescent teeth symphony.
To speak of the not-visible dimension it can hide,
charmed, in degree.


- Marianne Moore
