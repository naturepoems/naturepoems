In every seed that finds the earth,
Lies hope, a spark, a dream,
In natureâ€™s hands, the future blooms,
In colors rich and supreme.

Through storms and drought, it learns to thrive,
Through struggle, it finds grace,
In nature's heart, we all can grow,
And find our rightful place.


- Hermann Hesse
