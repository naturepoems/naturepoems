The River's Song
A river flows with tales to tell,
Meandering through the vale so green,
Its gentle song, a lover's spell,
In every ripple, life is seen.

Stones that line the riverbed,
Guard secrets of the years gone past,
In its current, dreams are fed,
A dance with time thatâ€™s unsurpassed.

- Aasta Holth
