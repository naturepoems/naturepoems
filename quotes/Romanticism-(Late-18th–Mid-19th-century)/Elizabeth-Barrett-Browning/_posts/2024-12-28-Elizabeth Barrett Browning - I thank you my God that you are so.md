I thank you, my God, that you are so dear,
I thank you in my heart’s ceaseless prayer,
That these southern winds have come, I deem,
That you have made for me all things fair.

O that I could bear the burden all alone,
That I could send you the song of the bird,
And gather together all that I want,
And climb each knoll upon this earth unshod.

But the diamond trail to your heart must stay,
So I can never say, 'I have it all!'
Most I can love on in this night’s dark sway,
The silent sky around your name larger than all.


- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
