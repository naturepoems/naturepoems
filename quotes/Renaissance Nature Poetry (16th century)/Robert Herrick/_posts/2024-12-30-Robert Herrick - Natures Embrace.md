I have thee not, but still I see,
In emerald glades and mossy vale,
Thy shadow weaving gracefully,
Where sunbeams dance, there love shall sail.

These sights, these sounds, enchant my soul,
O let us roam where branches twine,
For nature's heart shall keep us whole,
And lay thy love as mine!

- Robert Herrick
