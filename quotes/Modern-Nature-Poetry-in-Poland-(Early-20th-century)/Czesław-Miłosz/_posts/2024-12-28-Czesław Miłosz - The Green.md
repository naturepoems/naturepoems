The Green Hill

The green hill,
where a lone tree stands,
a watchman of the ages,
kissing the sun's rays.

In the morning mist,
the dew holds promises,
softly caught
in the embrace of leaves.

I climb slowly,
every step brings me closer
to the pulse of nature—
its heartbeat in my veins.


- Czesław Miłosz
