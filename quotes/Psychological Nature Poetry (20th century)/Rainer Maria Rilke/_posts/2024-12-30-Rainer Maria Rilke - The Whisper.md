The Whisper

In the stillness between breaths,
The silence sings its soft refrain,
A whisper echoes between the leaves,
Drawing my spirit nearer, claiming me deep.

Among the petals of the lavender,
Each hue urges me to consider,
What it means to sit within this moment,
To feel the roots intertwine with the earth.

Dissolving, at last, the fever of existence,
I linger within these wild margins,
Where the wind itself carries secrets,
Soft as shadows, old as time's breath, 
Until silence becomes an endless song,
As I heed the call of the flora and fauna.

So let the worlds blend and merge,
Until we, too, are but whispers in the wind,
Dancing together in the tapestry of lifeâ€”
Breathless and free, so deeply alive.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
