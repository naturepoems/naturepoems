Fog

A subtle stroke blankets truth,
  across the narrowed streets, muted —
  holds life in a dreamstate —
     everything flows, 
        like whispers without words.
A longing sigh distills its grace,
   soft and paled —
     as figures appear, only to fade,
   wrapped in the elegant suspension,
       afloat in stillness.
Within the fog, I chase forms,
    lost in the paint of trust.

- Lorine Niedecker
