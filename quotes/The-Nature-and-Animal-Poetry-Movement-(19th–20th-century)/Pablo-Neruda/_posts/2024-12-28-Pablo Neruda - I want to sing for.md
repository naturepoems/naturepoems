I want to sing for you,
O Life’s green way,
through the spring’s open door,
where lilacs grow,
where birds burst forth
with a symphony,
so all who wander
discover home,
the bright garden of.
Let me be the flower,
the fruit’s sweet turn,
let me stir your colors
with a warm sunlight,
so we can dream together,
within the soft hum.
In this fertile moment,
time can lose its weight,
like petals that flutter
across the myriad sky.

- Pablo Neruda
