In the stillness of dawn,  
The frost glistens like diamonds,
Each blade stands tall, frozen
In tribute to time’s passing.
The world suspends above,
Breath caught in soft light—
As I walk on, wings of fog
Flow past like lost thoughts,
Nurtured dust circling around
Roots that fight still,
Underneath ancient stones,
Shivered under winter’s hand.

- Margaret Atwood
