The Sea and the Skylark

The sea is never still; its local moods,  
  Its fitful personalities,  
And every accent of that distance,  
  And every phase of the sky’s things.  

Sky-lark, to me,  
Thou neverest still, nigh thee in the sea,  
  Venus overhead uncontended cries
The hours austere, those friends of the  
  His songs—they are my ocean tides.
