A single feather drifts,
On a breeze carrying whispers,
Of stories untold. It lands,
Among the soft grass,
Where countless lives take root,
And the ground breathes rich life.
I watch in wonder,
As revolution unfolds,
Amid the tiniest miracles,
That flourish day by day.

               – From "Feather and Breeze"
