I noticed while walking the trail
The soft rustling of a nearby brook,
Like sweet conversations between friends,
Encouraging the green of the grass
To bloom and breathe under the warm caress
Of the sun; a bridge mingled with shadows,
Guiding me back to a deeper memory—
Lost laughter, a whisper of water,
And flowers that knew no time,
But to sing their colors into the air,
Rustling my mind back to a moment
Where breath becomes as infinite
As the quiet stretching of the hills.

— "Quiet Waters"
