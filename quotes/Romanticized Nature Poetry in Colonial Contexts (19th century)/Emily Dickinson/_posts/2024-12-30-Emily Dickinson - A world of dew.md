A world of dew  
A world of dew,  
And within a wall,  
That must remain in its deep?  

The sun—more like a Looking-glass  
Into it awakes,  
That tender Time would not forget!  

A wish upon the shapes to shine  
In thought, and warm—  
That draws a miracle upon—  

A world of dew!  

*A world of dew*

- Emily Dickinson
