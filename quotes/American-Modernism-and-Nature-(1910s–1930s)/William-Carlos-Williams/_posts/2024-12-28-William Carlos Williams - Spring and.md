Spring and All
I

By the road to the contagious hospital
under the surge of the blue
mottled clouds

crowds of the new

with the dead

I saw the woods of the

fallen trees flutter


upon the gray of the road

and I thought of the death of worlds

and how things change

and the renewal

that rises from the ashes and drains

into the flesh of the living trees.

II
When the last great

fear has passed and we go on

living in this wild place

it will have to do with

what has happened to us

and the waters will flow

and the winged sky will

open for us again.

- William Carlos Williams
