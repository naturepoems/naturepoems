  the coastlines blend,  
a soft sigh in the distance,  
a boat drifts alone,  
  unfastened,  
a lonely existence under the stars."

At dusk the sea is gray, quiet,  
  the coastlines blend,  
a soft sigh in the distance,  
a boat drifts alone,  
  unfastened,  
a lonely existence under the stars.
