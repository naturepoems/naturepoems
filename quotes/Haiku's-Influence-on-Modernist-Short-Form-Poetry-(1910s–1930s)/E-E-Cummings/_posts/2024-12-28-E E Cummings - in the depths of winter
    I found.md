quote: "in the depths of winter
    I found there was,
     within me, an invincible spring
        (that delineates day from night)
   growing more and more—
       climbing up—
          into joy"

in the depths of winter
    I found there was,
     within me, an invincible spring
        (that delineates day from night)
   growing more and more—
       climbing up—
          into joy
