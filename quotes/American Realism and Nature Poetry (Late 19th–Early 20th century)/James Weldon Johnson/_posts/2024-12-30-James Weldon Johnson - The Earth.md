The Earth

The earth is filled with beauty,  
   In every blade of grass,  
   In every corner of the world,  
   In the rising sun, that ever shall pass.

   It calls us gently, to look and see  
   The wonders around and within,  
   To embrace life’s rhythm, wild and free,  
   And know that in joy, we begin.
