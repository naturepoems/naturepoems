Wild Grapes

I come upon wild grapes —
  not the healthy clusters
  of the vineyards,
  but here, and there,
a few pale berries, tiny
  and round, dangling
from raw vines.

Every leaf, every stillness
  of the woods
  makes me stare,
  there is no bounty,
one could gorge,
one could eat, and I want
  for you to see how precious
  these wild things are —
they matter; they glow.
Nothing close and good
  can compare to their wildness;
yet they belong to shade,
  and wind.
Their bounty is here,
  however, beyond my reach.

- A R Ammons
