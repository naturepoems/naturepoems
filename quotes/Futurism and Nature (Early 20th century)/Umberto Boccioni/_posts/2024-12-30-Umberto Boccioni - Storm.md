Storm

Thunder clouds roll,
a parade of shadows,
vaulting the heavens,
cradled by the wind.

Raindrops carve paths
on thirsty soil,
tearing the heavy silence
with whispers of life.

They tell of brooks awakening,
of roots drinking deep,
of the earthâ€™s embrace,
renewal in every drop.

In this storm,
the wild heart beats,
crackling bolts of lightning
ignite the spirit,
celebrating the clash
between the eternal and the ephemeral.
