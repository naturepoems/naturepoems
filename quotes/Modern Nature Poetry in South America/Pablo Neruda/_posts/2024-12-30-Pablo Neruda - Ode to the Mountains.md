The mountains rise fiercely,
a testament of strength against time,
each peak a memory of stone,
a guardian of the weight of ages.
Their vastness humbles the heart,
echoes of winds that shape them,
a richness unmatched,
beyond the tender touch of man.

With my hands, I yearn to touch
that granite skin,
feel the chill of solitude,
a place where eagles soar high,
and thoughts dissolve in clarity.
How beautiful it is here,
where silence is a gift,
a muse in the presence of giants,
a stone paradise welcoming all.

- Pablo Neruda
