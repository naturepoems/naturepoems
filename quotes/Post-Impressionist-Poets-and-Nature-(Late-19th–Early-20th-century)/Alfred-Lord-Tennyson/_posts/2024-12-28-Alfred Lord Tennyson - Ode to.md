Ode to Memory

O Memory!—key of the poet’s treasures,
O treasure-house of soul and grace;
Thou whence the sweetest measure
And form and color come to the race!

The meadow’s green and the dusky hights,
The rose, the lily, the violets,
The songs of the birds at the morning light—
What sweetness in the thoughts that beget!

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
