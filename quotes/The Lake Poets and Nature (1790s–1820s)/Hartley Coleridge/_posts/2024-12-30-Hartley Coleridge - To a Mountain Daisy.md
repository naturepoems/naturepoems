To a Mountain Daisy

Wee, modest, crimson-tipped flower,  
Thou'st met me in life's early hour;  
When, careless of thy lowly bed,  
I saw thee rearing up thy head.

Thy story is a quiet one,  
Unseen by many, lost to none;  
The dewdrops cling, the sun doth shine,  
To raise thy face, sweet flower divine.

And when thou bloom'st in May's soft air,  
Thy grace might tempt the timid hare;  
Or gently sway in evening's breath,  
To cherish life beyond all death.

- Hartley Coleridge
