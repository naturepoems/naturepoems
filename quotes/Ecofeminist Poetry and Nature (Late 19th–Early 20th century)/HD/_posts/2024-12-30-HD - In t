In the Mountains

The mountains are braced
with the folds of hills,
  crystalline and bold,
and like a great silence,
  roll and wrap me.

The shadows fall.
The peculiar bloom
     draws close,
     darks the sun down.

What of the little flowers—
  half-way dreaming;
  the weight upon my heart?

H.D.
