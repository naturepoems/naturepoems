Ode to the Sea

O mighty Sea! thy waves roll high,
And dance beneath the sunlit sky;
With every crest that breaks upon the shore,
I feel the rhythm of time evermore.

Thou art a vast and rolling plain,
A mirror to the joy and pain;
In thee I see the age-old quest,
Of nature's heart, in thy embrace, we rest.

Together we shall swirl and dive,
In depths where secrets still survive;
O great Sea, in thy embrace I find,
The freedom of body and of mind.

- Thomas Woolner
