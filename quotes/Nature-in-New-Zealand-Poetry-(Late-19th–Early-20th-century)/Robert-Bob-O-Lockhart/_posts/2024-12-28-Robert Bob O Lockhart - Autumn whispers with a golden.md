Autumn whispers with a golden sigh,
As leaves pirouette and bid goodbye,
Crimson and amber in the gentle breeze,
Nature lays to rest, at her own sweet ease.

The world turns towards a slumbering state,
Where the harvest moon will illuminate fate,
In the quietude of a late afternoon,
Nature hums softly her lullaby tune.

- Robert Bob O Lockhart
