Each daybreak is a painter's stroke,
A blend of colors, pure and bright,
As birds swoop and dance in the sky,
Welcoming the sun's warm return,
A song of hope riding the breeze.

Beneath the vast expanse of azure,
The earth stirs with expectancy,
With every heartbeat, a promise,
That life flows on, fierce and tender,
A testament to dreams alive.


- Marian Zdziechowski
