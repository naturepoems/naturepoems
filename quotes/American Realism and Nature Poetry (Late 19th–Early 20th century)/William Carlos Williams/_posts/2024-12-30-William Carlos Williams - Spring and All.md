Spring and All

By the road to the contagious hospital
under the surge of the blue
mottled clouds—drifting
  the chaff and the thorn
of the dead,

has settled, the few
  blossoms that still fray
so careless, the talk
  of the flowers is low,

it takes summer
  to curve and brighten
it is cold still; but,
  life does return—

the whirl with rain
  and it pulls up[straw]

new green from the dry ground—
it is only just the way it must pass,

when the spring bends
  its spine under the past.


- William Carlos Williams
