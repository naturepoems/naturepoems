When Death Comes
When death comes
like the hungry bear in autumn;
when death comes
and takes all the bright coins from his purse
I want to step through the door full of curiosity,
wondering: what is it going to be like, that cottage of darkness?
And therefore I look upon everything
as a brotherhood and a sisterhood,
I look upon time as no more than an idea,
and I consider eternity as another possibility,
and I look to the black sky to see clouds,
but I want to come home after all, I want to be so full of life,
yes, that when it comes, I will not keep a single shrunken bone,
only rejoicing in my primal love.
And therefore, I look upon everything
that is and wonder:
what is it going to be like?

- Mary Oliver
