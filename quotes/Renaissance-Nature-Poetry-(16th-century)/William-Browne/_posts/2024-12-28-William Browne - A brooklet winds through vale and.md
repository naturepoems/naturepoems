A brooklet winds through vale and hill,
Where daisies dance on emerald beds;
Where pebbles lie, and waters spill,
In simple grace, their story spreads.

With every murmur, every smile,
The essence of the earth awakes;
And in this moment, every mile
Finds peace in joys that nature makes.


- William Browne
