In the depths of the forest,
Where the whispers of the wind  
Tangle like the souls of lovers,  
I linger, alone -  
The trees reach out with limbs,  
Their rough hands entreat,  
Calling in the night,  
With a flight of owls overhead,  
Secrets in the moonâ€™s embrace,  
And dreams flutter like leaves  
Dressing the ground in glory.

- Guido Gozzano
