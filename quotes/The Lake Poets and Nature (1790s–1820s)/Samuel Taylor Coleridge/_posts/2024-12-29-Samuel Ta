The Garden (Fragment)

In the mist of morning's blue,  
When clouds are dewed heavy,  
I breathe the summer's sweet,  
And seem close unto them!  
Amidst the gleaming ways—like fell providence here,  
I will my little Hymn encore  
An ever smile cheerful!  
These flowers I tease—and though uncertain, shall be fair  
With hints of green, that draws my blood anew!  
As scents appear! And, O, blooming flower!  
The gold of Nature lie dense,  
And I feel the mist foretell—though oft to weep they know;  
That dew be on there—before the tree!  
What sways in dreams, new hope shall be in, too,  
As each bloom pricks on heart be at soft hours!—

- Samuel Taylor Coleridge
