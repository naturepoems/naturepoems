The Lark Ascending
Awake! the lark begins her flight,  
Through golden rays, into the light.  
With wings outstretched, she soars on high,  
Her song a tribute to the sky.  
In sunlit air, she twirls and dives,  
A symbol of hope, where freedom thrives.  
From vale to hill, her voice will ring,  
Unfurling dreams as the dawn takes wing.  
O lark! your melody, pure and sweet,  
Sets the heart dancing, its rhythm complete.  
In the vast expanse of sky so blue,  
You remind us all of what we can do.
