Auguries of Innocence

To see a World in a Grain of Sand  
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,  
Hold Infinity in the Palm of your hand  
And Eternity in an Hour.

A Robin Redbreast in a Cage  
Puts all Heaven in a Rage.  
A Dove house fill’d with doves and pigeons  
Shudders Hell thro’ all its regions.

A soul’s lighted in the dark,  
In the torment of the sacred spark;  
And the temptress sings by the stream:  
‘Take me at thy good will and dream.’

He who bends to a leaf will grow,  
And thou who dares not bid thee flow  
Must miss the world of which thou art due.


- William Blake
