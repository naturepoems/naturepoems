To Autumn

O thou who passest thro' our vallies in
Thy Chariot of the Sun,
                                      
Crown'd with the harvest of the golden grain,
                    
And loftiest hills, and in the woods,
                                  
   The leaves are falling fast,
  Oranges, and fuchsias red,
And gleaming seeds upon the ground--

While all of Nature doth rejoice,
And all the stars do sing,--

I would gather the fruits of the season,
But thou knowest that I am weak,
And cannot bear the rain.

O, thou who measures the corn,
And markest the plough with thy feet,
I am full of gladness for thee
And wouldst offer my heart, my soul, my being;  

But—O, thou hast gone away!

- William Blake
