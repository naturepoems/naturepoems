Heaven-Haven

I have desired to go  
Where springs not fail,  
To fields where flies no sharp and treacherous hail,  
And a few can be bright unbending mills,  
And the boys come out to reap.

If thou have not known this will  
Then feel me where love’s strong shall and skill remain,  
When thou dost cross a foam-gloss, and so  
Journey on, being the light as long as preaches  
And my shadows haunt the past of thee.

— Gerard Manley Hopkins
