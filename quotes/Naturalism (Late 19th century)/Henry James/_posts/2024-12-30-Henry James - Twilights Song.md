At evening's fall, the shadows play,
Turning gold to a silvery gray.
The stars awake with gentle grace,
As twilight's touch caresses space.

Beneath the canopy of night,
The world transforms, hidden from sight.
Yet in silence, life still thrives,
In nature's heart, where magic survives.


- Henry James
