A Field of Clover

Oh, spread the fields with clover sweet,  
And let the breezes ever play;  
The fluttering bees, their dance repeat,  
In golden sun, they find their way.  

The tender grass, the blooms so rare,  
A tapestry of green delights;  
Each petal kissed by gentle air,  
As day unfolds to starry nights.
