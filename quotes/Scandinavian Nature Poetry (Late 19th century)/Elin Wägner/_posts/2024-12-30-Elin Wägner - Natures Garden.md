Beneath the leaves, a carpet lies,
Of emerald green, where shadows hide.
The rustling branches serenade,
As sunbeams dance, and glades cascade.

Here lies a world both pure and bright,
A sanctuary of breath and light;
With every step, the wildflowers bloom,
In nature’s garden, I feel at home.

- Elin Wägner
