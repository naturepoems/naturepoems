The Tables Turned
Up! up! my friend, and quit your books;
Or surely youâ€™ll grow double;
Up! up! my friend, and clear your looks;
Why all this toil and trouble?

The sun above the yardarm shone,
And at your suit I reckon,
But how of all this sitting here,
And pruning in discomfort?

Sweet is the lore which Nature brings;
Our meddling intellect
Misshapes the beauty of her kings,
Yet it can still protect!

- William Wordsworth
