quote: "Through the mist, a figure emerges,  
Wrapped in the gown of the morning fog,  
A whisper of a woman, glowing soft,  
Tending to the blooms that thirst for light,  
Nature’s gardener, patient and wise."

Through the mist, a figure emerges,  
Wrapped in the gown of the morning fog,  
A whisper of a woman, glowing soft,  
Tending to the blooms that thirst for light,  
Nature’s gardener, patient and wise.
