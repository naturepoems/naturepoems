The soft hum of the world,  
a symphony of rustling trees  
aided by the hand of the wind;  
this orchestra moves in time  
with the rhythm of life’s tender heart—  
slow and steady, pressing on,  
in the depths of all things green.  

And I, a witness to this glory,  
find myself rooted,  
yet reaching—  
just a dreamer among the blossoms,  
a voice turned toward the light.

- Marilynne Robinson
