The Great Figure

among the rain
and lights

I saw the figure 5
in gold

on a red
a fire truck

moving

tense

yellow

glare

of the siren

whistle
in the night

like a

(entering)

on the slot of

red

with an edge

I steal the bank

note

looking back.

and see it.

The big 

city

like a river

moving

and dark.

Day and night.

It told me that

you are.

That is
all.

- William Carlos Williams
