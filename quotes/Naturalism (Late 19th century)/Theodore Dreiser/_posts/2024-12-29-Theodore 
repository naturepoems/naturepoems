Stars Above

The stars, they twinkle in the night,
      like diamonds set on black,
A thousand dreams may find their way,
      upon their glowing track;
In this vast celestial expanse,
      the universe unfolds,
Each star a wish, a memory,
      a tale that must be told.

As I gaze into the endless sky,
      my heart begins to soar,
For in this beauty, bold and bright,
      I feel I am no more;
I merge with every twinkling light,
      each whisper of the night,
In natureâ€™s grand, eternal dance,
      I am beyond all sight.

- Theodore Dreiser
