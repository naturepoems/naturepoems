Adlestrop

Yes, I remember Adlestrop—
The name, because one afternoon
Of heat the Express train drew up there
Unwontedly. It was late June.

The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.
No one did. But all of us listened.
The passengers, only a few, once more
Arose to stretch out and shake some dust—

All of the charm became that stillness,
In that rabbits' field light slowly falling,
In the warm sunshine, in that breathless blue.

All the songs of the June were present.

— Edward Thomas
