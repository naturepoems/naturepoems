An Autumn Day  

How still the trees! How free the air!  
Delightful morn! How bright and rare;  
The brilliant sun without a cloud,  
Which works to bless a world so proud!  

The foliage falls, the flowers fade;  
In fate, there's yet — a serenade.  
Those dark and fading hues invite  
The memories lost, now soft, and bright.  

Each passing hour brings forth its pains,  
The dew-drops dance about the plains;  
Thou with thy golden shields shall break,  
A path to peace for life's own sake.

- William Hazlitt
