Southern Alps

Draped in snow, the Southern Alps gleam,  
A tapestry woven from nature’s dream,  
Their peaks stand as challenges, bold and steep,  
Guardians of valleys where secrets sleep.

With every footstep on the winding track,  
We tread on histories, no turning back,  
In the expanse of wilderness, we find our way,  
A journey of the spirit, day after day.

Oh, let us cherish these mountains so grand,  
A legacy of beauty across the land,  
For in the stillness where silence reigns,  
We touch the essence of nature’s pains.

- P E J M Taylor
