Living Together
by W. S. Merwin

We pass through strands of the sea leaves
One above, one below, we speak
In a silent language of ripples and waves,
Twisting around the air
And threaded in the space where we swim,
Among the stars, a song of the forest
That winds through our thoughts like dusk.

- W S Merwin
