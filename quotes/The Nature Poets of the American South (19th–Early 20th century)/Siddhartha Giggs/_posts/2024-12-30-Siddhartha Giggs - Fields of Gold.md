The golden fields sway with the whispering breeze,
Chasing the shadows of ancient trees.
Each grain a heartbeat, each stalk a sigh,
In the dance of the Earth, I learn how to fly.

Butterflies flit on a sunlit quest,
In vibrant colors, nature’s artists dressed.
Their delicate wings tell of life’s fleeting grace,
In the beauty of moments, I find my place.
