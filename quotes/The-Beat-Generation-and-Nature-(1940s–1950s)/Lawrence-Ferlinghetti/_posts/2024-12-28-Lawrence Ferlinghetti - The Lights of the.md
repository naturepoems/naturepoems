The Lights of the West
The lights of the West
are the last to die
at the end of the world
and the sun sinks down
slowly with the music
of the coming night

It is young now
this sky
still lingering on
Shaking off the days
and falling into night

The last lover
leans back
and closes her eyes
under the broad palm trees
and stares up into the starlight

and the lights
of the West
are still twinkling
just a few
points of light
resisting the night

- Lawrence Ferlinghetti
