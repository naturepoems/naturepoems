This World

This world is not  
     just a place of light and dark,  
     but indigo nightâ€”  
     the slow breath of the earth,  
     the sighs of trees,  
     the murmurs of life code,  
     singing through aisles of winter stars,  
     a vibrant pulse,  
     holding hope tenderly,  
     singing what is lost in the dark,  
     embracing all the dreams yet to unfold.

- Mary Oliver
