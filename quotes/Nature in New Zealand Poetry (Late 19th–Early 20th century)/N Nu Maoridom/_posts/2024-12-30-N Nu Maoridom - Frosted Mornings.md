Frosted Mornings

When icy breath adorns the trees,
And winter's chill is felt with ease,
The world transformed, a crystal sheet,
In quiet stillness, beauty meets.

Each flake a gem, unique, divine,
In nature’s art, the stars align,
With every frost, a moment's grace,
In winter's heart, I find my place.
