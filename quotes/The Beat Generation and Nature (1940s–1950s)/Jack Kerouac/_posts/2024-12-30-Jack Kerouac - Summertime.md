Summertime

The summer light pours
through open fields,
making golden paths
through the bent grasses,
as I wander aimlessly,
with the sun setting low.

There is no hurry now,
nothing left to chase,
just the steady hum
of the cicadas,
and the sweet scent
of rippling heat,
a warm kiss upon 
the brow.

In this moment, I find
peace, a starlit sky,
a mirror to my soul,
reflecting what’s possible
in the call of each bird,
each blade of grass,
and laughter that flows
easy as the brook.
