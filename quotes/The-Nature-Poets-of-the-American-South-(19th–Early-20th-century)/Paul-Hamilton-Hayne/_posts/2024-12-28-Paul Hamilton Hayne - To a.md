To a Flower

Beneath the skies, amid the dew,
In innocence of budding bloom,
I stand and ponder thoughts of you;
What seems a whisper in the gloom:
Your petals tremble, softly sway,
With light of hope and dreams beyond,
The painted butterfly at play,
And melody of birds respond.
O flower! once again I see
Your form of beauty rise and gleam;
Reminding me that joy shall be,
Like fragrant breath of distant dream.
