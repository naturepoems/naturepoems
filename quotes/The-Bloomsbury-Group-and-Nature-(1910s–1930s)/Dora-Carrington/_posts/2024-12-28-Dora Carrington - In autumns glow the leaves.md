In autumn’s glow, the leaves cascade,
With fiery hues that gently fade,
Each step a crunch, a echo sweet,
As Nature’s breath brings forth the heat.
The crispness cuts the summer's haze,
In rich decay, a dance of praise,
The world transforms in vibrant kiss,
Where time suspends in tranquil bliss.

The harvest moon in silence glows,
And beckons forth the winter's prose,
I tread the paths where shadows play,
And greet the dusk with soft ballet.
O solemn dusk, as stars ignite,
In Nature's arms, the day takes flight,
An endless cycle, life’s refrain,
Where autumn's heart finds love again.

- Dora Carrington
