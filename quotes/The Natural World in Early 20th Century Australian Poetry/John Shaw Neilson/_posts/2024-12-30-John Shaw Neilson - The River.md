The River

The silver river winds away,
    Through valleys deep and wide;
It tells of secrets night and day,
    As time flows with the tide.

Each ripple holds a song divine,
    Each wave a tale of truth;
For in the heart where dreams entwine,
    It mirrors naught but youth.

- John Shaw Neilson
