Here dead lie we because we did not choose
To live and shame the land from which we sprung.
Life, to be sure, is nothing much to lose;
But young men think it is, and we were young.

So, though we lie in the earth and love the sun,
We know it is the time of knowing this,
To young men do we owe all we have done,
And letteth all repent our youthful bliss.

- A E Housman
