To Helen

I
  Helen, thy beauty is to me
     Like those Nicean barks of yore,
     That gently, o'er a violet sea,
     The weary, wayworn wanderer bore
     To his own native shore.

II
  On desperate seas long wont to roam,
     Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
     Thy naiad airs have brought me home
     To the glory that was Greece,
     And the grandeur that was Rome.

III
  Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche
     How statue-like I see thee stand,
     The starlight through thy window rich,
     Great waves, in the confines of the land,
     And thou art both wild and grand.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
