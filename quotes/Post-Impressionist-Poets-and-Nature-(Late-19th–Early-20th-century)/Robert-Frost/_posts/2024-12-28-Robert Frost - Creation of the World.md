Creation of the World  
The clouds hung so low that  
The curious snow fish fell  
Into the ponds and streams.  
It was a day warmed only  
By the heart's fire of desire.  
I watched the world awaken  
On a fringe of shadow,  
And a life began somewhere  
Filling the void above the ground.

- Robert Frost
