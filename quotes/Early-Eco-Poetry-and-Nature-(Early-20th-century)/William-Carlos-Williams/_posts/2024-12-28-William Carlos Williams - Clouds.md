Clouds

Beautiful clouds

drifting past,

yellow and orange

against a blue sky,

blown here by

the winds of change,

they speak of

invisible journeys,

carry with them

the heavy rains

that quench our thirst,

ease the dry earth.

Are they not

like us, always moving,

seeking and searching

for the place

we call home?


- William Carlos Williams
