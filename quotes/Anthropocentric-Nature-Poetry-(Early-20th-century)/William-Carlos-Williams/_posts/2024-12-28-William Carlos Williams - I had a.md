I had a dream
  That I was looking for a place
  To plant a tree.
  And I searched for it among the leaves,
  And found it by the river.
  I was bound to that spot, and
  To what lay beyond,
  Where the moon was making love
  With the mist. 

  And the grass was two feet deep.
  And there were birds singing.
  And the ground was soft
  With the sunâ€™s   
  Laughing breath.
  And my heart was  the same    
  As the wind.
  
  It was from my dream,
  From the sky  always   
  The same, that I wanted to be free,
  A cloud milking the shine of the day.

- William Carlos Williams
