Whispers of the Wood

In the hush of the evening,  
When the world is still and dim,  
The woodlands whisper softly  
As the stars in the sky swim.  
They speak of the winds that linger,  
Of the shadows that dance and play,  
Of the dreams that hum in silence  
And fade with the closing day.

Oh, heart of the forest deep,  
What secrets you keep so dear!  
I listen for the echoes,  
I feel your spirit near.

- A E George William Russell
