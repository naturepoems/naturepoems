In the heart of the woods, where silence reigns,
Where sunbeams play in the verdant glades,
Nature spreads forth her wide domains,
And in her arms, all sadness fades.

So pause, dear traveler, and breathe it in,
The pine-sweet air and the cool, clear streams;
For in her wildness lies the key,
The pulse of life, the threads of dreams.

- Henry David Thoreau
