Earth's Answer  
Earth's answer, the tell-tale bird  
Who woke me, and led the world awhirl  
Through the steel woods, and past the vale  
Of shadows pale.  
  
Like a spear out of the night,  
Like a leaf of bliss:  
I’ll catch the light;  
I’ll come through to this!  
  
And these hands that knew  
The delight and trust,  
Will fall into the dust  
If the art, beauty, and grace be too.  
**William Blake**
