TO L. J.

Ah, what fragrance from your eyes!
   Rose and honey in a mix,
That lure the bees so naturally,
   As wands in harvest spin their tricks.

Let not the thorns that guard your bloom,
   On cruel paths cast shades of red;
But drink to me the honeyed dew,
   As we dance beneath the bed.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
