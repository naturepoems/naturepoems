If you can keep your eyes
and ears open, it’s all slow:
slow winds, and silent
hills under winter snow.
From the sky came a cloud,
a thimble turning white,
a mote, a drift, a handful
of light, yes, the dim sights.
Everywhere, there’s wealth,
no need for zeal: let things
be well...
The moon comes and goes,
like the sun seeking the sea,
serene among the stones
of the restless sea.
