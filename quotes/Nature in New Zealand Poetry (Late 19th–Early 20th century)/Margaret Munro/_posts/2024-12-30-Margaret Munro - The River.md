The River

I watched the river's silver flow,  
And heard the whispers soft and low,  
As willows wept beside the bank,  
And sunbeams danced with light and prank.

The tranquil depths did hold the skies,  
With little boats of swans that rise,  
In gentle arcs and graceful sway,  
Chasing the dusk, inviting day.

Oh, river wide, you carry me,  
Through grassy banks and willow trees,  
From mountains high to ocean's bed,  
In your sweet current, dreams are fed.

- Margaret Munro
