Amidst the rush of the city, 
    where concrete battles green,
    a small patch of earth stands proud, 
    defiant against the chaos.  

There, daisies and dandelions
    bloom fiercely, 
    their colors a whisper 
    of Nature’s tenacity, 
    reminding us of softness, 
    amidst the hardness of life.  

Let us not forget, 
    in our pursuit of the grand, 
    the beauty of the humble, 
    blooming unseen, 
    yet so vividly alive.
