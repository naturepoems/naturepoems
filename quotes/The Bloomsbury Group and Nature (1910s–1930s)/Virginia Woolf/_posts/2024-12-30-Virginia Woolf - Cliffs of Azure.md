Upon the cliff’s edge,
The world threads the breeze,
Changing glances to waves,
A dance of existence,
Where sea and sky collide
And release the spirit’s mirth.
There you’ll find horses of foam, 
Racing lines of azure,
Marked by the hand of nature’s brush,
Writing love letters to the bold traveler
Chased by the winds of mirth.

— **Virginia Woolf, Cliffs of Azure**

- Virginia Woolf
