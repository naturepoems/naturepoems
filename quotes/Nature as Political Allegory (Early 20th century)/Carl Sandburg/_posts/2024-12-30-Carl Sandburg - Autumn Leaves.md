The leaves of the autumn
Have no colors -
They are weary, tired,
And quietly drift down.

The winds that are passing
Through their branches,
Bring a reminder of places
And lives gone by.

When the rain comes
And pierces their knees,
It is all falling,
All falling this way,
And then another year.

It becomes a dance of changes,
As we look upon the sky,
And marvel at the shades
That stretch from greens to browns.


- Carl Sandburg
