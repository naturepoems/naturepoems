Nature, to the child's sweet sleep,
Doth promise plenty from her hand,
For every bud that opens deep
Knows well she gives the gentle rain.

The sunlight warms the air anew,
And every object sings to thee,
That surely morning dazzles through,
In every field, on every lea.

Her bounty calls me through the night,
To seek the stars that gather close,
Amid the dreams, for fun delight,
On paths of moss, yet to be chose.

So move, dear child, towards the dawn,
Let music fill the blooming day,
For every note of childlike song
Will take our troubles far away.

- Matthew Arnold
