The tranquil lake reflects the sky,
A mirror of the clouds so white,
While in its depth, the fishes lie,
And dance with joy beneath the light.

The grasses sway along the shore,
In rhythmic motion, soft and kind;
And every sound, the earth's sweet roar,
Is whispered softly to the mind.

So let me linger by the tide,
And breathe the peace that nature brings;
Here by the lake, my heart will bide,
In every song the forest sings!

- George Gordon Byron
