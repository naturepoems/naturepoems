Earthworm
Be glad, my friend,
in shadows here on earth,
we are bound together,
like the fibers the trees hold,
we are a part of the wild,
our roots entwined,
a whisper calls through this dampness,
a soft comfort in the body,
a glow between the silt.

Among stones we linger,
a breath of every worm —
as earth moves where spring is full,
yet our bodies are savored,
poor through our living, like stars.
Low in purpose,
we breathe one another,
like rain between leaves,
this angle of the sky,
where chances blend —
it is a circle,
a vibrant kiss,
a mosaic letter,
never ask again.

O touch my soul,
like labor of the wind,
we hold the signs of life,
one flesh among many,
earthworms in our hearts,
our lives are whole,
we are the song in skins which rises,
comfort held between thorns,
a bin of pure embrace.

- Lorine Niedecker
