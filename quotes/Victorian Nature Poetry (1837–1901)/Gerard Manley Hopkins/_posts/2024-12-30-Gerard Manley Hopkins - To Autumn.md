The wreck of the flocks  
Grows brightly on hills,  
While wind plays its wandering  
Wisdom  
Within softest springs;  
Time shifts a tale  
And like bubbling lives all bend like wisps—  
It is the eye of light!  

To see, where wonders run  
To blessed renewal to a pulse green,  
What day can bloom?  
While friendship stirs about!  
Then to learn that heaven keeps  
The world to soft array;  

To each given hour  
With minute arms,  
And passing’s shafts that greet,  
where man builds homes—a wonder, a turn—in between.  

  
Oh, ceasing and shifting comes with such,  
For beauty thins through itself  
Like earth’s delight,  
And souls!  
To tender hymns, no sour time!  

In season  
Is every leaf bending!/  
And ever still the law of wind!  
Again I love life!  
I!/  
Dare pregnant the soul seeks tenderness—  
Changing through space!

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
