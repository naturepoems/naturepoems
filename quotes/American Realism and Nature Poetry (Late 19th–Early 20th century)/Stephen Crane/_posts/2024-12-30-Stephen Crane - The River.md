The River

I stood beside the river's bank
And watched the water flowing,
It was singing to itself a song,
A song that was full of sorrow.
I felt its moist breath on me,
I felt the mist of its voice
As I gazed at the rippled banks.
'This,' thought I, 'is life,  
This is the nature of things.'

- Stephen Crane
