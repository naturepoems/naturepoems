When, with the sun's warm breath, every hill  
Doth bloom and burst with vibrant light,  
I find in every gentle thrill,  
The echo of nature's pure delight.

A stream of whispers flows so clear,  
The world enfolds a beauty vast;  
Each season calls, but here, my dear,  
The verdant summers are steadfast.
