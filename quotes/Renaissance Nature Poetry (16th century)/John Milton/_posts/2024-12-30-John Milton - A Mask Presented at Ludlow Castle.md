A Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle
The nymphs are called;
From hill and dell, and woods enchanted,
They gather round, as music’s breath is chanted.
The waters dance, in rings of joyous sound,
The flowers tremble, where sweet peace abound.
Nature rejoices in the evening’s grace,
And all is seen as a sacred place. 

For every leaf sings with delight,
And in the twilight, shadows hold the light.

- John Milton
