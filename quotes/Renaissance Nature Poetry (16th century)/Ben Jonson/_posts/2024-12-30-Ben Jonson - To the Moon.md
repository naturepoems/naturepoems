To the Moon

Twinkle, though pretty, if thou dost feel,
  As bright seest yet upon the mind,
Then faith alone shall weave thy wheel,
  As tulips dance and grow half blind.

   As twilight whispers soft and low,
   Each wave that dances 'round the glade,
And dreams we taste, they surely show,
  How night gives each and all a shade.


- Ben Jonson
