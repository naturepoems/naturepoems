There is a gladness when the green trees tremble  
And souls come stir within the wooded gloom;  
And songs awaken from silence, gently and slow,  
Where the sight of fallen leaves shall one day die,  
And twinkling stars in phantom flames collide,  
To spread their fragrant light divine through days of fog around.

- Lord Byron
