The Manor Farm

The farm, a haven in the dappled shade,
Where shadows play and leafy whispers sigh,
Contentment reigns; no hurried step betrayed,
The tranquil eye of evening's purple sky.
Nocturnal calls and rustling creatures speak
Of nightly vigils in the hay"s soft folds,
While lamps within cast homespun glow and streak
The tranquil scene that daylight's beauty molds.

A hallowed peace, the essence of repose,
Where silence fills the golden, sunlit air,
And nature, softened, cradles with her woes,
Invites the weary heart to linger there.
This farm, a world where time and cares suspend,
Beholds the quietude of life, my friend.

— Edward Thomas
