In stillness I find peace,
Amidst the rustling leaves,
The gentle hum of life,
In every shadow cast.

Sunlight filters through branches,
A golden smattering of touch,
Awakening the undergrowth,
With whispers of yesterday.

I walk this path of wonder,
Each step a love note to nature,
Connected to the heartbeat,
Of the earth’s endless embrace,
In the sanctuary of green.

- Richard Wright
