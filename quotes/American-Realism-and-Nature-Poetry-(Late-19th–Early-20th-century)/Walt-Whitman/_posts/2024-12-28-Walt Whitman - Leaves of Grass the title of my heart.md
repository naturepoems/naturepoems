Leaves of Grass, the title of my heart,  
  In every fold, the essence of life,  
I find in nature’s sacred script,  
  All beauty, all shade, all strife.  

Each page turns with the breath of the earth,  
  Life's stories written with stars and with sighs.
I stand beneath a canopy of stars,  
  Finding solace in darkening skies.  


- Walt Whitman
