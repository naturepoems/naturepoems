The stars above in velvet night,  
whisper dreams to those who hear;  
in their glow, we find the light,  
and in their depths, a vision clear.
\nThey twinkle like the thoughts we keep,  
in constellations traced in time;  
a tapestry where wishes leap,  
a perfect canvas, quite sublime.

- John Dewey
