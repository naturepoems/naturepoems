The Wind

O wanderer out of the West,  
Have you a word for me,  
Wild-hearted Wind, that has blown my soul  
Through the sweet journeying trees?  
I would ask but the silence of beauty  
Calls me to breathe and to be  
A part of the joy unfolding  
In the fair land I see.

O ship of the night, that sails the sky,  
In sorrow and love I roam,  
O wayward Wind, that singest a song,  
My heart shall wander home.

- A E George William Russell
