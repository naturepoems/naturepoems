Alone within the emerald vale,
Where the shadows of the mountains yawn,
The whisper of time and the ancient trail,
Stirs the winds of the quiet dawn.

Through the cover of the leaves' embrace,
Murmurs of creation are cherished and bold;
In the depth where the treasures find space,
The heart will unfold its wonders untold.


- Louis MacNeice
