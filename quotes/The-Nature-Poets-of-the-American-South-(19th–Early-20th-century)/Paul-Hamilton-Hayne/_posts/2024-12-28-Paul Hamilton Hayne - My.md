My Woodlands

Here in the ancient woodland shade,
Where still the fern and flower abide:
The grasping hand of man hath made
Few inroads on the wild hillsides.
The winds that through the branches blow,
Still whisper secrets of the past;
Where in the warm, green gloaming glow
The lizard and the fawn drift fast.
I roam these paths without a care,
Beside the streamlet, sweet and slow;
I know my woodlands everywhere,
No summer day can ebb their glow.
