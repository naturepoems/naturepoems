Blade of Grass
A tiny blade of grass,  
beaten by storms and sun,  
yet it holds the weight of worlds,  
unsung under heavy skies,  
a hero in its quiet fight.

Beneath the feet of giants,  
it bends but never breaks,  
holding on to its place,  
rooted deep in the earthâ€™s embrace,  
a testament to resilience,  
an anthem sung by the earth.

- Ruth Padel
