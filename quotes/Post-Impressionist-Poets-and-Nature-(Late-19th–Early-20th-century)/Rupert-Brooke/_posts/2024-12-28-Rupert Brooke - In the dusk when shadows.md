In the dusk, when shadows creep,
The roses tremble, pale and meek.
Within their petals dreams they keep,
In every breath, their silence speaks.

Among the night, the stars shall wane,
A tender moon with silver glows.
And softly, in this sweet refrain,
The hush of nature’s heart bestows.


- Rupert Brooke
