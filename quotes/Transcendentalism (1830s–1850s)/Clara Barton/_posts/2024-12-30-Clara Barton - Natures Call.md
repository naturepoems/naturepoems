Nature's Call

The scent of pine, the call of streams,
Awake the wandering heart within;
Nature’s choir sings of dreams,
Where every journey shall begin.

In every rustle, in every sigh,
The story whispers through the years;
Come wander forth, let spirits fly,
Amidst the trees, where joy appears.

- Clara Barton
