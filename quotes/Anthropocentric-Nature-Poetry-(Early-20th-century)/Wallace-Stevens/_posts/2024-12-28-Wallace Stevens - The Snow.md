The Snow Man

One must have a mind of winter
To regard the frost and the boughs
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;
And have been cold a long time
To behold the junipers shagged with ice,
The spruces rough in the distant glitter
Of the January sun; and not to think
Of any misery in the sound of the wind,
That is what snow is.

For the listener, who listens in the snow,
And, not to think
Of any misery in the sound of the wind,
Must think
Of the cold that is not
As the vitality of the cold brings
An aware of the snow
To where the shadow of the tree is,
And on those distant bushes,
The gaze that finds no comfort.




- Wallace Stevens
