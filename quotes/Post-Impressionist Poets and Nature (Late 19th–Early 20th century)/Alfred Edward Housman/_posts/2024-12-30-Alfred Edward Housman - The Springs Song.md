And when the spring’s sweet song does rise,
Amongst the blooms, the laughing skies,
I’ll take my time, delight in each,
For nature has so much to teach.

The seasons change and come anew,
But in their wake, the earth renews,
A cycle grand of life and love,
In harmony with all above.


- Alfred Edward Housman
