Skyward

Look up!â€”to the vast expanse,
a canvas painted in hues of azure,
clouds waltzing softly,
a ballet in the high winds.

The sun, a blazing orb,
a herald of warmth,
blinding only if you gaze too long,
its rays pierce through the veil,
revelatory, fiery truths.

Night removes the light,
stars ripple in the black,
a cosmic tapestry,
a reminder of the infinite,
you and I, merely fleeting flickers,
but the universe, abiding and eternal.

- Polia de Montalcini
