Oh! The hills, the hills! This dear path leads me,
In the delicate dusk of leafy trees.
Why pass so near the pools and the warm fields,
Under the wild glory of the sunsets' stains?
Oh sweet thought, the branding of my soul's desire!
Remains of summer ready to steal my heart,
Their dusky blare keeps drumming over the inky night,
And I love to listen to the quiet spring fears.

Those sweet scents of foliage remind me,
Of unsuspected ruins and endless sea,
Of the curvilinear route to a light far away.
Remember endlessly… the immaculate nature,
Oh! The hills, the hills! To the renewal of the soul,

- Arthur Rimbaud
