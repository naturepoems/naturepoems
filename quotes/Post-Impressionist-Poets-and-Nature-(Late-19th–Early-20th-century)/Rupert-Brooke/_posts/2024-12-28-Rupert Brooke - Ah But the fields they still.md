Ah! But the fields, they still remain,
Where silence walks with golden light,
Each blade of grass, in joy or pain,
Reveals the day, then yields to night.

With every sigh, a story flows,
With each caress of gentle dew;
And nature’s heart, eternal glows,
In peace that births the morning new.


- Rupert Brooke
