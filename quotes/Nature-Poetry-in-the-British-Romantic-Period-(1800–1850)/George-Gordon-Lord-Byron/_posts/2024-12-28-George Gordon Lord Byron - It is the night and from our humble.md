It is the night; and from our humble home
The spring is ushered in by breezes light;
The woodland glades are dappled with quick foam,
While fireflies dance, and the stars sleep in sight.

Like leaves of golden light each name, each line,
Each thought that lingers on the edge of fate,
Is captured in the whispers that entwine
With echoes in the silent, tangled state.

- George Gordon Lord Byron
