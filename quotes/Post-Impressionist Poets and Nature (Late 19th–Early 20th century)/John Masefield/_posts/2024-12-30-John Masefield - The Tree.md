The Tree

Trees, trees, who stand in the quiet ways,
Or lean in the gentle storm, you are the truth,
Your limbs, like arms, in surrender praise,
In wind's embrace, you hold the years' uncouth.

In winter's grip or summer’s snare,
Your leaves blush in the evening sun,
Calling us home with branches bare,
Together, lost, but finding one.

- John Masefield
