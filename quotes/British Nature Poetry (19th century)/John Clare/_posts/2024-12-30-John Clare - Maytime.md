The may is here, the hawthorn white,
   Clad in blossoms in the dell,
And in the morningâ€™s golden light,
   The ringdoves seem to love so well.

And every breeze that sweeps the grass,
   Comes fraught with fragrance from the trees,
The purest Air gives joy and peace,
   While flowers bloom and leaves congeal.

- John Clare
