But in vain the flame’s ensanguined wreath,
The whirlwinds rove in varying play,
Too late I cry in torturing breath,
Where are the winds that brought the day?
And from the woodlands, at my feet,
The flowers fall, like whispered sound,
That in evening’s calm retreat
Vanishes, returning to the ground.

-- Robert Southey, "The Fading Leaf"
