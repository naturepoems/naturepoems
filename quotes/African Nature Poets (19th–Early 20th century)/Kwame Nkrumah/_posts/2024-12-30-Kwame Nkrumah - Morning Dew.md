Morning Dew
Awakening softly, the dawn breaks anew,
Kissing the petals with morning dew.
Tiny beads glisten like stars on the ground,
In nature’s embrace, pure beauty is found.

With every sunrise, the world comes alive,
In the dance of the dew, the dreams start to thrive.
So delicate, precious, a moment so rare,
In the heart of each morning, pure magic fills the air.

- Kwame Nkrumah
