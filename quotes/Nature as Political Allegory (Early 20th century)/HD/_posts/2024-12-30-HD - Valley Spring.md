Wander a valley in spring,
Where the sky leans low, warms the spring muck,
And the sun graces the land with soft whispers,
Through trees many shadows unfurl golden leaves,
And watch the world turn slow into eternity.
Each bloom calls, every event moves forward,
To the music that yesterday sang, softly still.
