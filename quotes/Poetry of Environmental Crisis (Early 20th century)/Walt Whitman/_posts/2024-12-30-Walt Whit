Salut au Monde!

Salut au Monde!  
I see and hear the world in the dance of the great trees,  
In the light of the sun filtering through the leaves,  
In the music of the river that flows silently  
Through the valleys so deep, so serene.  
The colors of the earth radiate their beauty,  
In the flowers that bloom, in the songs that soar,  
In the embrace of the waves that kiss the shore,  
This is the joy of life, this is my heart's call,  
Salut au Monde! I celebrate us all.

- Walt Whitman
