The silver mist in morning glimmers,
  The dew drops cling to petals bright,
  As nature wakes from blissful slumber,
  Greeting day with pure delight.
  
  The trees are dressed in robes of emerald,
  The flowers flaunt their vibrant hue,
  And in the air, the sweet aroma
  Of life anew, the world renewed.

- Konstantin Balmont
