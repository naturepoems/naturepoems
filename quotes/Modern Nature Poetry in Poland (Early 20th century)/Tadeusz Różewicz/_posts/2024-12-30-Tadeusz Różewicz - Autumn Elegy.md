In the autumn of colors,
a shiver of gold,
a dance of crimson,
we gather the fallen leaves,
collect their whispers
and the scents of time
that withers and swoons.

Here is the solemnest hour,
where the sky meets earth
in a league of dusk
and everything waits
for the quiet breath
of winter’s embrace.


- Tadeusz Różewicz
