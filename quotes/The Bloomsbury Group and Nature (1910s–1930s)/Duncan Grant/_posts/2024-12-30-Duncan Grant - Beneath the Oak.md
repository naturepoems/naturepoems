Beneath the mighty oak's embrace,
In dappled light with shadows shy,
Dancing sunbeams weave and chase,
As time drifts softly passing by.

Roots stretch deep in mother earth,
While branches cradle heaven’s birth,
Nature’s heart beats steady, slow,
In whispered winds, her love will show.

- Duncan Grant
