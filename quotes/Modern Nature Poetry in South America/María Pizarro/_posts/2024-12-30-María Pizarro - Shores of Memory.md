Shores of Memory

Walking along the water’s edge,
where whispers dip into the tide,
a dance of echoes from the past,
a reminder of lives that touched these shores.

Each footprint carries a story,
a map of laughter, joy, and loss,
as the ocean hums its long refrain,
a melody resonating in my heart.

With every wave, I let go,
releasing what the sea will hold,
and in this merging of earth and water,
I find solace in the tides’ embrace.


- María Pizarro
