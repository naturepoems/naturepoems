A Woman's Love

To thee, my love, as moves the day,
My heart aches for thee the whole day long;
In the cool of the dawn, while the roses sway,
I see thee, my dream, in the light of the throng.

Oh! I touch the earth, yet I long for the stars,
And my soul would fly into Heaven’s dome;
In the summer’s glow, when the night-winds are far,
There I feel thy love, and I call thee home.

For ever beside me, through heartache and long,
Comes the whispers, of life’s bright blue sky;
And ever with gladness, where angels belong,
Wakes the love of my heart with a radiant sigh.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
