The Meadow

In the meadow,
  the wildflowers lean toward
  the gentle breeze,
it takes the chill out of evening,
  carries the scents of earth
  into the dusk.
We walk in wonder,
  wonder in a soft light,
everything breathing,
  as the moon climbs,
manifests the quiet into birds,
  into nothing; 
the sky shifts
  slowly above.

- A R Ammons
