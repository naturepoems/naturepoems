Correspondences

Forest of symbols, vast as a natural temple,
Where, in an eternal twilight, an obscure way
Wanders through the tangled trees,
As we hear a whispering, the sacred murmurs.

There scents wound with shades,
The far-off tremors of nature, woven with colors
As the vast labyrinth of gestures, slowly sounds
And where, at the edge, the mystery lies—

An unknown fragrance that rises, feathery,
The depth of night nestled with opulence,
Whole tribes will mingle above the mossy
Paths of truth—beautiful and melancholy.

All things here desire to speak, to possess
The ungraspable essences that fade away,
From which our souls draw the things of matter
As to render our lives all more sensual,
Bringing the eternal into the earthly realm.


- Charles Baudelaire
