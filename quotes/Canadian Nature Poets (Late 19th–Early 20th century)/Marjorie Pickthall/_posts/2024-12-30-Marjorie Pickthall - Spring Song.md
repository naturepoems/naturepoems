Spring Song

Bursts of color in the dawn,
Life awakens with golden skies,
From sleeping earth, the flowers yawn,
And nature dons her sweet disguise.

The brook sings soft a merry tune,
While birds their joyful notes impart,
In every petal, every rune,
Spring whispers hope into the heart.

- Marjorie Pickthall
