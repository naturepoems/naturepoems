Zenith

A peak fills the horizon —
      a soft rise in perfect symmetry —
while clouds shift around golden edges,
     a soft-hued cadence insinuates, 
         where the sun descends. 
With a shy heart, I reach the source,
   that breath of arc in skies that drown,
       in a moment caught between
            words unspoken, silence drawn.

- Lorine Niedecker
