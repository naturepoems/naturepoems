Pine Trees

In the depths of the forest,
Where the pines wear their needles like crowns,
A soft wind whispers of past years,
And the echoes of trees long fallen.

Each trunk stands like a sentinel,
Guarding secrets of the sun and rain,
While the undergrowth hums softly,
With the harmony of life unseen.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
