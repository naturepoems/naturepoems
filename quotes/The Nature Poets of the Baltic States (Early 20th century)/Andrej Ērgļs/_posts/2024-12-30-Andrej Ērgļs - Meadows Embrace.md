In the meadow where wildflowers bloom,  
Colors dance in joyous delight,  
A symphony of hues and scents,  
Beneath the warm and watchful light.

Bees flutter from petal to petal,  
Gathering sweetness, fat and pleased,  
While butterflies with gentle grace,  
Float on zephyrs, never ceased.

The wind whispers among the blades,  
A lullaby both calm and kind,  
Nature’s breath, a tender hug,  
In the embrace of earth, we find.

- Andrej Ērgļs
