The Garden

I lived in a great city,
  And I was very busy,
  And I had many things to do. 
And I had many thoughts.
I felt the air was thin, and glittering
  A thousand people were to me, and I could not dream
Who would answer a question for me. —
But oh, how glad I am to have come
  To this home — wishing it were a thousand lilies!

- Edna St Vincent Millay
