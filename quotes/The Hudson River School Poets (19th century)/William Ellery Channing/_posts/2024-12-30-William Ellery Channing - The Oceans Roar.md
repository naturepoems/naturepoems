The ocean roars, wise and old,  
Crashing waves on sands of time,  
In its depths, all secrets fold,  
In siren songs, both wild and prime.  

With every swell, a tale unfolds,  
Of distant lands and skies above,  
In waters calm or tempest bold,  
The eternal dance of life and love.

- William Ellery Channing
