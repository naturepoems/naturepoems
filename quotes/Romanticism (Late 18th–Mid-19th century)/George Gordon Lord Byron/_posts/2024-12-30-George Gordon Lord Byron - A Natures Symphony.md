The cypress, mourning ‘neath the willow’s shade,  
Weaves its branch enchanted like a maid;  
In marine wonder meets the autumn glow,  
Where peaceful scenes of rivers casually flow.  
 
The hills respond like gentle waves at sea,  
The sylvan ghosts in shadows dance with glee;  
Thus time creeps lightly, ne’er aware of haste—  
A quality in Nature, woven deeply chaste.

- George Gordon Lord Byron
