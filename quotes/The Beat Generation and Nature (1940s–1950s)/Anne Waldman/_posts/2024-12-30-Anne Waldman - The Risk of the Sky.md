The Risk of the Sky
climbing beyond constraints,
looking up at the vast gaps,
at every push and pull, we ride the wind,
freedom aside, it beats through branches,
leaving traces of an adventure.

the embrace of sunlight,
a seraphic fire, brings strength,
we spiral into circles,
finding experiences within the air,
touched by every gust,
a kiss beside the clouds,
reminding us of that infinite reach,
every heartbeat close, every moment risked.
