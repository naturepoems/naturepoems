To Nature

O Love! O Life!  
    O Death!  
     O Hope!  
      O Fear!  
       O Life!  
        O Love!
          Nature are we thine?

I must behold for longer, finer, clearer,  
    Leafy garden, tree, and flower;  
   Broader pools, and sunlit way;  
Oh urge the spirit of the sun,  
As his heart’s golden vision,  
Thro’ his portion of the land!  
Dare abide through wanderings of the sea!


- Matthew Arnold
