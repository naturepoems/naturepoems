The forest deep, where secrets lie,  
Holds echoes of forgotten dreams,  
The sunlight filters through the leaves,  
And nature's beauty softly gleams.
  
In every rustle, every hush,  
A melody of life resounds,  
Call forth the spirit, feel the rush,  
Where harmony in silence abounds.


- Friedrich Hölderlin
