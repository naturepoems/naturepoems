The tide rises, the tide falls,  
The twilight darkens, the sky burns red,  
The wind that wafts the boat away  
Is a spirit of life that brings the dead.  
  
The tide rises, the tide falls,  
The dark, cold shore is a land of dreams,  
Where the moon spills silver on the sea,  
And the waves pulse softly, like deep, dark themes.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
