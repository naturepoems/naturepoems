I see a new world
By the brook side,
A gentle creature,
By nature chide,
Can I abide this peace,
As night then falls,
The quiet rivers,
Sing soft, sweet calls.

In the wildness there,
When autumn hues,
Turn tender grasses,
Into drunken views,
Let me stay as a lover,
Thin shadows roam,
In this peaceful kingdom,
Where I find home.

- Henry David Thoreau
