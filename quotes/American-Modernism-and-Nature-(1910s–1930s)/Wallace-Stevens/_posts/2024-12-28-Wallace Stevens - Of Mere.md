Of Mere Being
The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space.

The palm stands on the edge of space.
The palm stands on the edge of space.

- Wallace Stevens
