The Quiet Sea
The quiet sea, a gentle friend,
Reflects the heavens vast and near,
With whispers soft that never end,
A melody, both calm and clear.
Each ripple tells a tale of grace,
As tides embrace the sandy shore,
In this sanctuary, my heart finds place,
Forever yearning for the ocean's lore.



- Julian Grenfell
