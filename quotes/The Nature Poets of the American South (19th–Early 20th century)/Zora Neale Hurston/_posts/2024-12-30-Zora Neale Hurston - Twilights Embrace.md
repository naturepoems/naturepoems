When twilight beckons, shadows long,
The crickets share their evening song.
The world slows down with every sigh,
Nature's breath as soft as a lullaby.

With every star, a wish to send,
In the quiet calm, my heart shall mend.
Here in the dusk's gentle sigh,
I find my peace, and time stands by.


- Zora Neale Hurston
