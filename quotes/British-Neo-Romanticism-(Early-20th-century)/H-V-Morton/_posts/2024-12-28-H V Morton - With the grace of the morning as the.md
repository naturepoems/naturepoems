With the grace of the morning, as the sun breaks anew,
In the arms of the land, feel the world start to bloom.
The canvas of colors, in a dance of delight,
Whisper secrets of nature, painting day into night.

The meadows adorned with their gowns of fine gold,
In the laughter of daisies, their stories unfold.
With the promise of rain, the earth glistens bright,
In the symphony playing, we bask in the light.

The mountains, long-standing, like sentinels tall,
With their majesty whispering, urging us all.
To embrace every moment, the wild and the free,
For the land is a mirror of what we can be.

So treasure each heartbeat, as nature’s own call,
In the rhythm of living, we’re part of it all.
For in each fleeting moment, let your spirit ignite,
And weave through the wonders that whisper goodnight.

- H V Morton
