The Call of the Wild
wildness hovers,
fluttering wings on bounce,
it is in the sun’s shadow—
climbing tree limbs, chasing flickers,
all grass turned toward joy,
a melody spirals inside each root,
taking its claim.

those silent cracks become
lines of resistance,
no regrets plucked from the air,
just the heart’s echo,
the pulse of the wild in all of its forms,
flowers extending hands reaching toward
that deep hum of dusk.
