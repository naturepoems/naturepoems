quote: "The moon is a sickle in the sky,  
Cutting through the woven fabric of night,  
While shadows slide like whispers across the grass.  
A dew-dropped spider spins its delicate map,  
Navigating the world with thin crystal threads."

The moon is a sickle in the sky,  
Cutting through the woven fabric of night,  
While shadows slide like whispers across the grass.  
A dew-dropped spider spins its delicate map,  
Navigating the world with thin crystal threads.
