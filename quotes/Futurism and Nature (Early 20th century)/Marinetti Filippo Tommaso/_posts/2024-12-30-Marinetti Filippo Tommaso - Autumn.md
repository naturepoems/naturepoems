Autumn  
Autumn, dissolve your dry leaves,  
let them become dust of dreams,  
for in their decay  
I find my potency!  

Let the skies darken,  
and as shadows grow thick  
I shall write, your clouds  
spooling a golden abyss,  
in your embered winds,  
it shall stir my heart!

Oh the gentle kiss  
of nature on my mind  
and the soul of concrete Iâ€™ve fashioned!  
Every dusk shall plume  
with colors of behavior,  
every inhale a revolting victory,

for the beauty of the dying  
is an eternal reminiscence!

- Marinetti Filippo Tommaso
