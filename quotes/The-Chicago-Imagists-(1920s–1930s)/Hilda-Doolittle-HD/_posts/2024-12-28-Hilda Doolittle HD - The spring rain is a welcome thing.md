The spring rain is a welcome thing  
      It washes the dust from the trees  
And the child in the yard  
      Who has waited for it  
That he might plunge his hand  
      Into the blue and white water  
Is not quite so lonely  
      As he was before.  

The air is filled with flowers  
      And the touch of the dew  
Is heartening and strong  
      And the scent of the wood  
Is a breath taken  
      And given back to the wind.
