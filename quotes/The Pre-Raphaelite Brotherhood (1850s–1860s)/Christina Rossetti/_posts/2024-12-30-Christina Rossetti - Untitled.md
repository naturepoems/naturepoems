Untitled
There is no light, no moon, nor star,
Yet I can feel your breath so near:
The shadowed trees are beckoning,
Bold size to hide my heart with fear.

Which is the way my spirit flows,
Into the river deep and wide,
I know not where your presence goes,
Where time and shadows also bide.

- Christina Rossetti
