Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird

I
Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.

II
I lined the blackbird up with the sky
And when the blackbird flew in the sunlight.

III
The blackbird whistled
To the glacier of the mountain that’s
The land and water.

IV
I saw a blackbird
In the air against the green of the trees.

V
How the blackbird sings
Through the night alone,
And how it calls the world.

VI
I heard it from the earth grown hollow.
The water moved, below, leaving nothing.

VII
Between the mountains and the valley’s curve
There was the lust against the cold, sung above;

VIII
And where the crags were thunderous
There is a sudden joy
In that blackbird’s song.

IX
The noise between the trees
And even under the stone, all grew
Where the blackbird sat; the song is over.

X
And every snow is on the ground; and alone,
It leaves each creature strangled in its meaning.

XI
This song and that mine shape are growing round
So that between the breezes—this must be known.

XII
I am too late in nature’s arms:
I am almost lost; I fly with the blackbird.

XIII
Sometimes, it seems, she dreams,
And from that merging brings her own dark wings.
