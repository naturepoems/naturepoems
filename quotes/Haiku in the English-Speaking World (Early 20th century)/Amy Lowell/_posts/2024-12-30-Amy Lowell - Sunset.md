Sunset

The sun has pointed the ends  
Of its heavy fingers on the walls,
It sets the tired trees on fire  
And like a huge brass bell  
The sound echoes through the leaves.  

They hang still, drooping down  
With a silence that is almost holy,  
Nothing can pass here now,  
Not even the loss of the day  
As it fades like a pale yellow  
Disguise against the horizon.

- Amy Lowell
