The Mountains

In the mountains high, where the eagles soar,
  The golden sun plays on the peaks of snow;
Where the valleys dip, and the rivers roar,
  And the heart feels free in the winds that blow.

Touch me with your cool hands of the night,
  And wrap me in wild, eternal dreams:
For the mountains sing sweetly of love and light,
  And laughter that dances in cool moonbeams.

- Isabella Valancy Crawford
