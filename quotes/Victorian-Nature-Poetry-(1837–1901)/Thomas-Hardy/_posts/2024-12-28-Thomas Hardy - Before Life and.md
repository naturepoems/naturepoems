Before Life and After
When the eyes that are warm in the spring,
Were wholly lost on that tranquil night,\nWhen stars were strewn through the skies a-ting,
Fell reflections wrapped up in golden gleams,\nFrom hearts that faded along the way—
Life lost all in the rushing light—
Of daylight the gracious rays did call

- Thomas Hardy
