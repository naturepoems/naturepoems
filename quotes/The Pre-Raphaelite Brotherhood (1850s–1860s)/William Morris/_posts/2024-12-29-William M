To a Flower

O blooming flower so dear to my heart,
In your petals, the sun does adore,
With your fragrance, the world does impart,
A whisper that resonates evermore.

In gardens whispered secrets of love,
With colors that paint the vast sky,
You remind us of all from above,
In the beauty that never says goodbye.


- William Morris
