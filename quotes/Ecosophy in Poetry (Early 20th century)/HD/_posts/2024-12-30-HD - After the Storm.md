After the Storm

   or the heavy drop,
   pallor of the sky,  
   —so heavy,
   with moonlilies,
   white as the white,
   with their night bloom,

   I open the embrace of a fern,
   —that flower, with all of earth,
   —so sweet, yielding, so pushed to softness.
   I kiss the heavy blossom,
   I touch their curl —
   as they wave,
   the sky murmurs, rushing against me!
