The Plains

Rolling out, the plains stretch wide,
A book unfolding in sunlight,
Words etched upon the solid ground,
Winding steams wrap their arms around the stones.

Itâ€™s here my breath catches with them,
Echo wandering through amber grace,
Mimicking the sigh of clouds pouring silence,
Beneath the weight of the summer sun.

Grass bends low, opening sharp green bursts,
Where the breeze dances and finds its voice,
As if each stalk remembers the song of rain
Which echoed from these lands long ago.

And my feet tread lightly, with a love unknown,
Singing softly to the soft swell of grass,
Where every step becomes a quiet prayer,
As I join the harmony of the vast expanse.

- James Wright  

This poem emphasizes the serenity and grandeur of the plains, reflecting on the deep connections between a person and the natural world.
