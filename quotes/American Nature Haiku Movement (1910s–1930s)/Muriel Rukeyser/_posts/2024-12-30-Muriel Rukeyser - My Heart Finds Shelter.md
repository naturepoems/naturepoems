My heart finds shelter in the woods,
in corners smoothed by silence.
We circle time and splash
quietly through the undergrowth—
   it reveals a temple of roots
    and limbs that bridge the moments.

Midday light's fingertips, sprawling—
     a stretch of sunshine filtering,
gathering warmth under canopies,
we ask the flower's means beneath 
the busy hum of bees,
    each drop of nectar earned.

The earth embraces fears, unveiling
      a beat of laughter unspooled,
    gathering with each step through 
a waltz of fluttering wings, 
gathered against the tender strokes
of winding vines across our feet.

- Muriel Rukeyser
