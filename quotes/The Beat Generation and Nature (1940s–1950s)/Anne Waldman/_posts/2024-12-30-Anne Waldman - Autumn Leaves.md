Autumn Leaves
one by one the autumn leaves,
flame tongues touching earth's marble,
fading backpacks loaded with memory,
just the whisper of what’s left behind.

there’s a song in the decay,
a forgiveness in the crinkled edges,
it carries the weight of the old
between gaps of laughter and pain,
aching in the tone of farewell.

the ground gathers spirits,
a place to rest, 
its rich smells adding to the history,
a golden pile of days,
a simple recognition,
yet this is the heart of life,
directions expanded within.

Anne Waldman
