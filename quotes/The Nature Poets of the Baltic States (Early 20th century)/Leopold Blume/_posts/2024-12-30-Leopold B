Morning Dew
The morning dew glistens on the grass,
Like diamonds cast in gentle dawn,
Each droplet creates a momentâ€™s pass,
As the sun rises, and shadows yawn.

Nature wakes in hues of gold,
As light pours in, a sweet caress,
In every ray, a promise told,
That this day brings, life to bless.

With every breath of crisp, fresh air,
Our spirits lift, our hearts align,
In the dance of morning's tender care,
We find our place, our souls entwined.

- Leopold Blume
