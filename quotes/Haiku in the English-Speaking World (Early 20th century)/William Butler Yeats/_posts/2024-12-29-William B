The Rose of the World
Come, hear the drum that gives its call,
Burning across the earthly lands,
And as the light lays low on all
We shall dance in the evening stands,

But on the edge of each thought's breathing
The drumming echoes faint as crew,
As somewhere must, by every being,
This new brightness come to view.

- William Butler Yeats
