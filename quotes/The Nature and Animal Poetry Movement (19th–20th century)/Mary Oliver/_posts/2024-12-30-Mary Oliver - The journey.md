The journey

One day you finally knew
what you had to do, and began,
though the voices around you
kept shouting
their bad advice—
though the whole house
began to tremble
and you felt the old tug
at your ankles.
“Mend the rift,”
“Fill the spaces,”
“Get yourself back to where you belong.”
Though you shook with loss
and you kept on asking,
as you stood at the corner, 
“Why did you leave?
What was wrong with me?” 

But it was too late.
You kept on walking,
your knees weak from taking every step 
from the heart.
You walked toward the sky.
If you had cried, would it have made it any better?
But, no, you didn’t cry, you were lost in it,
rendered with time.

And this is the journey—
year after year,
into the better
wherever it may lead.
Down through the rocks
and to the wide sea.

You don’t know where the journey takes you,
you just know you have to be on your way.
You just know it is time.

- Mary Oliver
