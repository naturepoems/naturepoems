When the storm clouds gather,
and thunder rolls like a wild drum,
wrapping the world with tension,
yet in every bolt and flash,
the raw might of nature,
it exclaims life, alive,
to the pulse of the universe,
a reminder of chaos’ beauty,
in every raging tempest, –
camaraderie with the wild.

- Margherita Sarfatti
