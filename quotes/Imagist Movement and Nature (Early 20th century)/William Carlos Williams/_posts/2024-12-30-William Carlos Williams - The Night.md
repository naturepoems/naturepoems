The Night

Is a friend

and still all alone.

The flowers of the night

hold their bodies

like silks on a woman.

Tonight

I would simply roam,

and up the hills

and live on the lights

that strung in the sky.

How soft the night feels,

open and fragrant.

And in tune with the harps

of the evening air,

a small breeze
dragging fresh stories home.

- William Carlos Williams
