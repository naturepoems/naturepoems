Nature’s Heart
There’s a pulse within the forest wild,
a rhythm weaves through each tree and glade,
it breathes and sighs, like a newborn child,
a sacred bond that shall never fade.

In whispers soft, the leaves converse,
a language rich beyond all perception,
with every rustle and gentle verse,
it holds the world in sweet connection.

As I wander through this verdant breath,
I feel the heartbeat of the earth,
for in its depths, there lies no death,
but life anew, rebirth’s own mirth.


- Thomas S P S Munch
