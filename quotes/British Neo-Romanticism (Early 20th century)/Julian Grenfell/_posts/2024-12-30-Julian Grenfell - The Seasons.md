The Seasons
Each season brings its heart anew,
From spring’s soft bloom to winter’s chill,
In every leaf, the sky, the dew,
The magic lives, invincible will.
In summer’s heat, the laughter rings,
While autumn dons her golden crown,
Nature dances, thus she sings,
An eternal cycle, never down.



- Julian Grenfell
