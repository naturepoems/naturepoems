I have wandered through the fields,
And watched the gentle rise,
Of fragrant blooms beneath the shields,
Of summer's restful skies.

The hedgerows teem with life anew,
While dappled shadows play,
In every hue a lovely view,
That lingers through the day.

From mornings bright to dusky light,
In nature’s sweet embrace,
I find a joy—my heart takes flight,
For here I find my place.

- William Wordsworth
