A Forest To The Sea

Lo! the shadows stacking up upon the glade,
Where the woodland reapers sing their lullabies,
Wave by wave they flicker and fade
In the dream of azure between the trees,
Not a footstep falls, nor any chime
On the drowsy whispers through the leafy dome—
So like a quiet time in sleepy rhyme
Fades my heart, drifted down the home
Of sail and sea, and the tangled vines,
Lapping at thy shores with love-struck wine.
That beauty beckons sweet, as waves arise,
To tell of treasures lying in the brine,
While the sheer cliffs echo the songs divine.
