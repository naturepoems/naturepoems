The stars alight in velvet skies,  
Each twinkle a wish from long ago,  
Where the cosmos meets the dreaming eyes,  
In a tapestry of light’s warm glow.

Mountains echo the ancient songs,  
Of a world beyond our sight,  
In the silence where the spirit belongs,  
And the heart takes flight into the night.

With every breath, the universe speaks,  
In rhythms of the galactic dance,  
Nature’s voice, the soul seeks,  
In the embrace of this cosmic romance.

- Andrej Ērgļs
