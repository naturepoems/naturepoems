The sun lowers itself
into the rim of the horizon,
a gentle kiss to earth,
a promise of return,
is the world bruised,
or are the colors
merely spilling from the heavens?

I hold my breath,
fearful that they might disappear,
for in these moments
beauty rests,
a paradox held on the cusp of night.
Nature teaches us to hold parables of light,
to capture moments fleeting,
to cherish the end as we cherish the beginnings.

- Nadine Gordimer
