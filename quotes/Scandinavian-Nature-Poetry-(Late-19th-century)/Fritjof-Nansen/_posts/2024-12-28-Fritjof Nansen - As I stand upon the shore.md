As I stand upon the shore,  
Waves kiss the land,  
And the sun dips low,  
A molten ember in the sky,  
Its reflections dance like fire  
On the face of the deep.

The gulls call out,  
Graceful in their flight,  
A reminder of freedom  
In the vastness of the sea,  
While the tides pull back,  
Whispering secrets  
Of the depths and the journey  
That lies beneath.

Here, in this moment,  
Time is both endless and fleeting,  
And I am but a breath  
In this eternal cycle,  
Finding solace in the rhythm  
Of the waves, the wind,  
The song of the horizon.

- Fritjof Nansen
