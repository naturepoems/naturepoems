There was a child went forth every day;  
And the first object he looked upon, that object he became;  
And that object became a part of him,  
For the day that’s gone is perfect for the ones that follow—  
He looked upon the trees and flowers,  
And they became a part of him,  
As did the endless birds in every green-tipped field.  
And the winds, and the waters,  
They flowed into his soul,  
And his heart beat with the rhythm of the fields beneath.

- Walt Whitman
