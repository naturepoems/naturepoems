title: "Marianne Moore - The SeaITrusting  To give all  To bring the icicle winds  To churn with dark  Bespeaking you drenched  Your power like a vow  What starlight falls upon  On whom I opt to choose  All in fire flowing withinIIYet clearer than birdsong  A soft lay flow of sand  Transferring every grains life  Yellow crisp with concerns  For each still night falls  If bubbles churn still dark  Sustenance the sea will stir"
