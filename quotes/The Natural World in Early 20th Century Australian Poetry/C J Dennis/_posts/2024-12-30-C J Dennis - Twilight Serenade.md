The sunset spreads out with a golden array,
And the day bows its head, like a serene ballet.
Flowers hold up their faces, bathed in tinted light,
While the breezes sweep softly with a whisper of night.

The earth wears her jewels, and the stars are her crown,
As she twirls through the silence, with her beauties unbound,
O come, ye bright spirits, to this sweet twilight scene,
For the world’s at its best when the day’s in between.


- C J Dennis
