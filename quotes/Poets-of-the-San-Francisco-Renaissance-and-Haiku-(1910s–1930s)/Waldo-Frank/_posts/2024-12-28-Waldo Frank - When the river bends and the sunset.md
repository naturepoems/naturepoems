  The spirit of twilight gracefully flows. 
  Through the valley, a soft breeze does sweep, 
  Lullabies sung as the world drifts to sleep."

When the river bends and the sunset glows, 
  The spirit of twilight gracefully flows. 
  Through the valley, a soft breeze does sweep, 
  Lullabies sung as the world drifts to sleep.
