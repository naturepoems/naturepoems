Within the heart of every glade,
   There flows a gentle breath of peace;
The very shadows seem to wade,
   Where light and quiet never cease.

I sit beneath the ancient trees,
   Their secrets told in rustling leaves;
With every sigh, my spirit frees,
   In Nature's arms, my heart believes.

- Adelaide Anne Procter
