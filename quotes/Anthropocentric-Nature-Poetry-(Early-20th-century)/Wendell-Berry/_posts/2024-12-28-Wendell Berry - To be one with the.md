To be one with the earth
   is an invitation,
   a calling that is louder
   than all our distractions.
The hills roll before us,
   ancient layers of life
   tell stories with every shadow.

   The rivers sing their way
   through valleys, crossing
   paths of forgetfulness,
   while the skies change in secret
   as they iterate and revel
   in the hues of dawn and dusk.

   I hear the places where
   the soft rain touches down,
   the thick calls of the blue jay,
   and I know:
   there is nothing more sacred
   than the simple engagement of being here.


- Wendell Berry
