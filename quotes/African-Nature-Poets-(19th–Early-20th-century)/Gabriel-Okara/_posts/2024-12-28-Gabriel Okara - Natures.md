Nature’s Symphony
In the dawn light, nature wakes,
A symphony of sounds collide,
Birds chirp their morning praise,
While rustling leaves join in the ride.

Water babbles, smooth and low,
A serenade for hearts that roam,
Every element in harmony,
A chorus leading us back home.

With each note, the world reveals,
The beauty that each moment yields,
In nature’s arms, I lose my fears,
As life unfolds through whispered cheers.

- Gabriel Okara
