Morning Dew
Crystal drops on blades of grass,
Natureâ€™s gems, they sparkle, pass.
In the dawn, they softly gleam,
A fleeting moment, a waking dream.

Whispers of the night give way,
To light that breaks the dawn of day,
In each droplet, life revived,
In morning dew, the world contrived.


- Antonio SantElia
