A Dream of Death

I will reach you beneath the sun,
Where trees breathe soft with dreams divine,
And carry the hopes of those who live,
To spring forth in colors fine.

Yet the past will end in death,
Through winding paths, we meet in dreams;
Though time may bend its heavy breath,
Hope through the shadows gleams.

- William Butler Yeats
