Morning’s Greet
With dawn, the world awakens slow,
Birds chirp their gentle refrain,
The sun begins its golden show,
A symphony in light and grain.

Each blade of grass, each blooming flower,
Drinks in the warmth of day’s embrace,
In nature’s arms, we taste the hour,
In every sunrise, find our place.

- Aldona Gustava
