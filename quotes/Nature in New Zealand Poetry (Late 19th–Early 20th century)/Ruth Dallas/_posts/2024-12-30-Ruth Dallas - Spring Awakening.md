The blossoms bloom in their festive attire,  
With colors splashed on the canvas of spring;  
In the dance of petals, my heart takes fire,  
As nature awakens, rejoicing to sing.  

The butterflies flutter, a delicate trace,  
And the bees hum their tunes in the fragrant air;  
In this blossoming world, I find my place,  
And my spirit fills with love and care.

- Ruth Dallas
