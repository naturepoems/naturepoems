In the hush of the evening, the shadows wake,
And spread over valleys wide,
In the twilight hours, the soft winds shake
The branches where dreams abide.

For nature holds her secrets tight,
In whispered tones anew,
And cradles the heart within her light,
As the stars peek through.

So, come with me to the place of grace,
Where beauty reigns supreme;
In the evening glow, we can find our space,
And whisper the sweetest dream.


- Paul Laurence Dunbar
