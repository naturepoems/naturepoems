The Buried Life

Light flows our war of mocking words;  
But wilt thou have?  
The heart of the evil is shut up like a tomb,
And the heart of birds flies where the tree blooms.

But wherefore,  
Ah! wherefore would we do this?
The air is cold, and the sun through music flows;  
Heaven is in this five-sided square!
Yahoo, ye summer sun stops here!


- Matthew Arnold
