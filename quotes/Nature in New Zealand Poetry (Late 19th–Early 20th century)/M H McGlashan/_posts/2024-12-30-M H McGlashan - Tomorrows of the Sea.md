Tomorrows of the Sea

Tomorrow, as the dawn awakes,
  The sea will stretch and stree,
To cradle dreams upon its wakes,
  While waves rush back to free.

And every gull that deftly glides,
  With elegance and pride,
Will carry whispers from the tides,
  Inviting hearts to ride.

The golden sun will crown the blue,
  A regal, warming glance;
The ocean holds a world anew,
  It beckons us to dance.

For every wave brings life anew,
  Each crest a voice of song;
And in this vast, embracing view,
  Our hearts will right the wrong.

So let us wade into this sea,
  With faith and dreams so bold; 
Tomorrow’s gift will set us free,
  In treasures yet untold.
