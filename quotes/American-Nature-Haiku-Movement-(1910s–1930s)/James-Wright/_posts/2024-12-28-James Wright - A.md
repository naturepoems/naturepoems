A Blessing
Just off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,
Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass.
And the eyes of those two Indian ponies
Darken with kindness. Inside the church,  
The grandfather  
Teaches the grandson  
To see the sunset as a promise.  
As a blessing instead of as a closing.  
The grandfather does not need to explain  
How loneliness looks like the stone not put down.
in the sudden call of the evening winds.

It is beautiful,
An old man on the ground,  
And the granddaughter still asleep,
Whispering,  
"Lord, I will not be the last to see the  
Setting sun."  

The old man kneels beside the ponies,  
And he speaks as much as he sees.  
He speaks the blessing:  
The few who are left to behold the truth,  
Longing as he breathes it.
