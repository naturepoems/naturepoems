The Sun Rises
A flash of flame, the sun ignites,
Piercing the veil of morning's mist,
Emerges from the arms of night,
A shock to life, it can't resist.

Golden rays dance with the breeze,
Kissing the leaves upon the trees,
In this moment, all feels right,
Nature's breath, the morning light.


- Antonio SantElia
