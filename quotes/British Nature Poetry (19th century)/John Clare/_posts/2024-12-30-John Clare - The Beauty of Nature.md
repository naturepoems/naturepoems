The wild flowers blow in the meadow fair,
   The rippling brook sings sweet and low,
And the sunbeams sparkle on every hair
   Of the free-born horse that roams so slow.

The larks sing loud in the open air,
   The robins chirp from the bordering trees,
The warm winds sigh with a fragrant care,
   And the world is bright with blooming peace.

- John Clare
