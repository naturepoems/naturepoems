The Springtime Beckons  
The blush of morning light  
Gently unfolds  
Over the hills,  
And the air dances,  
Tickling the petals  
Of awakening trees,  
Petals that pop  
Like laughter through woods.  

Alive in the moment,  
The grasses shimmer  
With every sigh of the wind,  
The bees hum humbly  
In their making,  
And the heart of the earth  
Blooms wide with a chorus.  

As the springtime beckons,  
Voices of the thrushes  
Climb through the branches,  
Chasing shadows of winter  
To the cut of the day,  
Where hope spills freely  
In arcs of color and life.

- David Gascoyne
