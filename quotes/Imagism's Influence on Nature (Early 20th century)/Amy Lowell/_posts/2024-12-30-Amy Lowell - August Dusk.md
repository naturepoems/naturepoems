The trees break off into blue,
And earth is but a shadow, blue,
Beneath the low-hanging clouds, grey,
Where the sun is still in the bay,
A fragment, a remnant, a spark.
I wish to dance in the softness,
Of your August dusk,
Where cicadas sing their knowledge,
And the small stars steal into sight.
The moon, a silver whisper,
Marks the passage of night.

- Amy Lowell
