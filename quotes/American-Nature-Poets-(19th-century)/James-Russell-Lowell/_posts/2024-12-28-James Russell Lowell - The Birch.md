The Birch Tree
The birch tree stands in purest white,
   Its leaves a tender green,
   The moonbeams take their subtle flight,
   And paint each leaf a sheen.

   O gentle sighs of evening breeze,
   That softly kiss the grass!
   In Nature's choir my heart finds ease,
   Beneath the birch tree's mass.


- James Russell Lowell
