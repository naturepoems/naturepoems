The autumn leaves, a fiery dance,
In shades of red and gold they fly,
Each gust a fleeting, wild romance,
That twirls beneath the amber sky.

As nature whispers soft goodbyes,
To summer's warmth, to sunlit days,
In each descent, a heart that sighs,
For in this change, a beauty plays.

- Gerhard Gran
