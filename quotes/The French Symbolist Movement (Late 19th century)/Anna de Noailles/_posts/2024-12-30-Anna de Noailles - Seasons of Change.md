Each season tells a story of its own,
Spring's laughter blooms, summerâ€™s warm embrace;
Autumn whispers secrets in falling leaves,
Winter sings softly with a blanket of peace.

In this cycle, we learn to let go,
To hold dear what time cannot reclaim;
The earth spins on, wrapped in her silence,
A tender promise that nothing is ever lost.

- Anna de Noailles
