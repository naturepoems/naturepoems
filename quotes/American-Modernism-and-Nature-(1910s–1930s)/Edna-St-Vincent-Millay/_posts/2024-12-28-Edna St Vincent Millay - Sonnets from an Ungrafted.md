Sonnets from an Ungrafted Tree

Today as I walk the meadow wide, 
    I cannot know why forms of leaves appear,
Nor why the winds touch every leaf with pride, 
    And my thoughts are nowhere but to steer. 
Where are you going?  What are you bringing?  
    I linger with flowers, and not a sound,
For nothing is still and gains the singing; 
    There’s breaking calm for the wild reeds’ round.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
