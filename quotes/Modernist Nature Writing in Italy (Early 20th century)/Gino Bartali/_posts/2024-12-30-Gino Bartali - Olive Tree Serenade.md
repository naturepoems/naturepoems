Under the vast sky,  
the olive trees sway,  
a tapestry of silver,  
as the wind whispers secrets,  
ancient tales of the land.  
Beneath the azure dome,  
fingers of sunlight stretch,  
caressing the earth,  
a warm embrace of life.  

The horizon beckons,  
a promise of journeys,  
each step a story,  
a connection to nature,  
a bond unbroken through time.

- Gino Bartali
