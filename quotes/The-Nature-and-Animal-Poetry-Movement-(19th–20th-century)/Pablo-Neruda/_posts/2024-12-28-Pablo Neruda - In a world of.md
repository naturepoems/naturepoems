In a world of water,
yonder lies a brimming
lake, it bows to receive
the contour of the land.
And sometimes the sky
becomes a marvelous vase,
that pours softly downward,
infusing shade for the trees.
Each tinier drop a thought,
each ripple a word,
a language written by wading birds.
Everywhere is wetness
to ornament the green,
and I feel it whisper
a gentle song of the unseen.
