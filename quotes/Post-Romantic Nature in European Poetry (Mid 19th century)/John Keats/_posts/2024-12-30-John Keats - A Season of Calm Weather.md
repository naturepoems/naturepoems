A Season of Calm Weather

This calm, and quiet evening of the fall
Renews my soul with thoughts that I can prize.
The driving clouds alone begin to stall
In patches midst the blue of autumn skies.

The sun sinks low, it gilds the trees with gold,
And little birds, in quietness have ceased;
The universe grows bright with shades they hold
As lingering twilight glows, and we are blessed.

â€” A Season of Calm Weather

- John Keats
