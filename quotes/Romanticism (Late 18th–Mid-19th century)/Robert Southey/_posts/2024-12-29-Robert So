The Moonlit Night

The night falls gently, soft and kind,
The moon, a lantern in the blind.
In silver stream, it washes o'er,
The treetops whisper of yestore.

The stars twinkle, in soft embrace,
While shadows creep, they lace this place.
In darkness, hearts begin to wade,
In glowing peace, no fears invade.

O nocturnal song, thou art divine,
In thine allure, I can’t resign.
For in this night where calm is found,
A voice of nature speaks profound.

- Robert Southey
