I heard the bells on Christmas Day  
Their old, familiar carols play,  
And wild and sweet the words repeat,  
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men!  
  
Yet many hear the voices call,  
Above the tumult and the strife,  
And so we gather 'round to sing  
A hymn of nature—fresh with life.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
