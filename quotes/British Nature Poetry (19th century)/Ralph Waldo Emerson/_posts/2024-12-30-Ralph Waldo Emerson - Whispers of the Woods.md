The forest deep, where shadows dwell,
Bears secrets that it will not tell;
In every tree, a story lives,
In every rustle, nature gives.

The echoes of the deer that pass,
The quickening steps on the cool, soft grass;
In stillness, life reveals its heart,
In silent woods, we find our part.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
