Let the earth now with laughter ring,  
For I hear the larks, their songs divine,  
In every creature's hidden wing  
I trace the paths of love entwined.

The dew upon the grass does gleam,  
While nature yawns in dawn's embrace,  
I lose myself in this perfect dream,  
In lifeâ€™s rich, vibrant, tender grace.
