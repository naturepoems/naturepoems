The Garden

I
  In every flower's bloom, a tale,
     Of love and loss in soft detail,
     Among the roses threaded, twine
     The dreams of ages so divine.

II
  Green leaves sway like music's breath,
     A pause between the life and death;
     My heart doth linger 'midst the vinesâ€”
     In every garden, nature shines.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
