author: Ezra Pound
quote: "The fountains mingle with the river
And the rivers with the Ocean;
The winds of Heaven mix forever
With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single;
All things by a law divine
In one spirit meet and mingle.
Why not I with thine?"

The fountains mingle with the river
And the rivers with the Ocean;
The winds of Heaven mix forever
With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single;
All things by a law divine
In one spirit meet and mingle.
Why not I with thine?
