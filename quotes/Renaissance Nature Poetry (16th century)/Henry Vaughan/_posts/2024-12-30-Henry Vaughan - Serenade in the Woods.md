The silent woods, with whispers deep,  
Share secrets of a world untouched;  
In twilight's calm, I softly creep  
Through ancient groves, by darkness clutched.

Each branch a quivering heart, it seems,  
As if they share in natureâ€™s dream;  
In beauty's pause, the soul redeems  
A sense of wonder, a quiet beam.
