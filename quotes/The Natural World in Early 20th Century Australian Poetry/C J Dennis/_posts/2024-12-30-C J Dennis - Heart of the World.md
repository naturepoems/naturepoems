There’s a place in the heart of the world’s gentle grace,
Where the wanderer finds that they’ve truly a place;
In the arms of the mountains, the rivers, the trees,
Where the echoes of nature wander soft on the breeze.

And the days spin their stories, as the seasons renew,
In the moments of wonder, we are all born anew;
For the magic of landscapes, and the wildness of dreams,
Are the gifts of the Earth, through her shimmering seams.


- C J Dennis
