The Figure a Poem Makes

A poem begins in delight
And ends in wisdom.
Itâ€™s with the figure of the sky
That makes every point of trouble,

Starry night wrangle after rapids,
And each the other is advancing
Over eider and foliage.
Bringing back a time scarce over and oh!

Once you find the pattern, follow through;
Save us, always open the flood,
So we keep on the lookout for that
Poem in which leaves shake the sky cold,

The figures all repeat as I oft expect,
But one finds it falls back with dust of frost.
And I will wake again in dreams
With joy that calls one back to see, a friend.

- Robert Frost
