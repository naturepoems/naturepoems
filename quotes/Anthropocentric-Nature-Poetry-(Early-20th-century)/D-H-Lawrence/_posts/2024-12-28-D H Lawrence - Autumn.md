Autumn Song

When the sky is grey
  And the sunless day
  Has thrown a sigh
All over the world;
And the smoky leaves, the hue and drift,
  The rustle and warble
  Of the creek’s cool width—
Let the quiet denizens arise!
They sway on the boughs, a-twirl!

Oh, the deepening light!
  The aching light,
That fills the air, that grows
  To gently lessen, and lessens its might,
Ah, the tender folds, can it replete?

- D H Lawrence
