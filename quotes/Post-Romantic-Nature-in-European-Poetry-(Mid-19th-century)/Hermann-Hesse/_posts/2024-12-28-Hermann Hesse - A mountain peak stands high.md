A mountain peak stands high above,
Crowned in the sky, so pure, so blue,
Amidst the clouds that glide with grace,
It calls to those who seek the true.

With every step, my heart ascends,
To nature's throne, my spirit flies,
In solitude, the soul transcends,
To grasp the vast, eternal skies.

- Hermann Hesse
