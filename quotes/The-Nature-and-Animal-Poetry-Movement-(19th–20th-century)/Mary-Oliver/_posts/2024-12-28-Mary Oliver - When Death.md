When Death Comes
When death comes
like the hungry bear in autumn;
when death comes
and takes all the surprise
of me,
I want to step through the door
full of grace,
waning like a black pepper,
to know that all the world
is full of blistering beauty
and the best thing I can do
with this body,
this heart, this life—is
to walk with brightness,
look to the fields,
to the glimmer of waters,
be steady in the face of autumn.
Even in dying, may I remain
still burning,
of seasons—,
of peonies, wild critters,
deepdiving stars.

- Mary Oliver
