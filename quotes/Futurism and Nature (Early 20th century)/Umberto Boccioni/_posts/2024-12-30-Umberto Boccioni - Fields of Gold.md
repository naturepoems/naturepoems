Fields of Gold

Fields aglow,
a tapestry of life,
each stalk a promise,
whispering secrets of the sun.

Golden grains sway,
a gentle waltz with the wind,
as the earth’s breath
infuses the air with sweetness,
cloaked in the warm embrace
of summer’s intimacy.

Colors flicker and dance,
a mosaic of creation,
beyond the horizon’s edge,
a stretch of eternity beckons,
a caress of nature’s soft hand.

And though the pace quickens,
as harvest draws near,
it is the quiet pulse of nature
that endures within,
a testament to life,
a foreign yet familiar land.

--- Umberto Boccioni
