All things are mingling, and everywhere,  
In secret dances, they fly and flow;
To the throbbing pulse of the wild free air,
In the arms of earth, sweet glories grow.

Listen! the murmur of river and stream,
The rustling leaves in the whispering trees,
Nature's soft voices weave mystic dream,
As winds roam with joy on the autumn breeze.

Her pathways lead through the hill and glen,
Where shadows play, the starlit dome;
In gardens of peace, as Nature reigns,
There lies my heart, there is my home.

- James Russell Lowell
