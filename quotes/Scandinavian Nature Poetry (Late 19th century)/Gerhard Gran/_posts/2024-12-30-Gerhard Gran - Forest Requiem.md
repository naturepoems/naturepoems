Through coniferous branches, birds do sing,
A chorus soft, of love and flight,
In each sweet note, the beckoning,
Of all that dwells in morning's light.

As shadows stretch and sunbeams break,
The forest breathes a sigh of peace,
In this embrace, I find my wake,
My spirit's song shall never cease.

- Gerhard Gran
