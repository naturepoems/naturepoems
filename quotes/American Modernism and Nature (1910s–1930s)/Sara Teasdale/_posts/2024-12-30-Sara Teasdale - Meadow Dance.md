Through meadows where wildflowers spring,
a symphony bursts forth in the sun.
Colors dance beneath the wide sky,
a canvas brushed with mother’s hand.

Here lies the pulse of nature’s heart,
where all things converge in a bloom.
Behold! The drama, so alive,
woven by stir and quietude.

O to wander where children play,
to weave lives tangled in laughter.
Breathe deeply the warmth of the day,
and love the earth that gives us life.

- Sara Teasdale
