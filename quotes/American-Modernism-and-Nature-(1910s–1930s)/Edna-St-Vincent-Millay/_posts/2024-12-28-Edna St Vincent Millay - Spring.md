Spring

To what purpose, April, do you return again? 
    Beauty is not enough.  Like hunger, I go on; 
    And I can have it nowhere else than in the interstices
Of a daisy’s leaf, or the saxifrage alone.  
I seek thy presence in the fragrant rain 
    That whips the sloping stems of maple, when the ripples play;
Ah, turn of spring — wilt thou pardon me,
    And let me still breathe, where I can keep this way?

- Edna St Vincent Millay
