From the heights the mountain yields a cry,
Where shadows dance and the sun likes to die.
Oh, how I cradle the sound of each wave,
That echoes through valleys, peaceful and brave.
In nature’s arms, I gather the light,
In whispers of love hidden deep in the night.
Amidst the stillness, where life feels anew,
My heart finds a rhythm in all that is true.

- Arthur Rimbaud
