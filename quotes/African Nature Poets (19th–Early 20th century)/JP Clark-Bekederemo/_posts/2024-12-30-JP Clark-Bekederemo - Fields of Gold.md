Among the fields of gold,
Where crops sway with the breeze,
The farmer’s heart is tethered,
To the rhythms of the trees.

With every seed he places,
He dreams of harvest days,
And in his toil and labor,
He finds his joyful ways.

For nature feeds the spirit,
As much as it feeds the land,
In every grain and struggle,
Together, we must stand.
