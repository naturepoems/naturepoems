Faces

Faces through leaves, tender things, like dew,
Floating down the river, resting, at ease,
Ready for all in turn, embraces of every call—
Re-fed, unbound and splashed:
    Mainly bound to nature's look.
In sleepy dreams thinking of all places,
I gaze—familiar amazing shiftings,
Spawned in children; like wreaths of fire! 

So we rise, one clan of all that flourishes,
With each face, one within the light that we come from,
A bond on all variations, infusions round, soft.
Each face gladdening rivers—to paths we stretch.
And how equal we stem and fill, prepare turn out and breathe, 
Framing what’s just begun!

- Walt Whitman
