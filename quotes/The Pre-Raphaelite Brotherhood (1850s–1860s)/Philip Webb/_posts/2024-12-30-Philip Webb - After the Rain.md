After the Rain

When silver falls from clouds so gray,
And earth receives its soft array,
A fragrant dance of life awakens,
In every nook, the spirit beckons.

The droplets cling like jewels bright,
In tender hues that greet the light;
Each petal holds a soft, warm sigh,
As nature breathes and whispers nigh.

The world transformed, a canvas clear,
In aftermath, the heart draws near;
A symphony of scent and sound,
In after rain, true peace is found.


- Philip Webb
