The River

The River winds between the trees,
A silver thread, a whispered plea,
Carving paths through dreams untold,
A tender heart of natureâ€™s fold.

Where waters kiss the banks in play,
And lilies bloom in soft array,
Reflections tell of days gone by,
Each ripple is a gentle sigh.

Along its shores, memories swell,
Of lovers, poets, those who fell;
In each current, a song of old,
Spins tales of life in waters bold.

- Alexandre Blok
