In the Quiet of the Woods

In the quiet of the woods, I stand,
Where sunlight filters through the trees,
Each beam a blessing, a gentle touch,
Natureâ€™s breath, a calming breeze.

Murmurs of leaves, like whispered prayers,
Speak of solace, of days gone by,
In this sacred space, I find my peace,
In the heart of the woods, I learn to fly.

Each root and stone, a treasured part,
Of the tapestry that life weaves,
Here, I am whole, I am alive,
Amongst the whispers, my spirit leaves.

- Torrenti Orazio
