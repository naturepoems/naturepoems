In the garden where the roses grow,
A fragrant symphony, a lovely show,
Petals soft, a blush of grace,
In nature’s beauty, I find my place.

Butterflies flutter, bees abuzz,
Each bloom tells its tale of who it was,
With every scent, my heart does soar,
In these moments, I crave for more.

- Lytton Strachey
