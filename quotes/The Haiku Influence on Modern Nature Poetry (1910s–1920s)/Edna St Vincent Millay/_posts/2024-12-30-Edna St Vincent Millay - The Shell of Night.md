The moon is a silver shell in the night,
Softening shadows that blanket the earth.
Lapping on shores of dreams taking flight,
Each wave whispers truth to the innocence birthed.
In this quiet repose, I sense all is well,
And the world, gently cradled, gives joy infinite worth.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
