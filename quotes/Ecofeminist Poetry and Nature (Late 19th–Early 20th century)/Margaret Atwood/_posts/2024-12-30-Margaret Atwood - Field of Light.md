The field was bare,
And the wind swirled the seeds
Of a thought, grown thick;
What I remember is the intent,
Silhouettes of trees angled,
And the grasses bent low—
A universe of tiny whispers,
Round and round.
The track winds,
A narrow bit of river, left to itself;
Still, it flows, twisted, curling,
Through the pulse of silence.
It sweeps through our hands,  
To fall again.
Each stolen corner, filled
With shades of green.
The wild petals are curved;  
They stretch, slender fingers.
What is left is merely
White light and stalks of grass.

- Margaret Atwood
