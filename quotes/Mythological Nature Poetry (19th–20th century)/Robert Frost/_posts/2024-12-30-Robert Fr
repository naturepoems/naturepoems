The Sound of Trees

I wonder about the trees,
Why do we love the trees?
They scratch their limbs with everyday's play
And seated like a queen reign upon,
And everywhere they are anchored by a dance,
Or spun by winds we know too well, the sound,
The sound we hear for our own need again.

But I’m asking now a different question,
That dives towards nature's breast.
What do they know that I can’t grasp,
What do we see growing out of reach,
And can’t reclaim our roots for love,
And cannot unite again.

- Robert Frost
