Here where the trees lean down to the stream,
And the rushes whisper, soft and low,
The water lingers like a soothing dream,
Dancing lightly where wildflowers grow.

I take a seat upon the grassy bank,
With my hands outstretched to caress the sky,
While a gentle breeze breathes words of thanks,
As I bask in nature's charm, and let out a sigh.

The sunlight glimmers on the rippled flow,
And the dragonflies flit in and out of sight,
Every moment here, I find a glow,
In this small haven where all feels right.
