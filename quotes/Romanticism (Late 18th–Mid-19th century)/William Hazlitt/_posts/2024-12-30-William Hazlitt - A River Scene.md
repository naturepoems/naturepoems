A River Scene  

The river, bending to embrace the shore,  
Beneath the bending willow finds her face;  
Awake — arise, O child of earth! implore  
The winds and breezes’ spirit grace.  

The shadowy depths do kiss the sea's advance,  
Where swans like snowflakes drift upon the light;  
This glorious dance, so sweet, enchants  
With exuberance, the winds take flight!  

For life shall give thee, moments bright and free;  
From sunset heard, the ripples tell a tale;  
Of every oblivion, the sweetest thee,  
The river, flowing where the sun doth sail!

- William Hazlitt
