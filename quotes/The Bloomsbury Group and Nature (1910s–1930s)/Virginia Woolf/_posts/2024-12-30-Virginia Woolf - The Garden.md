The lavender waves rise
And cascades of blooms,
A blur of fragrance,
In the gentle sunbeam's grasp.
This garden sits like a seasoned sage,
In patience its wonders bloom,
Whispering secrets in the evening light,
Where lovers convened in dreams,
And nature listens, waiting.

— **Virginia Woolf, The Garden**
