The sounds of bees softly hum
Within the shady glen,
They come and go with buzzing words
Their pulse a tune made then.

The nectar’s sweetness blooms anew,
A taste of sugar made,
Each flower thence shall quench the thirst
Of all that life can aid.

A dew of life, divinity,
Gently falls from streams of air,
The bowers stretch in sunlight play
With life that courts a care.

I watch it sway, their wings aglow,
As joy of dinting care,
Both nectar sweet, and pollen soft,
With purpose meeting rare.

Beyond the whispers in the morn,
Their hum is life’s decree,
In harmony the bees abound,
Their song’s eternity.


- James Joyce
