CEDAR AND HOLLY

Once within the bounds of cedar,
I stood in silence, feeling whole,
The earth, a hearth, that wraps around,
Filling myself to my very soul.

With holly thick, ‘neath twilight skies,
I danced rage and peace in flight,
So rooted deep, yet coursing high,
In nature’s grace lies pure delight.


- Edna Saint Vincent Millay
