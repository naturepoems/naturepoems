The Grass so little has to do—  
A Sphere of simple Green—  
Yet audience in the name  
The Grass and I have been—  

No Man's a thing to be despised—  
The Grass, though chosen, too—  
And if he functions, never dies—  
And Kindness is his rule.  

Just as I am a Voice—  
To wander and delight—  
The Grass has but a little ferule—  
And yet it knows no blight—  

For without consummate Event,  
The Grass will have its say—  
And will diminish your lament  
Like Whispers to the Day—  


- Emily Dickinson
