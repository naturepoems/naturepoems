Easter Wings

Lord, who createdst man in wealth and store,  
Though foolishly he lost the same,  
Decaying more and more,  
Till he became  
Most poore:  
With thee, O let me rise  
As larks, harmonious and divine,  
With thee I would ascend  
To the loftier skies!  
There, with a naked heart,  
Behold thy face and sing;  
Where all the arts and worlds have flown,  
And far more weighty subjects gone.  
Let me remember thee,  
For that after-death,  
Our spirits soar  
Even here, and make a place  
Where mercyâ€™s footsteps die.



- George Herbert
