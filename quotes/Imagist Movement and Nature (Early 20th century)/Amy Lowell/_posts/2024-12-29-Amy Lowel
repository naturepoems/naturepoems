Eve

I know the hour of dusk does sway,
   And nature sighs, through twilit dreams,
The shadows play a wondrous way,
   Snaking through glow of silver beams.

And in that tender hour’s grace,
   An echo rises, soft and pure,
With softened light upon my face,
   It tempts the heart to now endure.

O Eve, the seed of woman’s frown,
   Will fashion surely a birth that spins,
As nature wakes the shadows down,
   To welcome all that morning brings!

- Amy Lowell
