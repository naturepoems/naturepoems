Resignation

The skies are bright, the sun is clear,
But flies the little freckled round,
Bring joy to fields and glades sincere,
Yet fortune gives no higher ground.

The lark cries loud, upon the morn,
And sparkling dew drops catch the light;
And yet its bright and joyous song
Is flung through clouds of misty night.

But see! the clouds that fly overhead,
Flame and gleam in the summer’s day.
But of the heart, a pressing dread
Reveals a world that fades away.

Yet gracious is the sun to bring,
Such light to challenge every tear,
Let none of us forget the sing,
Returning waves, o’ercoming fear.

Forever in the heat we’ll wade,
This life we live, is life remade!

- Matthew Arnold
