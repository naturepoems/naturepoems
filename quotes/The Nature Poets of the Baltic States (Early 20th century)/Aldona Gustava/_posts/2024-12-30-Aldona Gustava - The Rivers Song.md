The River's Song
Flowing gently, ever free,
The river sings its timeless tune,
A melody of stones and trees,
Beneath the watchful gaze of the moon.

Reflecting skies, the water's hue,
Carries tales from far and wide,
In its embrace, the world anew,
A journey where our dreams can glide.

- Aldona Gustava
