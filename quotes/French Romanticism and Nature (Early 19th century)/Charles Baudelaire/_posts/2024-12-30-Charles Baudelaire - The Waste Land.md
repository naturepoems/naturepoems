The Waste Land

In the fields of yesteryears, condemned to live,  
Where the earth, with scars and weeds, must forgive;  
Each clod a memory, each stone a sigh,  
An echo of whispers where flowers dare die.

I pass by the remnants of verdant grace,  
Now echoing winds, and lacking embrace;  
Yet within the desolation I hear  
The pulse of nature, distant yet near.

Fear not the curse of the barren ground;  
For the roots of despair find strength underground;  
From decay reborn, life spirals anew,  
In the dance of the seasonsâ€”forever in view.

- Charles Baudelaire
