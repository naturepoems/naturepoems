Amidst the flowers, wild and free,  
Each petal whispers tender truth,  
The colors blend, a vivid sea,  
Leading us back to the joys of youth.
  
The scent of earth, the song of bees,  
In every corner, life awakes,  
Tell me, friend, what do you see  
When the heart, in nature, breaks?


- Friedrich Hölderlin
