I walked through the woods today,
    breathing the scent of pine,
         where whispers of earth linger.
The sunlight flickers,
    a dance between branches,
     and I could hear the stories
of life that calls across time.

Each moment captures space,
    each shadow speaks
       of patience and trust,
   and how every heartbeat
         influences eternity.


- William Stafford
