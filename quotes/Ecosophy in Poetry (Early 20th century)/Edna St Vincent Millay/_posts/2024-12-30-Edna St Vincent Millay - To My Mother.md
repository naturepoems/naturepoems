To My Mother  
  -------------  
To my mother, who loves  
The birds and trees;  
To my mother; I see them in spring,  
When the snow is gone away.  
To my mother; I still think of  
The beauty of the day;  
And the blooming nature;  
  I thank you, dear,  
For the peace in this place;  
We shall wander on,  
From flower to flowerâ€”  
  As the world stands still,  
Until the sunset  
And the fears take flight,  
And peace shall rest again.  


- Edna St Vincent Millay
