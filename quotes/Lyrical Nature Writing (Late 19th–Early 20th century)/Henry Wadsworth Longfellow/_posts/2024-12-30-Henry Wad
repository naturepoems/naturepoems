The morning breaks with radiant grace,
And sweeps across the vale anew;
The songbirds' calls in soft embrace,
Greet earth in tones both bright and true.

The breeze astir with fragrant bloom,
Plays harmonies upon the grass,
And nature stirs from winter's gloom,
To lift the heart where sorrows pass.

In slumber lost, the world of dreams,
Awakens to a vibrant day,
While sunlight dances, sunlight beams,
And nature whispers love’s sweet play.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
