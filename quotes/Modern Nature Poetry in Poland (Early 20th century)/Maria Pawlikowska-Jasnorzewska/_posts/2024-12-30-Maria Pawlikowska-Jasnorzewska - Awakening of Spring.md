Spring emerges with a gentle hum,
awakening the world from its slumber,
a symphony of blooms and buzzing bees.
Each bud represents a promise,
a reminder that life perseveres,
no matter the winter's chill.

I breathe in the fragrant air,
allowing it to fill my lungs,
letting the joy of renewal
wash over me like light,
setting my spirit free.

Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
