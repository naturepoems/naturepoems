A river flows through valleys deep,
Where secrets dwell, and silence sleeps;
Its waters, sharp with life’s embrace,
Reflect the moonlight’s gentle grace.

It speaks of journeys, far and wide,
Where love and longing often bide;
In every bend, a tale unfolds,
Of whispered dreams, of hearts so bold.

So let us wander by its side,
With dreams and hopes, our hearts abide.
In every ripple, find our way,
Through nature’s arms, where we shall play.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
