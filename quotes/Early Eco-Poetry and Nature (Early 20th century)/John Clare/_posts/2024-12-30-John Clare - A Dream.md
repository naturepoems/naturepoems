A Dream
In dreams the fairy flits in sight  
With dew and moon that fill the air,  
Where sounds of every ripple's bite  
Turned rustling woods so bright and fair.
 
Hark to the message each star sends  
To whisper low and softly leads,  
And gentle sleep attends with friends  
In every garden where it pleads.

- John Clare
