Leaves of Grass, how do you greet the spring,
As the flowers come forth and the warmth do sing,
With each blade of grass, with each petal set free,
You embrace the earth's beauty, a dance of jubilee.

In vibrant colors and scents that arise,
You scatter your joy 'neath the vast, endless skies,
To celebrate life in its myriad forms,
In the stillness of woods and the wildest of storms.

Oh, fragrant reveal, your gentle caress,
The union of life, a divine wilderness,
Each whispering branch, each quivering bloom,
In the realm of your essence, filled with resplendent gloom.

- Walt Whitman
