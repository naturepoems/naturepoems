Walking in the Woods

Weathered wood, the earth unfolds, 
The scent of cedar breathes beneath the bark;
And as I walk, the wind draws through the trees,
To beckon secrets through and throughâ€”
The soft embrace of earth upon my feet
Like tiny flames, every breath I take
Shall brush past the shimmers bound and lose,
As hands of nature stir about my chest,
While each step is a hymn, a small echoing.
Lo, I bow my head throw and throw,
To recall the wild spins of living so,
For while I linger, watching jade arise,
These woodsy welcomes consume me whole.
