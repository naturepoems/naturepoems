Shadows of clouds  
Trace the canvas of the earth,  
Painting tales of lost journeys,  
Where rivers of crystal laughter  
Pour through valleys of thyme;  
In that moment,  
I feel suspended,  
Driving my spirit into the sky  
Above the mountains that embrace  
The world in a breathtaking sigh.

- Guido Gozzano
