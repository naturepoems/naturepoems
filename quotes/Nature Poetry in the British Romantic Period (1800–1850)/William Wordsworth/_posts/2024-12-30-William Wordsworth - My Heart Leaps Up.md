My heart leaps up when I behold
A rainbow in the sky:
So was it when my life began;
So is it now I am a man;
So be it when I shall grow old,
Or let me die!

Before high God I stand alone,
A child, and none can see;
Until justice seize my own,
May I have mercy’s courage known,
And to you, child, return my tone,
And Eagle's wings to me.

- William Wordsworth
