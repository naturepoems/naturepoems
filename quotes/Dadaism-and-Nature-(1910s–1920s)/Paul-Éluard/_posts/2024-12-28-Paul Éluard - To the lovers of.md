To the lovers of nature
To the lovers of the leaves
To those who breathe
The air of springtime
I offer you these verses,
These fruits of the earth,
These blossoms of spirit.

Oh the beauty of the simple
In the dance of the wind,
In the gentle caress of petals,
In the arms of trees.
Come, listen to the silence
That speaks in the heart of the woods.

The sky is a mirror,
Reflecting the secrets of the clouds,
And the rivers sing their lullabies
To the mountains that cradle their dreams.

- Paul Éluard
