From the forest came a whisper:
Leaf by leaf my world is built,
Home to every creature, dancer,
Blessed with shadow, light, and guilt.

Oft I tread upon my bounty,
Softly felt beneath my feet,
Hull of thoughts as deep as ocean,
Voices of the woods repeat.

In a single fallen petal,
Beauty finds her way in flight;
Let the world take from this bounty,
For my soul finds pure delight.

- Robert Frost
