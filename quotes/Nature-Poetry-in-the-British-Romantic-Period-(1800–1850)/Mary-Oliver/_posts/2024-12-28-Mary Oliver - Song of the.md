Song of the Builders
The Houses are made of wood, wiry and thin,
yet I want to hear a voice, as the syllables spin
through the branches, a tangled song blowing up,
a miracle's grace, rippling softly on the surface.
When I am least aware, they come gathered
where immediate wildness thickens the shade.
Wind and sea grant me my place for rain.
Let all the hammers come down, to build my frame,
from the shadowed weeds, the golden sun, the flame.

- Mary Oliver
