In the Woods

O woods, where the shadows creep,
And the whispers of the breeze
Tell tales of the earth asleep;
Where the crowding bramble-leaves
Are softer than whispering thieves,
And the shadows creep.

In your green depths I’ve found
A peace that the world forgot;
Your silence, that knows no sound,
Yet speaks with a voice I sought,
Among the clamor of man’s crowd,
I listen, my heart is bowed.

- Rosa Zagnoni Marinone
