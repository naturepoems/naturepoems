Fair as the morn is the wild-wood's scene,
Where the sunlight dances on carpeted green;
Where the lilies and violets star the brook,
And the thrush and the blackbird are singing their book.

O nature, what beauty thy bounty has spread,
Of flower and fern, where the rich moss is spread;
And the rippling waters that laugh as they run,
In the cheer of thy presence, O beautiful sun!

- George Edmund Street
