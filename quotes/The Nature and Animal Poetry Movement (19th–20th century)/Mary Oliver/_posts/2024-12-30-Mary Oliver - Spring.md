Spring

Oh, to love the world,
from a green, sweet place
and the quietness of an opening bud!
That moment, when the child learns to walk,
he’s so surprised!
What! I can do this?
So must I marvel at the first green of spring
and the deep purple of the crocus,
all opened and star-like,
for us in praise of spring.
The sky always clouds over these days,
but it’s good to let the sun in just the same.
When we walk the trails—so wild and new—
I lean to feel the ground beneath my steps.
My heart would hurry,
it’s so young still, and it loves every green thing!

The woodland speaks:
There’s never been a spring
that hasn’t brought life back from the dead.
To any heart that’s empty,
it whispers the times
when young love pressed close
between the emerge of spring,
filling the earth with yes, yes, yes!

- Mary Oliver
