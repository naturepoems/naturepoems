Whispers of the Wild

In the heart of the forest,
Where trees stand tall and wise,
The whispers of the wild,
Emerge under vast, open skies.

Every creature knows its place,
In this intricate design,
From the tiniest of insects,
To lions that boldly dine.

Listen to the heartbeat,
Of the earth, strong and true,
For in every breath we take,
Nature speaks clear to you.

- Ossie Mthembu
