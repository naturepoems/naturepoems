The winter sky hangs low,
a shroud over the earth’s sleeping.
The trees are bare, yet steadfast,
a reminder of endurance.

Snow blankets the world,
a silent canvas awaiting the brush.
Here lies the promise of spring,
hidden in the cold embrace.

In this pause, I hear life’s heartbeat,
each pulse a prayer for rebirth,
a quiet resolve under the stillness.
