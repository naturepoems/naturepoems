The Blue-Flag Iris

   Smoothly the flower, with its vapors,
glimmers, the touch of its velvet-style
  in the air in a blue-gray fragility,
   a quiet motion to compliment 
a rush of winds that pull
   the beautiful stalk from the roots—a hush.
   And there is a substance to the earth:  yes, the shiny
       bud of the blue-flag iris blooming quietly
        along the silver-edged marsh.


- Marianne Moore
