Behold the flowers in their bloom,
Emerging from the winter’s gloom;
Their colors burst in joyous song,
In nature’s reign, we all belong.

Each petal soft, each scent divine,
A promise held in every vine;
In gardens lush, we find our peace,
In nature’s dance, our souls release.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
