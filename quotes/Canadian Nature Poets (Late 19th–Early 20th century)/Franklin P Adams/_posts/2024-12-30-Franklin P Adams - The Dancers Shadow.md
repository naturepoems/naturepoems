The Dancer's Shadow

In twilight’s glow, the shadows play,
A dance of light at close of day,
The trees, they sway, the grasses bow,
In Nature’s theater, here and now.

With every breeze, a story spins,
Of ancient tales and time that begins,
In dance so wild, so free, so grand,
We find ourselves, we understand.


- Franklin P Adams
