The geese are flying,
The sun is setting, the sky is nigh,
With wings of white and wings of gray,
They'd wing their way towards the bay,
On high they soar, and onward sway,
A thousand miles away from here,
With honks that echo, far and near,
In harmony with dusk's sweet song,
While fading day moves swiftly on.

- Hamlin Garland
