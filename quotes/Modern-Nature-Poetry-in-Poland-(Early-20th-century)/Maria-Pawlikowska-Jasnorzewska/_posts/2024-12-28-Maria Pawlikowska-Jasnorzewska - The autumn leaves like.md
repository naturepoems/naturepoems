The autumn leaves, like laughter,
Spiral to the earth below,
Turning the world into a canvas,
With colors of love, of letting go.

In the crisp air, the scent of change,
A promise woven in the fabric
Of the seasons shifting,
And as I stroll through this beauty,
My heart dances with the falling leaves.

- Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
