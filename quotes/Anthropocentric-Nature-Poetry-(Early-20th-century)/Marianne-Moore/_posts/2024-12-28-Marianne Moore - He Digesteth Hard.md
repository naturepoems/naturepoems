He Digesteth Hard Things

The kingfisher sits on the stone,
The starling swells in autumn's ineffable glow,
The owls whom the songbirds have left alone,
And ask the unmeasured copy of the starlight:

Why be so equal as the wings of light,
When all else fades into the muted hours?


- Marianne Moore
