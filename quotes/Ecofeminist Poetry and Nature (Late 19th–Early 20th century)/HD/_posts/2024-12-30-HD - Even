Evening

The dusk leans low,
toward the line,
  the sea that softly grows.
The yellow-green waxes;
a crisp of drift-line’s scents;
the trees stand clutching their shadows,
dorment yet drawing close.

Really, it is vast like a dream,
dashing before the sun sinks.
That wafts near the edge of blind grasp,
  that returns like wind-bound,
with a faint wind's bend,
  towards the dusk length flying.

H.D.
