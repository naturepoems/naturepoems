The Song of Wandering Aengus
I went out to the hazel wood,
Because a fire was in my head,
And I cut and peeled a hazel wand,
And I went to the glade in the wood,
And I sat down to make a fire.

When the trackless woods do twine,
In a dream Iâ€™ll cast a line
In the glade, nine pike-chub shall lie,
And when the summer breaks, and leave
The woodland dry, I will fly to thee.

And at the last, indeed, I should not shy,
But learn deep buried wood-songs long ago.
The hazel wand was full of mystery,
So in the woodland depth I got the secret of the lines.

- William Butler Yeats
