A stream of light flows from the dawn,
  As the day begins to spring;
The wildrose laughs on petals drawn,
  The lonely robin sings.

With every living pulse of air,
  The tree-tops dance and sway;
And as the fern leaves nicely share,
  The dreams of folded day.

Oh, would that I could stay and cling
  To this sweet breath of time;
And wander lonely, free, and sing
  An endless summer rhyme.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
