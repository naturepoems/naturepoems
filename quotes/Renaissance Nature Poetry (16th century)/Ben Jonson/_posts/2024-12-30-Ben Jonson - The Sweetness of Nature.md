The Sweetness of Nature

Nature, rich upon the breast,
  Craves the sighs of earthy care,
The heart finds in that sacred rest,
  Each olive branch a momentâ€™s prayer.

   O thou that washes love in soil,
   With breath of beauty, sweet abode,
And all whose lives become the toil,
  Would fall upon the twilight road.

- Ben Jonson
