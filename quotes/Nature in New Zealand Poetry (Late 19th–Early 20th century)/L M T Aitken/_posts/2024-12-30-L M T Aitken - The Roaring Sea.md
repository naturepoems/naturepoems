The roaring sea, with wild desire,
   Casts foamy arms ’gainst rock and sand;
Her voice is like a trumpet choir,
   A call to every distant land.

Each wave that crashes, fierce and bold,
   Tells tales of ships that sailed afar;
Of tempest storms and treasures told,
   The ocean’s heart, a guiding star.


- L M T Aitken
