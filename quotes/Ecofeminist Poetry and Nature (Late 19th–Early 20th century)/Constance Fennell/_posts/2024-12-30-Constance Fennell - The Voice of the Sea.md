The Voice of the Sea

O, mighty sea! The rolling waves that speak,
  Whisper of sorrows, dreams, desires unseen;
  You soothe the spirit, yet the heart you seek,
  For in thy depths a world of hope has been.

The tides that dance upon the ancient shore,
  Carry the flux of time, they ebb, they flow;
  Their breathful whispers blend with ocean's roar,
  And in that rhythm, life’s own truths we know.

In tempestuous storms, when tempers rise,
  And all the world seems lost within the foam,
  The steadfast rocks, they wear the earth's disguise,
  Remind us all to seek the final home.

O, mighty sea! Such beauty and such pain,
  In every ripple echoes joy and strife,
  Teach us to love, to laugh, to rise again,
  For in your depths, unfurl the scroll of life.
