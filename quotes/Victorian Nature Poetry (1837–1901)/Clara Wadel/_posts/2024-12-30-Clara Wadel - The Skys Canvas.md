The Sky’s Canvas

Each dawn unfolds a painted sky,
With strokes of pink and gold entwined,
As clouds parade, they float and fly,
A masterpiece, by nature signed.

The setting sun, in vivid hues,
Adorns the space where day is done,
With every twilight, there's a muse,
In colors rich, the night begun.

When stars emerge, a quiet glow,
In stillness, every heart shall find,
The sky's canvas, a gentle flow,
A whispered dream, for all mankind.

- Clara Wadel
