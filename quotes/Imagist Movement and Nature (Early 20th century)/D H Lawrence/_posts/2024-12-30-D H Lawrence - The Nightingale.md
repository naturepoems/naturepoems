The Nightingale

  The nightingale's song, it flows,
  a pool of blissful air in darkness,
  calling sweetly through the greens,
  inhalations of endless night,
  froth of silences bring imprints clear.

  Martyrs of the darkâ€”sowers,
  they bind the spring of sorrow
  in leavens long awoken,
  courting secret green, pale angels' flight,
  shifting swells, a crescent love of stars.


- D H Lawrence
