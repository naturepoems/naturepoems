The Moon in the River

The moon in the river
Is a quiet fish.
I dive in and am queer.
I live among the stones
With my purple fetched
From the ocean floor.
I keep it in the bank,
For all the rivers know,
I let it grow old,
I bury the dead in a grave of mangoes.

And the moon is a silent
Heron flapping.
The clouds are my friends,
And I stomp on their backs,
So they scream and huddle
In the storm, confused—discarded.

The moon in the river
Is a quiet fish.
I dive in and am queer.
I live among the stones
With my hair flowing.


- Richard Huelsenbeck
