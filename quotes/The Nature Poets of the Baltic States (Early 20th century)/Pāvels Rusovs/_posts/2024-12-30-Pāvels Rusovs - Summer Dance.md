In meadows kissed by sunlight,
Where the daisies wear their crowns,
Bees hum their sweet serenades,
While butterflies pirouette,
In the dance of a summer's day.

Every blade of grass rejoices,
In the warmth of the sun's glimmer,
And the sky stretches endlessly,
Inviting all who linger,
To bask in nature’s soft embrace.
