After Apple-Picking
My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still,
And there's a barrel that I didn't fill
Beside it, and there may be two or three
Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.
But I am done with apple-picking now.

Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.
I cannot shake the shimmer from my sight
I got from looking through a pane of glass
I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
And held against the sky. I had a farm.

The apple-picker's vision is true.

I have a great fear of falling
Running to catch up with light falling.
Aren't lights made to fall apart?
No one else could find parts of me,
Then all again should I become solid.
Of homes I knew in the apple trees.

The beckoning earth becomes intermediate.
With the frost on the form of the day.
After apple-picking, I am now part of the tree.
Hold the apples back, keep something for tomorrow.

- Robert Frost
