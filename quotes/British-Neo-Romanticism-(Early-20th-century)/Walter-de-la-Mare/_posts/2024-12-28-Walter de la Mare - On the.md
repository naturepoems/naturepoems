On the Wind
The wind is a whisper, a soft tender sigh, 
  It brings us the tales of the day, 
It twirls through the valleys, and flutters on high, 
  It carries our troubles away. 
In that gentle caress, we may find a refrain, 
  It follows the hearts that have strayed; 
Our laughter is balm for the sorrow and pain, 
  That the wind carries gently, unfrayed.


- Walter de la Mare
