Under the Elm

Under the elm I sat this noon,
With a bee buzzing round,
And the gossamer gliders slid,
Through the silence and the sound;

The sunlight deep soaked the roots,
Astir with the soft summer air,
And shadows flowed from high to low,
Embracing the world down there;

- Elizabeth Palmer Peabody
