Spring Awakens

With the breath of spring,  
Hope unfurls like petals,  
Life seeps from the soil,  
Stirring colors to awaken,
The branches sway in anticipation  
As the world stretches forth,
Ready to embrace the sun.

Each morning brings the warmth,
Each night the chorus of crickets,
And I can feel the laughter  
Of nature weaving through my veins,
Barefoot on the earth,  
I dance among the dreams of flowers.


- Robert Bly
