The Wild

The sun broke through the clouds in a blaze of light, 
Pulsing through the vastness, unveiling its might, 
Where shadows retreated from nature’s fierce heat, 
The wilderness whispered beneath my feet. 

From every nook, a creature emerged, 
For food, for life, their spirits surged, 
The howl of the wolf a haunting refrain, 
A symphony played in this beautiful plane. 

For man, this wild may seem a threat, 
But in the chaos, the secret is met— 
To thrive is to understand, to delve, to expand, 
In the heart of the wild, we find a true land.

- Jack London
