The Seasons

Each season brings a tale to tell,  
In nature’s rhythm, all is well;  
With spring’s fresh blooms and the summer’s heat,  
Autumn’s crispness beneath our feet.  

Winter comes with its cloak of white,  
A peaceful pause, the world is bright;  
Yet burdens of time we gently bear,  
In harmony with nature, she lays us bare.  

For in every cycle, we grow and change,  
Embracing the wild, the beautiful range;  
So let us celebrate life’s endless flow,  
In the symphony of seasons that forever grow.

- E J Brady
