In quiet nooks where wild things roam,  
And woods and water meet as friends,  
I seek the spell of nature’s poem,  
Where every verse on breath depends.  
The birds are singing softly low,  
Amid the branches all a-glow;  
And in the stillness, dark and bright,  
Nature unveils her pure delight.

- Bliss Carmen
