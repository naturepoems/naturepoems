At the lake's edge,  
a stillness waits,  
the water glassy as a mirror,  
a portal to the skies.  
Reflections ripple,  
stirred by life lurking  
beneath the surface;  
fish dart,  
a flurry of movement  
in the quiet arms of time.  
Nature holds her breath,  
a moment suspended,  
a balance between  
the seen and the unseen,  
where the magic of existence  
whispers softly in the breeze,  
a gentle reminder that all  
is bound by the delicate thread of life.
