In Praise of Solitude

I love to be alone in nature, 
With nothing but the marbled sky and ground, 
Paths winding softly in and out, 
Infusing color back into my heart.

The edges of the trees breathe around me,
As they sway and embrace the winds blowing,
Rich echoes drifting like clouds that tease 
And caress the earth with tranquility.
I sit in silence, resting amongst shadows,
Where the sun passes over and the birds reply,
As each whisper travels far,
Rippling through the silence of my solitude.

Let me be renewed by this quiet presence,
And like the phases of the moonâ€”
Embrace the world, unnoticed, and dwell,
In the harmony found within the natural realm.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
