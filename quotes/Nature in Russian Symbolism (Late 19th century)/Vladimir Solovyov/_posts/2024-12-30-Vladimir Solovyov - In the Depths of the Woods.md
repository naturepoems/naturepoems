The deep woods call with ancient voice,
In silence deep, we find our choice;
Among the trees, in shadows deep,
Nature's wisdom, ours to keep.

Each rustling leaf, a history speaks,
In every branch, the journey peeks;
Together we roam, and in this glide,
The heart of nature, our guide.

- Vladimir Solovyov
