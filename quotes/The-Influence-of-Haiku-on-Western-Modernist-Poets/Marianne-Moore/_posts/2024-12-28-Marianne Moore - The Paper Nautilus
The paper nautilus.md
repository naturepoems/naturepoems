quote: "The Paper Nautilus
"The paper nautilus, a subtle form
of ocean life, creates with delicate ease,
a perfect spiral of water and air.
It, the moonlight's filament, fragile,
a form that floats, yet is so much more."
- Marianne Moore"

"The paper nautilus, a subtle form
of ocean life, creates with delicate ease,
a perfect spiral of water and air.
It, the moonlight's filament, fragile,
