Wildness

In the heart of the wild, a wisdom unfolds,  
Of mountains untouched and waters that sing;  
In forests ablaze, each season beholds,  
Life's magnificent splendor, a beautiful ring.

Let us bask in the wildness, the spirit so free,  
In the dance of the creatures, the rustle of leaves;  
Every whisper of wind, a sweet mystery,  
In nature’s embrace, where the heart never grieves.

Life flows like the river, fierce, bold, and true,  
With every heartbeat echoing nature’s own rhyme;  
In wildness, O dreamer, find meaning anew,  
For the stories she tells are never out of time.
