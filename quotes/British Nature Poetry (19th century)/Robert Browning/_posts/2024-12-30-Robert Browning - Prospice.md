The rain set early in to-night,
   The sullen wind was soon awake,
It tore the elm-tops down for spite,
   And did its worst to vex the lake:
I listened with heart fit to break.

When glided in Proserpine,
   With her stole of wreath√®d flowers,
Her hair over her arm did twine,
   The woman on my garden bowers,
   She hid in a jewel of showers.

I felt my heart in my breast beat fast:
   I knew the storm about to burst;
For the wind did howl and the rain poured vast,
   But a vision came to me of comfort first;
   I prayed my prayer and the tempest cursed.

- Robert Browning
