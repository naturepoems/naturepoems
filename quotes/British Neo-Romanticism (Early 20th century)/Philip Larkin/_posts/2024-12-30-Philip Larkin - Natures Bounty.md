From the bramble to the towering pine,  
There’s solace wrapped in nature’s arms.  
In blooming fields where grasses twine,  
We find protection from life's harms.

An echo speaks beyond our reach,  
To bind our senses in the air;  
The trees, the sky, the sounds that teach,  
The quiet faith, the endless care.

So let us walk this verdant road,  
Hand in hand with each rustled leaf.  
For in each moment, grace bestowed,  
Brings joy of nature's sweet belief.


- Philip Larkin
