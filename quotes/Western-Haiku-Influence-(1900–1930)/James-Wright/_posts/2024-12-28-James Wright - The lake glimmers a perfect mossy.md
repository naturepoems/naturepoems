author: James Wright
quote: "The lake glimmers, a perfect mossy mirror, 
Reflecting sighs of the trees, 
Each rustle of leaves feels like a prayer, 
As I walk alone, thoughts tangled in air, 
Nature’s solitude mapping my heart."

The lake glimmers, a perfect mossy mirror, 
Reflecting sighs of the trees, 
Each rustle of leaves feels like a prayer, 
As I walk alone, thoughts tangled in air, 
Nature’s solitude mapping my heart.

- James Wright
