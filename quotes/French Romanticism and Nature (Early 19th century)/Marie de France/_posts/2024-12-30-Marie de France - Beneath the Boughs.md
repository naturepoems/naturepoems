Beneath the boughs of ancient trees,
Where sunlight dapples on the ground,
In quiet corners, nature frees,
The whispers of her heart profound.

The streamâ€™s soft murmur, lullabies,
As frogs in harmony do croak,
While silver fish beneath the lies,
In gleeful leaps, the surface broke.

- Marie de France
