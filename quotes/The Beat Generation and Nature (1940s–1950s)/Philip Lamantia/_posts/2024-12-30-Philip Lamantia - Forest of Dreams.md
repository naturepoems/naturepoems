I walked through a forest of dreams
in which the stars hung low,
      pregnant with shadows and light,
     the clouds wrapping the trees
            in azure jackets of longing.

From every trunk, sweet
         secrets of silence bloomed,
            a song bursting forth,
  with each step an echo
     dancing amongst the rocks.


- Philip Lamantia
