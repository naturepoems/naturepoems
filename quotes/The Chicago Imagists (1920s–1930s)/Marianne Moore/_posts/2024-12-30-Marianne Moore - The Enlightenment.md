The Enlightenment
All beauty rests on the immanence
        of that which learned;
All solemnness of rebirth,
        salvation-in-sight; uninvited, 
More than liquid color in dusk’s run,
        illuminating waters spread beyond bound,
        dually discovered colors mask over-nights,
        pulled away in woods, slumbered,
through rock, dirt, syntax buoyed in the drifted,
        natural address upon stone—all life,
        alluring as chances grace might drown.

I melt about me, wide and unsure,
        shapes defining, revealing, flowering in light!
Striking echoes cast long shadows,
        pulling brightly revealing worlds far, yet faint to arms;
Death naively roving the open grounds of feet
        each daisy tries to feel—
        as roots bend in sweet wood.
A newborn sees the fleeting twilight,
        for empathy is the deephesis amidst—
        I shall never die, returning an ancient place!

- Marianne Moore
