Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,
But to be young was very heaven!
O times, in which the meadows saw,
Life's actors playing 'neath the stars.

The ancient glories come to life,
In every rustle that I hear,
The air infused with fragrant strife,
Of blossoms that the spring drew near.

Let all my thoughts be tuned to grace,
In nature's own authentic space,
And, with each hour, my heart obey,
To find anew the light of day.


- William Wordsworth
