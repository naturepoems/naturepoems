Dawn

Each cusp of morning holds,
    a pristine awakening —
    as whispers wake the branches,
      and sighs take flame —
while the dew settles bold,
   as glimmering stars bow down.

Beyond the mist, I hold promise,
   as light flows into obsidian,
   dawn's quiet embrace,
       and I too awaken,
            to grasp nature's embrace.

- Lorine Niedecker
