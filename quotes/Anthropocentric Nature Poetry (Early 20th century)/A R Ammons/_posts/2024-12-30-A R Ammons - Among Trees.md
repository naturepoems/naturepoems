Among Trees

I wish I could tell you
  of the old trees held fast,
  muttering quietly,
the clouds pulling against them;
I feel how day twists slowly
  in the green shadows,
freckles of sunlight divide
  the leaves, touching me, 
then receding
  like answered prayers.
Dress me with ground,
  with moss, with lichen;
carry me across this quiet, this stillness,
until I am just roots,
  buried in earth, listening.
Every tree speaks
  of time, of depth, of love â€”
I wish to dwell there.

- A R Ammons
