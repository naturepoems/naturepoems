Winter Light

The light is pale on the frost-bitten earth,
Like a thought just at the edge of reason,
Each breath of wind a shivering reminder,
That life stirs beneath the icy crust,
Where the wild hares dart in the distance.

There is a purity in the winter air,
A clarity that cuts through the fog of time,
And the silence, deep as the quiet hour,
Holds its breath, waiting for the thaw,
For springâ€™s gentle fingers to break the dusk.


- George Mackay Brown
