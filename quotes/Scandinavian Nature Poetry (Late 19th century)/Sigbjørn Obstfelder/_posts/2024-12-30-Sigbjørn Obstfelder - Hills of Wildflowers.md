Upon the hills, where the wildflowers bloom,
Life bursts into color, a joyous parade;
With each petal unfurling, the earth rejoices,
And the heart swells with love for the beauty displayed.

Butterflies flit, like soft whispers of grace,
And the sun dances low, painting shadows long;
In this moment, pure splendor unfolds,
Nature’s sweet anthem—her ever-timeless song.

- Sigbjørn Obstfelder
