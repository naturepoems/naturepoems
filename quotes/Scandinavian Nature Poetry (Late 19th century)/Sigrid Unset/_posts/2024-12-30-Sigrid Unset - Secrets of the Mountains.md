The mountains hold the secrets deep,
In ancient stone, their wisdom keep.
In nature's arms, our hearts can seep,
A bond that time could never reap.

The silver streams that twist and weave,
Through valleys fair, they seem to grieve.
Yet in their depths, we can believe,
In miracles that they achieve.

- Sigrid Unset
