Hills that roll like waves of green,  
In valleys deep where wildflowers bloom,  
A painter's dream, a tranquil scene,  
Nature’s brush, dispelling gloom.

The scent of earth, a fragrant song,  
As gentle breezes sway the trees,  
In harmony where hearts belong,  
Nature’s embrace, a soft reprise.


- Yves Tanguy
