Spring
There is not a spring that wakes and creeps
In couched delight among the glade,
And wakes the shivering, speaking trees,
As nature breathes sweet serenade.
\nFor this may breathe the soul of joy
Into the heart of those who see,
The way the grass a-press upon a joy—
Nature flows and lives to be!
\nNow here it blooms, now there it blows,
A wondrous light, a holiday,
But every flower unto its wandered rose
Is honor’d as the time does day.

- George Meredith
