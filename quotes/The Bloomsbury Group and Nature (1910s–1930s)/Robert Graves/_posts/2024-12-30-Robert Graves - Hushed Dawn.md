Oh hush me to the dawn's coming glow,
With petals wide, like wings upon the air;
Let the melody of time softly flow,
In scents of morning's haunt, alive and rare.
With dewdrops kissed by the sun's embrace,
Whispers through lilac hues and golden light,
With every beat, I will find the trace
Of nature's breath in a world so bright.  


- Robert Graves
