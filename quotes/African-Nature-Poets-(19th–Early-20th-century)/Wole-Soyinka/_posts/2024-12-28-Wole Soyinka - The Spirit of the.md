The Spirit of the Plains
The plains stretch out, a golden sea,
Underneath the sun's authority.
O take a breath, breathe in the air,
In the hush of dusk, there's magic rare.

Where the wildflowers paint the ground,
In a tribute of colors, beauty unbound,
And the grazing herds whisper tales,
As the night drenches the lingering trails.

Each sigh in the winds, a distant song,
Of ancestors who watched for so long,
A legacy carved in each rise and fall,
The spirit of the plains, a reminder to all.

- Wole Soyinka
