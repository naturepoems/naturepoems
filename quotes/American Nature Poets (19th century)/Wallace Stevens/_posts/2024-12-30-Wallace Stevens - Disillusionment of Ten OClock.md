Disillusionment of Ten O'Clock

The houses are haunted
   By white night-gowns.
   None are green and black,
   Like the columbine.

The martini and the tawny
   And the quicksilver arms,
Beware the snoring
   Through the rooms of sleep.

The bears, half-asleep,
   On the white moons of the air.
   The snoring is so grave
   It wears the world.

Drunken evenings of silk
   Where nothing happens at all,
   We hear our wives sigh
   Behind the walls.

With dim passions of the soul,
   And the sense of why,
   They wander and wander,
   Get into things, for desire,

The only breath of life,
   Falls asleep on the balcony
   Of this silent hour.
