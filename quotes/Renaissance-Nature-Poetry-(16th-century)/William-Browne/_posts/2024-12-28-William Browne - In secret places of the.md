In secret places of the woods,
High oâ€™er the brook, the singing bee,
And birds that draw in varied moods,
Compose sweet songs for joy to see.

Each flower that by the pathway bends,
Each leaf that rustles in the sun,
Contributes to the peace that mends,
And stirs the soul, as day is done.


- William Browne
