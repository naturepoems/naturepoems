In the quiet of morning,
the dew glistens on each petal,
a fragile beauty arises,
where light gently touches life.
I wake with the sun,
to drink in the elixir of dawn,
the air rich with possibility,
a canvas where hopes are painted.

I see the flowers bloom,
they open like hearts,
warmth radiating from their cores,
a reflection of our dreams.
Here, in this sacred moment,
we are a part of this magic,
a testimony to resilience,
through the cycles of life and death.


- Pablo Neruda
