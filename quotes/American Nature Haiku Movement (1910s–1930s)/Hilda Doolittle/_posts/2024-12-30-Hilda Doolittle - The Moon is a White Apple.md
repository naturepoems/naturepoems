The moon is a white apple
       that has fallen into night.
       Leaves turn,
       hand over hand, covering them;  
       the apple falls through frost,
       across the spear of dawn,
       fresh in the brown,  
       and it is not yet this day,
       the wind still sleeps   
       under the last leaves.

- Hilda Doolittle
