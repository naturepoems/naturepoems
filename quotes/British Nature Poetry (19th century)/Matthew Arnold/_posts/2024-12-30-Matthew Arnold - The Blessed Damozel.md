Through the great arch, the infinite sky,
The universe broods soft and wide;
Time wanders by with his eager sigh,
I wander through the woods and bide.

The brook dances over the stones,
With a merry laugh and a sweet refrain;
Peaceful whispers in hallowed tones,
The silver trees the joy sustain.


- Matthew Arnold
