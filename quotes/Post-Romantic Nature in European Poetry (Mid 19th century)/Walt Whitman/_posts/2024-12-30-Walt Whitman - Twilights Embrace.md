The serenity of twilight descends,
As shadows stretch over the hill,
Anointing the earth where grief mends,
In the sweet scent of the dilapidated chill.

Nature, you hold the key to our healing,
With furrows deep, and clouds that spin,
In the edge of your heart, it is revealing,
The soft place where all life can begin.

So let us unite under stars so bright,
Join hands with the here and the now,
In the quiet wisdom of the night,
We shall vow our love to the vow.

- Walt Whitman
