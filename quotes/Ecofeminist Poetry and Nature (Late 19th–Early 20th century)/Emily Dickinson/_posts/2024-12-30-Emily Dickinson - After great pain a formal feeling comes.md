After great pain, a formal feeling comes –  
The nerves sit ceremonious, like tombs –  
The stiff Heart questions, was it He, that bore,  
And Yesterday, or Centuries before?  

The Feet, mechanical, go round –  
Of Ground, or Air, or Ought –  
And the Erased within me thumps –  
A little drum,  
So big the dust – that pets the Pain!  

Then also – for the killing winds –  
That are the last to call –  
For the happiest hours of my life – whose loss larger than large –  


- Emily Dickinson
