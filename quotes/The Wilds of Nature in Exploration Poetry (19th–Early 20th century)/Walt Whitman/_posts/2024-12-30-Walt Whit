Leaves of Grass - An Old Man’s Thought of School

I think of the grass, the sprouting leaves,
The lost child running in the meadows,
The weave of nature surrounding,
Infinite in lessons from soil to sky.

The school’s out, yet learning deep inside,
Where knowledge transcends, dancing wild,
The wisdom comes from touch of each season,
And the echo speaks through laughter, tears, and pride.


- Walt Whitman
