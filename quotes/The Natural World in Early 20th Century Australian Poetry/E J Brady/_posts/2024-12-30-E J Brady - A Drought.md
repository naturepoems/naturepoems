A Drought

The spot where the creek once ran,  
Is a dry, parched land,  
Where the sun beats down  
On the golden sand.  

The earth is cracked before me  
Like a wound laid bare,  
And the wind whispers softly  
To the silence there.  

The hard blue sky above  
Holds no promise of rain,  
Only a shimmering heat,  
That drives the heart to pain.  

The trees stand gaunt and lonely  
With their leaves turned to brown,  
In this land where water is  
An unremembered crown.  

The river bed, a ghostly line,  
Stretches far and wide,  
A reminder of the days  
When water flowed like pride.

- E J Brady
