To Sleep 
O soft embalmer of the still midnight, 
Shutting, with careful fingers and benign, 
Our father’s eyes, weigh’d down with the night, 
Bring, when the day returns, a sweeter sign. 
Let the starlight be architecture fair, 
Twinkle those meadows gentle near the sky; 
For it should be in gardens there— 
Your fingers weaving earth’s flow’rs where they lie. 
So light the walls, breathing a lulling flow 
That curls around the night air’s silence wide; 
Unto the depths of nature’s fairest glow 
That fills my heart with all that it can abide.

- John Keats
