Autumn's Call

Turn, turn again, O leaf that falls,
                Your message whispers, heed the call;
Autumn’s cloak of amber bright,
                Wraps the world in fading light.

From green to gold, and gold to grey,
                Each petal’s flight shifts night to day;
Beneath the tree I linger long,
                With nature’s heart, I feel her song.


- William Morris
