The wind has blown the leaves away,
And the grass is dry and brown;
The flowers have lost their fragrance, too,
And the sun is going down.
But the heart is like a good fire,
It warms the chill of night;
And the stars shine bright,
In the clear moonlight.

Let us gather together in the quiet of the wood,
Let us talk of our dreams and hopes,
And the troubles that do not do us good,
And let our spirits climb the slopes.
The world may turn and change its face,
But we are here, in this sacred space.  


- George William Russell
