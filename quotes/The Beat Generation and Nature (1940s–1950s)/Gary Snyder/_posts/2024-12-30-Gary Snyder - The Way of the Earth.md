The Way of the Earth
The way of the Earth is to go on in,
root twines within root,
passing the qi that runs,
inward from the world.

The green path leads on,
to the clearings of the mind,
to the dark places of the body,
to the edges of the earth,
where the roots dig in
and find a way out.

The way of the Earth is a way of listening.

— Gary Snyder
