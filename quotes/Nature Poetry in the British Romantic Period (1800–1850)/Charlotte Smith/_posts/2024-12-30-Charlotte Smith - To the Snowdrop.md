To the Snowdrop,
   by Charlotte Smith

If winter comes, can spring be far behind?  
Ah! yes; for through the long and dreary night,  
Unstirred by your soft light,  
Hope cannot be—naked and cold remain  
The flowers that once were bright—  
Ye feel not, O ye drooping buds!  
That the Time, the Life returning,  
Brings with it joy—but yours its breath  
May wait.  

Yet I will trust you, on the bending bough,  
Your meek and blushing flower,  
Will once again behold the sun,  
Despite the slowest of your gory fate.

- Charlotte Smith
