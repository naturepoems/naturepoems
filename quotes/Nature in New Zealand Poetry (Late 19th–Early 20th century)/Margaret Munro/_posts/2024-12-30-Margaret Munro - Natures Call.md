Nature's Call

The mountains high, the rivers low,  
In every breath, the wild winds blow,  
The call of nature, strong and clear,  
Invites my soul to draw it near.

In fields of green, and skies of blue,  
Where every shade holds life anew,  
I wander, seek, and find my place,  
In nature's love, a warm embrace.

Oh, earth and sky, I heed your plea,  
In every moment, wild and free,  
With open heart, I hear the thrall,  
And heed the sacred, nature’s call.

- Margaret Munro
