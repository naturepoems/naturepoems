Sunlight

Sunlight dances on the dew  
And ignites the fruitful light;  
Gloriously sang the essence  
Of chlorophyll sustained—  
Destined green that reaches forth  
In every crinkle of a leaf.

It flickers on the air,  
Filled with whispers and caresses,  
Blurring the edges of sharpness,  
Molten reflections sway and twist,  
Where this living orb defies  
The passages of time and breath.

— D.H. Lawrence
