The river's flow sings tales of wonder,
  Of journeys drawn from mountain springs,
  It carries dreams through endless valleys,
  While nature hums, and softly sings.
  
  Each stone, a witness to the passage,
  Each current holds a tale to tell,
  In winter's breath or summer's laughter,
  The river flows, a living spell.

- Konstantin Balmont
