Sea Calm

Once I thought
the sea was small,
and smooth like skin.
It grew
with the small waves
and the tiny foam,
  a ripple of air,
softer than the clouds,
so remote, so distant.

The stillness grew
      in the tiny shells,
      in the sponges,
      in the death of water,
      still as the soul.

Yet in it,
     in myself,
     I see the moon.

H.D.
