quote: "The Little House
There are the nose of air,

and a stony heart,
trees grow about the garden.

It is there,

a steady tick of the clock,
that brings the kids

to play,

and the breeze will
bring them back
from the edge of

out in the sun,
ferns will have couched

in this formal place here."

The Little House
There are the nose of air,

and a stony heart,
trees grow about the garden.

It is there,

a steady tick of the clock,
that brings the kids

to play,

and the breeze will
bring them back
from the edge of

out in the sun,
ferns will have couched

in this formal place here.

- William Carlos Williams
