Patterns
I
     "I will give you a pattern."  
I said to my heart.  
My heart,   
     like a child,   
     wanted a pattern.  
     "I will give you a pattern."  
Then there came the breath of a wind  
From the sea.
My heart sank to the depths,  
    and it did not know why,  
And there was only the wind,  
And the pattern of the waves,  
And the grey light that lay on the water.

- Amy Lowell
