I pluck
       The green leaves
               Drenched in dew,
                        A soft,
         Cool memory.
Wrapped in the scent of grass,
I feel the earth,
           Rich and vibrant,
               While the sun
           Breaking through,
                       Kisses my skin.

- Sylvia Plath
