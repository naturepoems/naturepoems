In the dusk of the autumn woods,
Cloaked in their gold and russet,
The air grows cool and thick with dreams,
Higher the stars as the night deepens.

There is a sensuous warmth in the smell,
Of leaves that have fallen and faded,
A whisper of life in its end,
That comes to rest upon my shoulders,
As if to say: all is well.

- Richard Aldington
