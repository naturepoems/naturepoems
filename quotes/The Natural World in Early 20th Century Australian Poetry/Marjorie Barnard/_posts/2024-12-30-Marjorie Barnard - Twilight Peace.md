The twilight brings a hush so deep,
As day gives way to night’s embrace,
In nature’s arms, the world will sleep,
And stars shall twinkle with their grace.

The silver moon, a watchful eye,
Shall guard the dreams of every soul;
With whispered winds that gently sigh,
In restful peace, we feel quite whole.

- Marjorie Barnard
