In the Woods
Awake, my heart, to Nature’s calls!
The whispering winds, the waterfall,
The forest deep, the sunlit glade,
Where tender thoughts in silence fade.

Among the trees I stroll and pause,
To meditate the world’s great laws,
The light that filters through the boughs,
Awakening to the life which bows.

How still the air! how fresh the ground!
In woodland realms, peace can be found;
The beauty here from Nature’s part,
Inspire the soul, revive the heart.

—Charles Tenney Jackson
