The Gulls

The gulls are gone,  
  The summer is shy;  
  But I know their cry,  
 
Dark and blue are the skies  
  Where they flew,  
They flew and they flew,  
  With me far away!  
 
Only the stinging wind  
  And the marsh weeds sway,  
  And the flame of the evening  
 
Is a spark that I see,  
  Soars into the air,  
And back to me.
