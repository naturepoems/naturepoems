The Silence of the Night

Beneath the stars, in velvet night,  
The world transforms, a quiet sight;  
The moon’s soft glow, a beacon bright,  
Embraces dreams until the light.

The creatures hush, in solace sound,  
While shadows breathe on sacred ground;  
In whispered tones, the heart confides,  
When Nature’s peace, the spirit guides.

O Night! Enfold me in your grace,  
Where worries melt, and time finds place;  
In this soft slumber, I take flight,  
In Nature’s arms, I find the night.

- Alphonse de Lamartine
