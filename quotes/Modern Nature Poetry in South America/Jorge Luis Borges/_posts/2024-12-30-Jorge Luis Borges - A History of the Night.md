A History of the Night

The night is a shadow,
An endless horizon of stories
And whispers that linger
Where the light dares not go.

The moon is a solitary guide,
Plucking stars like flowers
From the garden of darkness,
And arranging them in poetry.

Thereâ€™s magic in the void of twilight,
Where every color fades
To hues of forgotten dreams.

Here, the pulse of the world
Feels echoing soft and serene,
As if the earth were sighing
With the weight of twilight.


- Jorge Luis Borges
