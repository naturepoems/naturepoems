Is bulletins all day
From immortality.

The only news I know
Is bulletins all day
From immortality.

In the mouth of a flower.
In the oaks of the forest.

In the caverns of the ocean."

The only news I know
Is bulletins all day
From immortality.

The only news I know
Is bulletins all day
From immortality.

In the mouth of a flower.
In the oaks of the forest.

In the caverns of the ocean.

- William Carlos Williams
