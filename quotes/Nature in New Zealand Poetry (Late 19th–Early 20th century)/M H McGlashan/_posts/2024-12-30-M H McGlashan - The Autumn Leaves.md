The Autumn Leaves

With golden hues the forest glows,
  As autumn days unfold;
The whispering wind a cadence knows,
  Of stories still untold.

The leaves fall softly, one by one,
  Like dreams that slip away;
To dance upon the ground, undone,
  Beneath the fading day.

Each fragile leaf, a tale of grace,
  Of summer’s warm embrace;
Now twirling, fluttering, they trace
  A journey through the space.

In rustling murmurs, secrets shared,
  They speak of time’s embrace;
And as they fall, my heart is bared,
  To nature’s endless grace.

So let the seasons come and go,
  With every passing breeze;
For in the dance of leaves, I know—
  My spirit’s wild release.
