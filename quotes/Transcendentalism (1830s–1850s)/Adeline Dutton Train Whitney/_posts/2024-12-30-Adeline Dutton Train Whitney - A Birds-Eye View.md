A Bird's-Eye View
The clouds sail, the birds ride,
And I sit here at your side,
In the rustling reeds;
My dark spirit flies,
And blind with the blinding glow
Of the vast, outstretching skies;
And my heart yearns, too, you know,
To rise and to flee
From the town’s belching smoke,
To the meadow, the field, the tree;
To the wealth of the wild,
To the blue of the air.
I feel well and strong,
And I know I belong
With the rushing brook,
And the bright-winged bird
That sings from its cheerless nest.
