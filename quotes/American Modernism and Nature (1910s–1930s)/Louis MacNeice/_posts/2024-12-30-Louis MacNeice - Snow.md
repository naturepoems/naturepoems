Snow  

The winds are painting things white  
And this is the most beautiful  
Of all transitions  
To the world.  
Just touch the softness in the air:  
Words slide off the tongue,  
For this snow is never a hard skin  
But a softness that will feed the ground  
It covers and the dreams that glide out through  
The soft clouds hidden in minutes of snow  
Are the stories never told before.  

Nothing is hard in this bright world,  
This is what I have learned from looking  
At snow,  
And that a tree,  
Raindrops, chipped rocks —  
All step along, all  
Glisten with light, as  
Unweighted time now grows and flows.  

The untold stories weave in the soft  
Light such that silence now arises to speak.

Blessed be the winter storms!

- Louis MacNeice
