The Cluster


  The clinging red of the fuchsia,  
  The bending green of the birch,  
  The wild-capped purple of crocus  
  Whose spots would deny him the search;  
  The pale primrose hath shaken  
  The dew from her trumpet, shy;  
  While cautiously looking up  
  Come up a sweet willow, spry.


  The oaken leaf and the heather,  
  The sheaf round by deer crossed;  
  The clouds like a priest by the sun,  
  All silent for loss of their cost;  
  The brooks that are rushing  
  Like sheep down the cliff in a gale,  
  Or breaking alike but obeying  
  The gift falling down like a trail.


  Beneath all the daisies,  
  And crowded about, broken fair,  
  I stand on my levels, and crying  
  Would count the wild flowers all there;  
  While here to my heart with shivering gush  
  The joy there uplifts like song,  
  Had God but sent down for their praise,  
  With gladness to hold them along.
