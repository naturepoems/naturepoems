In the garden of the soul,  
Where the flowers of thought unfold,  
Sweetness and beauty intertwine,  
Natureâ€™s secrets thus consigned.  

What hues our dreams do wear,  
In the silent midnight air,  
The dewdrops dance on leaves so green,  
In whispering breezes, unseen.

- William Ellery Channing
