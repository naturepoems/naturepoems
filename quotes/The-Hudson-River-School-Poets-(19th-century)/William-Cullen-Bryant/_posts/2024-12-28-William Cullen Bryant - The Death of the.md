The Death of the Flowers

The melancholy days are come,
The saddest of the year,
Of wailing winds, and naked woods,
And meadows brown and sear.

Heaped in the hollows of the grove,
The leaves lie withering on the ground,
And the days are cold, and dark, and damp,
And the snow lies across the ground.

The raindrops but call for grace,
And gently borrow their pearls from the night,
And the springtime’s hallowed breath
Is but a sorrow to delight.

The flowers fade, but not forever;
And the wind will come again,
And the warmth of every fading nook,
Will dwell in time’s domain.


- William Cullen Bryant
