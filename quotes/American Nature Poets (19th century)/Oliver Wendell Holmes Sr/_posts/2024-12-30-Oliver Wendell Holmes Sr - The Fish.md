The Fish
I dive where silver schools of fish
Gambol in the quiet pool,
As when the heavens, tinted rich,
Veil the night and startle cool;

I see the flashes in the depths,
Where mirrored colors twine,
Each twistâ€™s a fibrous dream unkept,
In waters pure, sublime.

So gliding on through whirl and wave,
Like dancers in the night,
Those silver forms, a joy to save,
Will quench the heart with light.

- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr
