The Moon

The moon rises 
As sharp as a blade; 
Up on a cool night sky 
It glimmers like a truth,
Through pain and darkness.

Silent long, 
It holds the balance, 
Reflecting the wild;
Cold in every detail, 
A lighthouse in the dark.

Below it moves, 
Fresh grass digs
Into the night, 
Fingers tracing patterns; 
Where life scowls, 
And bloomed.

This restlessness, 
Goes deep into the earth, 
Like life, like death; 
Finding each night's dark share,
This moonâ€™s shadow runs wide, 
And indents the world.

- Ted Hughes
