Beneath the moonlight,
The night blooms with possibility,
A tapestry of stars,
Each twinkle a thought set free,
Dancing in the sky.

The cool air wraps around me,
Filling my lungs with joy,
As I stroll through the field,
The grass whispers stories,
Of dreams forgotten and found.

In this quiet hour,
I find clarity within,
The earth and I connected,
In the gentle pulse of night,
Both alive in the stillness.

- Richard Wright
