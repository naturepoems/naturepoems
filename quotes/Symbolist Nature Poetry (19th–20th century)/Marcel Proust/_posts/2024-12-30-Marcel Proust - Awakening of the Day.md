In the sunrise that blushes, igniting the sky,  
There’s magic unfolding, a moment to fly;  
As the light breaks the darkness, a canvas anew,  
A tapestry woven in pearls of the dew.  

The horizon expands, a promise so bright,  
With the song of the morning that chases the night;  
Each ray of illumination, each golden embrace,  
In the dance of the dawn, I find my true place.  

For in Nature's awakening, my spirit takes flight,  
Emboldened by colors that banish the night;  
With the echo of sunrise, I savor the day,  
In the symphony written where beauty holds sway.

- Marcel Proust
