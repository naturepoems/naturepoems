The Thistle

The thistle stands in the golden glade,
With a brave heart, proud, erect,
Against the dawn, its colors laid,
In the sun’s warm light, it’s perfect.

Each leaf a whisper of fierce intent,
With a bloom that rivals the pride of kings,
In the meadow where the wild winds scent,
The freedom that the daybreak brings.

It holds the courage of a wild heart,
A beacon ‘gainst the common scheme,
In every barbed edge, a state apart,
It blooms, the essence of a dream.


- Mary Webb
