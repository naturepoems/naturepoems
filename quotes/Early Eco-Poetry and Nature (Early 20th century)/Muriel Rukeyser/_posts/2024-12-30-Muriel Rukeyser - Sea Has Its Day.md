The sea has its day,
each night shifts in the stars.
The air knows my name,
a fading lyric of the grass.
Days come to flower,
waiting for the touch of the rains.

What wild cascade do I break on? 
I turn, moving into home.
I feel this generation in life,
this flower held in my hand.

And night falls soft on the field.
I will hold on, abiding,
will not leave the summer long,
will remember the waves of green.
