The Dance of Nature
If I could dance,
I would echo the rise of the hills,
the surge of spring
in all its vibrant greens.
Slowly I would circle,
twirl with the breeze,
a pirouette on the edge of a leaf,
a leap with the deeprunning waters,
and in the end,
like the haze on the horizon,
I would settle back into stillness,
every movement a prayer,
a offering to this sweet earth.



- Wendell Berry
