The Mountains  
   
Majestic heights, your summits reign,  
In glory clad, you pierce the skies,  
With storms that howl upon the plain,  
And silence holds your mystic ties.  
  
With rugged cliffs and valleys deep,  
Within your grasp, the heart is found,  
Where whispers of the secrets keep,  
In sacred grounds, where dreams abound.  
  
O mountains vast, eternal bold,  
In every stone, your stories rise,  
As natureâ€™s canvas, bright and cold,  
In every breath, my spirit sighs.

- Herman Melville
