LADBROKE GROVE

In the middle of the town where the ladies ride
I have a house with a garden, and flowers to hide
From the sun, in a shady bower, by a tree,
That has been a shelter and shade for me,
And I sit in the evening, and drink my tea,
And think what a lot I could do, if I would,
But I don’t do a lot, ‘cause it’s all too good.
The other day a girl came by, went back,
And said it was lovely, and I wish I could pack
My things and come to your house for a day
But I can’t, and it’s all so far once away.

- A E Housman
