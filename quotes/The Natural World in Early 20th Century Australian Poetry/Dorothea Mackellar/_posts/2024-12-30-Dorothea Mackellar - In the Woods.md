In the Woods
Oh, the lovely, lovely bush,  
    How it calls to me once more,
Now the sky is bright and blue,
    And the waves pound on the shore!

I love the scent of the flowers,
    Where the trees grow tall and free,
Where the shadows lie like a curtain,
    And the sunshine filters through to me.

- Dorothea Mackellar
