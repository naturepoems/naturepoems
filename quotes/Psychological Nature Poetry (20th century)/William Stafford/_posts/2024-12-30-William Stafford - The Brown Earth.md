The brown earth calls to us,
   where stones gather
          like quiet children,
    holding history in their hands.
As the sun reaches down,
     the colors blend,
     an artistâ€™s palette,
          a canvas of life.

Open your heart,
     they say in the rustle of leaves,
  befriend the shadows,
        embrace your breath,
   listen to the roots
         pushing through the soil.


- William Stafford
