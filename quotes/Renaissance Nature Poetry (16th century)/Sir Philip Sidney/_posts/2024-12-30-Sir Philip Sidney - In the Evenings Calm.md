In the evening’s calm retreat,  
When the world is soft and sweet;  
Let my heart find peace divine,  
In the colors clear and fine.  
As the stars begin to gleam,  
In their fire, I see a dream.

With the night, my spirit flows,  
In the garden, love bestows  
Every bloom that speaks of grace,  
In the time’s slow, gentle pace.

- Sir Philip Sidney
