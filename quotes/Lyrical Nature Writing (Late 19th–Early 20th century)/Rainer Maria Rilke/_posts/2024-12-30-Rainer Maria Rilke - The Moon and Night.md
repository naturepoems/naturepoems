The Moon and Night

Night unfolds like a flower,
    shimmering with light,
    so deeply does it submerge
    away from the heart of days.

    Want, desire, will becomes
    shadows under the hair of the ancients
    as they lay on the day beneath
    the profound moon that never ends.

—Rainer Maria Rilke
