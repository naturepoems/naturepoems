The Butterfly

A butterfly flits in the flowered air,  
A tiny jewel, winged and rare;  
Dancing lightly from bloom to bloom,  
In all the garden, it finds its room.

With colors bright, and grace it lends,  
In natureâ€™s court, the spirit mends;  
Wherever it lands, it paints the day,  
With beauty, joy, in every way.

- Lydia Sigourney
