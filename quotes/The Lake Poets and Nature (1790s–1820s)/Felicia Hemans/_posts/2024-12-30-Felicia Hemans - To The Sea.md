To The Sea

O mighty sea! thou givest joy divine,
In thy waves I float, in thine arms I sway;
To every sail a whispering line,
As thou dost dance beneath the sun's bright ray.

Furiously dancing, though heart ached so,
Thy stormy heart does rage, yet mellows in peace;
With gentle sway, thy waves do ever bow,
And the earth and ocean join in sweet release.

In tides that rush upon the sandy shore,
In every splash, hope finds its happy song;
Awake the dawn, let my spirit ever soar,
For in thy depths does my dream belong.

O sea! thy calling leaves me ever free,
And in thy bosom, I find joy to be.

—Felicia Hemans
