The Negro Speaks of Rivers

I've known rivers:
Ancient, dusky rivers.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

Ancient, sultry rivers.

My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

I've known rivers:

Far in Africa,
The Congo,

The Nile,

Tending my soul on the banks of the Mississippi.

My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

- Langston Hughes
