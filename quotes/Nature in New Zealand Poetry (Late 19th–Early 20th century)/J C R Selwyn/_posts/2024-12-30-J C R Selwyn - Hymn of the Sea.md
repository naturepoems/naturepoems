Hymn of the Sea
O mighty sea, within thy breast,
A thousand secrets lie at rest,
Thy waves, they sing a siren’s song,
A melody where we belong.

From stormy sky to azure deep,
Thou cradlest dreams, and watchest sleep,
In every crest, a story told,
Of ancient mariners bold and old.

Embrace my soul in your deep blue,
In tempest wild, I’ll sail with you,
For in your depths, I see the light,
A beacon blest in darkest night.

O ocean, grant me strength to steer,
Through every wave, dismiss my fear,
For in your heart, I long to be,
Forever wedded to the sea.

- J C R Selwyn
