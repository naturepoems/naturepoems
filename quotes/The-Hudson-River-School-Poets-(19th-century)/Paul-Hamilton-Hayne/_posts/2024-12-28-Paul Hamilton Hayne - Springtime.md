Springtime

Awake, my heart! the jubilant world goes out
To greet the dewy dawn, the fragrant morn,
Where the crisp air is filled with the joyous shout
Of the returning birds, as they are reborn.

To drink the rapture of the crystal stream,
And trace the wildwood's breath; behold, behold,
All nature clasps the warmth of thy sweet dream,
With emerald leaves and blossoms fair, and bold.

- Paul Hamilton Hayne
