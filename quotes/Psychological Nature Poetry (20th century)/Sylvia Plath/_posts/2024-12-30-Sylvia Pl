The Moon as a Mirror

Flying at night, silvery, 
The moon shows our dear, flawed world. 
Through the shade of hazel trees, we see. 
Underneath, the ground sighs at our feetâ€”  
As silence nurtures our trembling hearts. 
In perfect reflection, we draw near, 
Once more finding peace on our shadowed journeys.

- Sylvia Plath
