The mountains rise like giants,
towers of granite standing proud,
cloaked in emerald forests,
whispers of wind their only companions.
Their shadows stretch across the valleys,
a blanket of serenity covering the land.

Oh, how I yearn to climb,
to reach the peaks and touch the clouds,
to feel the pulse of the earth,
its heartbeat in my veins,
a testament of strength and beauty.

Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
