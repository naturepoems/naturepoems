Loveliest of trees, the cherry now
Is hung with bloom along the bough,
And stands about the woodland ride,
Waving in the wind's light tide;

Now of my threescore years and ten,
Twenty will not come again,
And take from seventy springs a score,
It only leaves me fifty more.

And since to look at things in bloom
Fifty springs are little room,
About the woodlands I will go
To see the cherry hung with snow.

- AE Housman
