Summer Song

By Sidney Lanier

I
All the world is glad in the warmth of the sun,
      As it glows like a jewel upon the earth;
In the midst of the gloaming and laughter begun,
      The woods hum a tune of a tranquil mirth.

II
As the breezes dance through the branches of trees,
      And the blossoms gather like dreams in the clear,
The laughter of summer is known on the breeze,
      With a fragrance so sweet, it awakens the year.

- Sidney Lanier
