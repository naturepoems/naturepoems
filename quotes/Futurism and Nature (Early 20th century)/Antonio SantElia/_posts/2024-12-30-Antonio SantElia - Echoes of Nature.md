Echoes of Nature
In the quiet, we hear the sound,
Of natureâ€™s heart, a rhythmic pound.
Whispers echo through the trees,
A symphony on gentle breeze.

Every rustle, a tale to tell,
Of life and love where spirits dwell,
In nature's arms, we find our song,
A bond with earth, forever strong.


- Antonio SantElia
