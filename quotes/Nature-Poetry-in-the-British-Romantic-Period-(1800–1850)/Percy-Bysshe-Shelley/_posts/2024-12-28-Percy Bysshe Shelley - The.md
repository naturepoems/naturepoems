The Fugitives
I
The glade is still, the waters roar without, 
While above the rushing stream
The leaves and flowers dance and play,
Their gleams of white and freed delight.

II
And ye, the guests of space,
Shuttle like flowers through the endless night,  
Through love to flowers heavenward,
As the waves roll on the deep, delighted in their flight.

So we reflect and twine
Sweet, tender-hearted lines,
So never lost to Nature's face
Be firm with colors bright.


- Percy Bysshe Shelley
