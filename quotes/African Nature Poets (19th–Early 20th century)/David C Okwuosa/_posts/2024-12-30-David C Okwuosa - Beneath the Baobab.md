Beneath the Baobab

Underneath the baobab’s shade,
Memories linger of times stayed,
Stories of ancestors, whispers of dawn,
In its roots, our history is drawn.

With branches wide as the sky is deep,
The baobab watches while we dream and sleep,
Guarding the tales of a world long past,
In its presence, our moments are cast.

- David C Okwuosa
