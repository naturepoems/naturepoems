The Voice

I left, as lost she dwelleth here,
And sought for voice in skyscape clear,
When close upon dusk's gentle stroke,
A whisper stays where solemn folk

Pass, ever yearning, tread the vale,
To find the life in grit and hail,
Thus bid I forth, 'neath moonlit throng,
Hearing the silence melt in song. 

For now the wind has roused a thought,
Which knows, as if in destined ought,
That every heart may wait a while,
Behind its eyes to see and smile.

- Thomas Hardy
