Nature's Carnival
Gnarled trees with crooked noses
Bend to hear the secrets of the wind,
Mirthful animals chuckle
As butterflies brandish elegant gowns.
Sleek foliage wraps
The limbs of trees
Like soft caresses over yawning castles. 

The sun blinks
Through the jolly leaves,
Casting shafts of golden laughter
That paint the ground,
Where beetles crawl, and spikes of grass rise.
The earth twirls like a child,
Whirling in a joy so wild.

- Hugo Ball
