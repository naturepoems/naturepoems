The Moose

From the bus, it was a hot, dry afternoon; 
the sun glittered on stark asphalt.
The bus came onto a high, dry hill;  
all at once we were surrounded  
by soft, moving woods.  

Then we were near a road,  
and suddenly loomed large  
a moose.  
He was standing there with four  
trees behind him, quite close,
to where we were; 
he raised his head.

The trees tinkled like tuning forks—
trees that had risen out of dreams.

Nobody could see.  The moose weighed down  
the world: the land bent to ownership;  
a sound came forward,  
a  sound lighter than air.  
I saw it.”  

Then, two or three others swarmed in,
we could not tell.
There were shrill, light shrieks, or spats or moans  
at the smearing road; 
the moose was gone.

Each made its own  
small long loss, 
each hurried on to mark.
In his leaving,  
a hollow hood rose dark, and I thought  
that I heard him say,  
yawning,  

“Another secret!  
You startled my day;  
that’s certainly  
the end of it.”  
They quickly hung back  
into the woods,
a fable’s place—from listening.

And the whole world sighed  
with a heavy sense
of hurry towards nowhere.
