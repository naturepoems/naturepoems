River Song
The river flows in silver gleam,
A winding path through wood and stone;
Its gentle laugh, a soothing dream,
A voice of nature, soft and lone.

Each ripple tells a tale of time,
Of mountains high and valleys deep;
Its melody, a rhythmic rhyme,
Calls forth the souls that yearn to weep.

- Ilya Ehrenburg
