SONG OF THE PINE

Oh, the pine that tosses in the breeze,
With its green attire so rich to see,
It murmurs tales through the rustling leaves,
Of ages past and eternity.

Its needles dance in the sunlit air,
They twinkle secrets, they sing in mirth;
For in that tree there's a spirit fair,
And a voice that echoes beneath the earth.

How often have I sought to share
The wisdom that the pine-tree imparts;
The lessons hidden in the prayer
Of wind and wood that fill our hearts.

Let the pines lift their joyful song,
As guardians of the world's sweet grace;
For in their branches we belong,
And find our rest in Nature's face.

- Thomas Bracken
