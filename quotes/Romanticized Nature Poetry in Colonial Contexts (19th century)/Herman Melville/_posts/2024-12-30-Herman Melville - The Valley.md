The Valley
In valleys deep where shadows lay,
A tranquil pulse, soft whispers sigh,
Where wildflowers seek the light of day,
And dreams unfold beneath the sky.

The winding streams, like laughter free,
Do sparkle in the morning glow,
As nature's breath in harmony,
Unites each heartbeat with the flow.

A sanctuary, sweet and pure,
Where every heart shall find its song,
With every petal, hope is sure,
As life and love are ever strong.

May every traveler seek the way,
To wander through these fields of grace,
For in the valley’s sweet ballet,
A love transcends in vast embrace.

— Excerpt from "The Valley" (not an actual poem of Melville)

- Herman Melville
