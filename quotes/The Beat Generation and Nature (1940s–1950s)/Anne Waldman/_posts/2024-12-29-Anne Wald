The soft book of leaves,
The surreality of landscapes,
Pines pierced by stars’ shimmering,
They breathe—a language like soft silk,
A brush upon the heart.
- Lapping at the edges,
Where the forest meets the human rhythm.

Spruce and cedar,
Breath of the land, holding time,
In their black green embrace,
Crimson sunsets suffusing
Into evenings that linger,
Marking a boundary that curves
Where whispers of owl and night unfold.

A tight space cradling wonders,
And I become the lost stories,
Plucking hours from dark—
Sound shifts lightly in reflections,
The heart listens to its own echo,
And we wander companioned by moonlight,
Interlaced with threads of spirit—
An animate heart in nature.

Meet me there. Forever.

- Anne Waldman
