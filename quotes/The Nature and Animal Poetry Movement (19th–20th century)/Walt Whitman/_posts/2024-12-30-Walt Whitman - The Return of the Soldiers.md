The Return of the Soldiers

When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom’d,
And the great star early droop’d in the western sky in the night,
I mourned—and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring.

Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring,
Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west,
And thought of him I loved.

All went to seed—only a few said, "We still rise."
We scatter solid seeds across the earth, and bring the spring,
Absorbing the quiet Earth.


- Walt Whitman
