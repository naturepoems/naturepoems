When the dusk creeps softly, with shadows that glide,  

And the night wraps its arms in a blanket of stars,  

I whisper my secrets to the moon as my guide,  

In this world of enchantment, unburdened by scars.


The trees stand in witness, the winds are a song,  

While I dance with the spirits of earth and the night,  

In the company of silence, where I truly belong,  

Nature, my refuge, my soulâ€™s pure delight.

- Alice Dunbar-Nelson
