Whispers of the River

Flowing gently, a silver thread,  
Whispers of the river spread.  
Through cypress knees and willows weep,  
Memories linger, secrets keep.
  
The current hums a timeless song,  
As banks of mud and soft grass throng.  
Life teems beneath the waters clear,  
Nature’s echo, forever near.


- Halfred Lee
