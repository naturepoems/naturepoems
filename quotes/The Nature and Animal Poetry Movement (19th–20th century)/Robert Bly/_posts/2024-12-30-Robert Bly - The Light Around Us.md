The Light Around Us

When the sun rises in the east,
It blows the crows off my fence
And I see—night is a wide empty page,
Snow falls across it, white and silent.
The light comes in,
And I step to meet it,  
My shadow stumbles  
Just behind me,
Long and leaning, as a memory  
Whispers in the shape of a whisper.

In that light, the trees seem to pause  
And nod—a question lies  
In their dark branches;  
They lean gently towards me,  
Waiting to be understood,
The shadows answer the light.


- Robert Bly
