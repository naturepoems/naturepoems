The azure sky and verdant field unite,
Like lover’s hands that softly intertwine.
As by the stream I wander, heart in flight—
What bounteous beauty blesses earth's design!

The blossoms sway in harmony of hue—
This fragrant art, the canvas of our days,
To paler clouds that drift and fleeting grew,
And cast their glory on the moistened bays.

How nature's voice doth call—to find our own,
In rustling leaves, in streams that sing enthralled,
In quietude where each soft sound is sown,
The spirit’s echo speaks, our hearts are awed.

In every step upon this boundless way,
A sanctity where night and dawn converge.
