On the horizon, dawn ignites the sky,
a fiery embrace, warm and radiant.

The world awakens from its dark reverie,
a gentle sigh of life renewed.

Nature stretches its limbs in morning's light,
a refreshing breath inhaled from the earth.

Let the beauty of new beginnings unfold,
with every sunrise, a canvas anew.

- Kate Bush
