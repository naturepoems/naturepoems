Upon the hill, the daisies play,
With radiant smiles to greet the day,
In cluster bright, they shout with glee,
A tribute to the earth so free.

The morning dew, a silken lace,
Adorns their crowns with fleeting grace,
In quiet moments, one can find,
The beauty of the world, aligned.

- Anna Brigadere
