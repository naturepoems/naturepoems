The Old Tree

Knotted and wise,
With branches spread wide,
You cradle the past,
In the arms of your pride.

Through storms you have weathered,
Through seasons you've seen,
A guardian of time,
In a landscape serene.

Oh tree of the ages,
With roots running deep,
You stand as a beacon,
In the shadows we keep.

- John Thompson
