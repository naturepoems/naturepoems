Beneath the vast sky, stars gleam bright,
Guiding the weary home through the night.
The moon whispers secrets to the serene sea,
In this dome of wonder, I long to be free.

Echoes of nightingales fill the air,
A melody woven with delicate care.
The breeze tells tales of the days gone by,
In nature’s vast wonder, my spirit can fly.


- Siddhartha Giggs
