The Rainbow
The sky, a vast expanse so clear,  
Doth arch its colors all so dear!
The rain has swept, as if to show,
The beauty that in silence flow.

So smiling bright the rainbow bends,  
With hues that nature’s hand extends,  
To fill our hearts with wondrous sight,  
And wrap us in the dream of light.

- Felicia Hemans
