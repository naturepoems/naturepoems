The Wishing Tree

A tree, a tree, a wishing tree!  
Beneath its shade I long to be;  
Where whispering leaves and bending boughs  
Offer their secrets to the plowes.

Under the wide and azure sky,  
Where steady clouds are sailing high,  
I cast my thoughts on dreams and hopes,  
As sunlight weaves its goldenropes.

Oh, let me sit where breezes play,  
And hear the joyous birds at play;  
The world’s tumult will fade away,  
And peace enfold me, come what may.

The flowers nodding at my feet,  
With fragrance rich, I gladly greet;  
Each petal sings of nature’s worth,  
In her sweet bosom lies my mirth.

- Hartley Coleridge
