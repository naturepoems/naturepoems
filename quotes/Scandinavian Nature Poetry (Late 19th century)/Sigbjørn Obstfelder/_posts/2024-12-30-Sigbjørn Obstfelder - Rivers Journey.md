The river flows onward, a silver ribbon,
Through valleys and meadows, a journey it makes;
With each twist and turn, new stories unfold,
In its timeless passage, the heart aches and breaks.

Beneath the wide bridge, where echoes abide,
The waters reflect what the world cannot see;
In this dance of nature, I whirl and I sway,
Finding peace in the flow, as the river sets free.

- Sigbjørn Obstfelder
