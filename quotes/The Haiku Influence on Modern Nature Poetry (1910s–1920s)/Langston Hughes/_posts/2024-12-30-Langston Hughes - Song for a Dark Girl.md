Song for a Dark Girl
Way Down South in Dixie,
  Break the heart of me.
They hung my black young lover
  To a tree.

The tree was all gold leaves
  and the sky was blue,
And the river ran deep
  for only the view.

The night is dark and silent,
  With the stars all aglow,
Hush! the leaves are creeping
  Where the heartbeats flow.

- Langston Hughes
