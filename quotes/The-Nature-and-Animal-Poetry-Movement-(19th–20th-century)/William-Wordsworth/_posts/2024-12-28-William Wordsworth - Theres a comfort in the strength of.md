There’s a comfort in the strength of love;
'Twill make a thing endurable,
If such it can be, and shall be love,
Whose strength hath bred sweet pain, sublime;
All the beauty of nature, love could not lack.
In the forest, far away—
The honeycomb spun from my heart’s delight,
As the honey-sweet notes throng the woody shore.

- William Wordsworth
