Ode to the Sky

Above me stretches the infinite blue,
A canvas brushed by the hands of the day.
Cotton clouds float, transforming in view,
In the blink of an eye, they drift away.

Each dawn, a new portrait, a shifting hue,
Where sunlight spills in golden streams of light.
The stars at night, the moonâ€™s gentle coo,
Awaken my dreams, in the tapestry of night.

Oh, sky, vast arena, forever unfurled,
You cradle our sorrows, our joys, our despair.
In your endless embrace, we find our world,
The boundless panorama we long to declare.

- Pablo Neruda
