To a Waterfowl
Whither, midst falling dew,
   While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,
   Far down the vista of the west,
   A solitary bird takes flight.

High in the arching dome above,
   Its melody breaks the silence deep,
   A tender note that bids us love,
   Nature's heart is ours to keep.


- James Russell Lowell
