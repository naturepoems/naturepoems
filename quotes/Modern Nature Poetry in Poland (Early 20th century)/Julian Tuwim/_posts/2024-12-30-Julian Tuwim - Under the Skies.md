The skies stretch above, vast and blue,
Clouds drift lazily, soft and white,
A canvas for dreams yet to bloom,
In the gentle kiss of sunlight.

Fields of grain dance with the wind,
A golden wave flowing in time,
In the chorus of moments, life calls,
Every breath a simple rhyme.

Natureâ€™s melody, a soft embrace,
Weaving the fabric of all things true,
In the heart of the earth, we find ourselves,
Connected through the skies so blue.

- Julian Tuwim
