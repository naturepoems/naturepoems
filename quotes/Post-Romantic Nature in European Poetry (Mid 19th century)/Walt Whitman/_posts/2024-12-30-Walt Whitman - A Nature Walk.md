I wander in the windswept moors,
Through meadows rich with life's embrace,
Each moment a tapestry unspooled,
The heartbeats of time merge with grace.

Each blade of grass, a tiny poet,
Writing tales of the day's warm glow,
In the solitude of nature's cradle,
The world finds peace in the blow.

A shared breath with mountains towering,
A sigh shared with the rustling trees,
For here in nature's open bosom,
Tranquility reigns like a breeze.

- Walt Whitman
