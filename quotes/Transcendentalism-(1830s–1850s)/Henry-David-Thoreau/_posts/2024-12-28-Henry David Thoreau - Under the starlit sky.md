Under the starlit sky,  
Where the cosmos lingers bright,
I pursue a dream unchained,
In the meadow's embrace,
I dance upon the grass,
As the night unfolds,  
A tapestry of whispers,
From hearts and wings,
Each breath a note,
In nature's symphony,
In celestial aliveness,
The universe breathes,
And I, a mere part of it,  
Converse with the infinite.

- Henry David Thoreau
