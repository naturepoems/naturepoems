Lines to a Waterfowl

Whither, ‘midst falling dew,
While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,
Far—the beauty fades and the shade falls,
Ah! Horizon! O what can guide me to that shore?

I am all alone. I mourn,
The world I knew has gone, and all my best return
To silence, dust, and darkness, and there is naught left
Of wonder, save through shadows, pursued by flies.

O wanderer, O faithful guide,
You direct me through the sunbeams all alone.
And as the waters flow beneath the stars,
I learn the ways of joy, that no one can destroy.

And thus I stand, with darkness coming on,
My heart that does not falter in its beats, to pray
That death will hold no reign upon the waters,
As they carry the light back into a single day.

- William Cullen Bryant
