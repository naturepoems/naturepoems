Thou art, indeed, divine. For when I see
Thy laughter breaking like the crisp of dawn,
Upon the earth's brave face, and where light's song
Hath weaved webs of mirth where shadows flee,
O! How can I not lose all thought of thee?
For time concedes to thee where hopes are drawn,
And Earth's deep chair is by thy heart alone.

   The rising sun within its dazzling ray
   Plays with the strands of creation as it glows;
   And in such radiant joy tears come and play.

   For shades are long, the green of life will rash,
   And all things bright will fade when earth then goes,
   Thinking but of eternal sunlight's dash.

â€” The Laughter of Dawn

- William Shakespeare
