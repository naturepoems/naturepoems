A Farewell

I
  In the green house, creeping vines,
     In the pale cold autumn glows,
     What buxom summer lingers through?
     I may not with-hold my heart from love.

II
  The leaves have flung their colours down,
     Gathered from flowers that went down with them.
     I do not want any marvels sweet as these;
     I wish not to recall at midnight, shone a dream until dawn.

III
  I bid farewell, yet I have this to keep...

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
