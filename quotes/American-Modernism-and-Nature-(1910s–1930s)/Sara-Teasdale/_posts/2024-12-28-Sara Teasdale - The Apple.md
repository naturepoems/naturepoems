The Apple Tree

When apples hang like rosy dreams,
I think of love, so sweetly true;
Nature enchants in gentle beams,
Her bounty gifts and whispers too.

In an orchard filled with grace,
I find a world that spins so slow;
Among the trees, I seek your face,
Where blossoms bloom and breezes blow.

- Sara Teasdale
