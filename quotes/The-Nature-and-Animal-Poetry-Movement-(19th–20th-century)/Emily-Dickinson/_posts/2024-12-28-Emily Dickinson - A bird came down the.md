A bird came down the walk;
He did not know I saw;
He bit an angle-worm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw.

And then he drank a dew
From a convenient grass;
And then hopped sidewise to the wall
And he gave me a snare

I fancied he was quite a fair
And, for me, as well,
I loved him not too much
I must not let him know

And I did not let him know.


- Emily Dickinson
