Beneath the vast skies where the larks swoop and glide,  

In the lush open meadows where wild clovers bloom,  

I lose all my cares to the breeze's soft pride,  

And the sweet perfume that the lilacs consume.


Nature, infinite canvas, a vision divine,  

Encircles my heart in her rich, vibrant hue,  

Each moment in wonder, each moment, a sign,  

In her arms, ever precious, forever anew.

- Alice Dunbar-Nelson
