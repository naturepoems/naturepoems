Cradle Song  

Sweet sleep, with soft downy is resting;  
Soft, bright-eyed and kindly caressing;  
Sleep while I hum to my dulcet corrosion,  
Sing soft, my little one, hum, much emotion.  

Wild flowers grow within the far vale;  
Your golden hair with bright petals twine;  
While my love’s power does never fail,  
Sweet lullabies that caress and shine.

- William Blake
