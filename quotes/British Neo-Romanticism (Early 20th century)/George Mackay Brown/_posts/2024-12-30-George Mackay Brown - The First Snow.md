The First Snow

The first snow falls, a soft whisper,
Blanketing the world in muted tones,
Each flake a delicate promise,
A gift from the winter sky,
Transforming the familiar into magic.

Children rush outside, laughing wild,
Creating angels, their joy alight,
As memories swirl like the falling snow,
Carving moments into the stillness,
Captured in the tranquil breath of night.


- George Mackay Brown
