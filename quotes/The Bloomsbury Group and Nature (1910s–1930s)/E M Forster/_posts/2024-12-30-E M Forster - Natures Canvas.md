Nature paints her subtle canvases,
Where the wild flowers sway and bend,
In the whispering wind, the deep philosophies,
Of a world reluctant to pretend.

With each season's changing palette,
Spring's blush, summer's golden glow,
Autumn's amber hues and winter's chalice,
Life finds rhythms that ebb and flow.

- E M Forster
