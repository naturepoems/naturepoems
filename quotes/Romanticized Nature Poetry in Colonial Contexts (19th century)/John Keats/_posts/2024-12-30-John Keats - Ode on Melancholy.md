Ode on Melancholy

No, no! go not to Lethe, neither twist
   Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous tear,
   Leaves at the bottom of a fountainâ€™s mist;
   The red-leav'd sorrow, and the begging hand done.

But when the blood is warm, and is free to move,
   And the spirit alive, to the earth already,
   The stars, the dew upon the flower, the brood of air
Without disturbing whilst she sings  
Of the bee's swift body of love, and glory
And inspire the people to susurrus, and swell as they will,  
Alas! not when dead they shall be still.

- John Keats
