The Gay Life
The world is so full of beauty,
Stories of joy wherever we go,
In the rise of the hills and the valleys
Of light and of laughter—  our debts—
To the thy and the she,
The crest and the vale
For the freedom we’ll gain by the silence
That never shall fail.
    
O, the spirit’s close freedom!
And I drift out of sight
In the hands of the water  
Where the days will not blight  
The old dreams—and still
Among shadows they dwell.
A simple sweet curse,
And all tales of the earth.

- Dorothea Mackellar
