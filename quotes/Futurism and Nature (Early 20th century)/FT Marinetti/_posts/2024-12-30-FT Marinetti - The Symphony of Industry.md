Let us swim through the sugarcane,
Tasting the quicksilver sweetness,
Where wild fervor meets the unshackled sky,
Natureâ€™s abandon in full bloom!

Each grain of earth is vibrant,
Every flower is a burst of sound,
Let the metal rust and blur of machines,  
Be the echo of life within this paradise.

In the heart of the machines, we thrive,
Alive in frenzy, both mechanized and wild,
A break in the rigidness,
From the chorus of nature's profound beauty!

- FT Marinetti
