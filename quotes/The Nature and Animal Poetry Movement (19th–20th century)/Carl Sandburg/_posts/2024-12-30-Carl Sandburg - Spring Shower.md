Who knows the freshness of the first spring shower,
a gentle stream that gives life,
risk the dark night; carry the warmth  
of seasons in bloom  
at the foot of a tree listening.

On the quiet lake, the stars become one,
silently, softly, the heart speaks,
whispers the bright moon—as she dips her head,
touching the water, kissing the soul.

- Carl Sandburg
