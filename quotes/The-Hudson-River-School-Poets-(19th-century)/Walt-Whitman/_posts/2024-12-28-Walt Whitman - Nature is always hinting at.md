Nature is always hinting at us,
It is never quite the same;
From the mountains, I hear her calling,
From the depths of the trees I find her name,

Each bird, each element, a story to tell,
In the shimmer of a flower's embrace,
The silence of the moss, or the ocean’s roar,
In the dance of the shadows, I embrace.

I join in the song of the wild,
For I am of her essence, her breath,
And in the bosom of nature, I glean the truth,
For even a leaf's fall speaks of life and of death.

— From "Leaves of Grass"

- Walt Whitman
