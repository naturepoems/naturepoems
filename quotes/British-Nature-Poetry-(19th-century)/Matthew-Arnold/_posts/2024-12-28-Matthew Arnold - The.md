The Sea

The sea is very still tonight,
I see the sails of silence glide,
And hear the waves, a soft delight,
As they return to kiss the tide.

The stars look down so clear and bright,
A fresh light plays upon the sea,
The moon takes on a tender flight,
My heart is lost in this harmony.

Ah, life seems gently at its peak,
In this sweet moment, oh, so rare!
And yet, my soul is far too weak
To grasp the wisdom tossed in air.

O perfect night! Let us remain,
In whispers soft, let silence flow,
For here, what's near will ever stain,
I long to feel the night winds blow.

- Matthew Arnold
