The King of the Mountain

There stood the great mountain, proud and unyielding; his peak touched the heavens with a testament of granite wearing the sky like a crown, a fortress of the wild, holding court over the valleys and the creatures that spun in its shadow, awed by the strength of its presence, reminding all that in nature lies the true sovereign.

- Jack London
