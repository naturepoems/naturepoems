On first looking into Chapman’s Homer

Much have I travelled in the realms of gold,
And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
Round many western islands have I been
Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.

Often I arched my back and snoozed,  
A tossed coin merry misshapen to it’s home.
Yet did I never swallow so much light  
As through his words, with greater strength bestowed. 
It's beauty is so grand, and thou dost shine  
As ancient Greek would beat all at matron’s crown.

— On first looking into Chapman’s Homer

- John Keats
