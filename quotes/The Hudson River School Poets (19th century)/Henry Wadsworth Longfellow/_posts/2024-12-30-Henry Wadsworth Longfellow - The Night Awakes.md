The gladness of the night awakens,  
While stars alight in silver shades,
With gentle whispers in the dark corridors,
Those solemn holds where stillness waits.

I listen closely, soft and sweet,  
The sighs of winds like ancient songs;
The trees shall sway and bend to greet,  
The melody that time prolongs.


- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
