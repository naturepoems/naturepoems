The Flower's Song

In gardens bright, the flowers bloom,
With colors bold, dispelling gloom.
Each petal whispers soft and sweet,
In natures’ choir, their song’s complete.

The rose declares a love profound,
While daisies dance upon the ground.
And every blossom’s fragrant breath,
Carries the essence of life and death.

So pause awhile and stoop to see,
The hidden world of purity.
For in each flower, life’s wishings play,
In blooms that greet the break of day.
