The breezes of the world, breathe soft through me,  
Like dreams of a fading evening,  
When the night slips in with a silence,  
And moonlight dances on the sea.
  
Stars, with their trembling light  
Keep watch over the blossoming fields,  
While the heart, like a wandering bird,  
Finds solace in the whispering leaves.


- Friedrich Hölderlin
