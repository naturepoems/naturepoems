The river flows,
a constant companion,
a storyteller weaving
through valleys and hills,
a mirror to the sky,
a testament of time.
Each bend a tale,
each ripple a laugh,
a journey that echoes,
as it carves out the landscape.
Nature takes and gives,
with grace and wisdom,
a reminder that life
is an ongoing stream of love.
