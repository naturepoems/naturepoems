Fall

The autumn woods are ripe with all their hues,  
As nature draws her sweeping breath of fire,  
The leaves, like jeweled banners, dance and muse,  
A symphony of colors that inspire.

The harvest bounty spills across the fields,  
It shines like gold beneath the fading sun;  
With bounty given, nature gently wields,  
Her tender hands, uniting everyone.

O Autumn, in thy beauty lies the peace,  
Of life resuming earth's eternal flow;  
Thy charm hath power to make all sorrows cease,  
As love and warmth into our hearts, they sow.

- Archibald Lampman
