The Wildflower

Hidden in the bushes' fold,
Wondrous in its light and hue,
Grows the wildflower, sweet and bold,
Where the skies seem bright and true.

Let the heart feel nature's grace,
In the fragrance, pure and free,
As it dances, time and place,
‘Neath the shade of gum and tree.

Here, the whispers softly chime,
Of the breezes’ gentle flight,
In the wildflower, steeped in rhyme,
Nature paints in colors bright.

- Henry Lawson
