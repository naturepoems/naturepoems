Summer Solstice

The sun ascends in broad display,
As nature sings upon the day;
With blooming flowers, and skies of cheer,
The summer solstice draws quite near.

Through every dawn where beauty stirs,
I find my heart in gentle whirs;
And as the light expands with grace,
All time is lost in nature's face.

- Dorothy Wordsworth
