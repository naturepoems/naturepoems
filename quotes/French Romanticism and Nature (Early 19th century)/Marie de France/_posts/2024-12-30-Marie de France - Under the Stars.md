The stars align in perfect form,
As night unfolds her velvet shroud.
In silence wrapped, we find the warm,
The dreams beneath the heavens bowed.

In natureâ€™s gaze, we seek the truth,
As planets dance and spirits rise.
With every choice, we find the proof,
Of love that shines beyond the skies.

- Marie de France
