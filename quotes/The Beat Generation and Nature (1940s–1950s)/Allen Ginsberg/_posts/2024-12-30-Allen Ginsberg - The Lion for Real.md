The Lion for Real

Here we have a lion!
        No, it's only
            
the wind, blowing
        through the trees.
How easily
    I could mistake it!

            The wind, like
    claws,
digging into the earth.
The trees bend,
    an older song calls us
            forward
into the wild, into
    the beating heart.
