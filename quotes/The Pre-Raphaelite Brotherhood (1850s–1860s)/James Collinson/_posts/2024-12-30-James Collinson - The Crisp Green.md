The Crisp Green


  I cling to the crisp green of the world,  
  Where tulips plunge with faith so near,  
  I wonder and tremble the dreams unhurled,  
  As the pines are combing with clear —  
  Ah! dear, how gently I catch that sigh  
  That loud tones from sorrows flood —  
  In each forest walk I feel you pass by  
  As the half concealed hush of the wood.
