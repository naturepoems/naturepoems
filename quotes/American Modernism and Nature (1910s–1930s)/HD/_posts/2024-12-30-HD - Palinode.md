Palinode

 
Was it the wind
  that swept through the clover,
blown like memory,
    from my gardening dream?
  A breath, a wisp,
a hold and release 
a floating leaf,
    confounded by my tears.

 Ah, longing springs
   my heart,
   a quaver unseen  
      sent forth in spring’s hunger.
  This sweet singing past,
   between the vapors,
  I curl around,
  a dusky dusk. 
  O do you know me?
     —H.D.
