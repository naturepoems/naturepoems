The Song of the Lark

On the whispering hills of my heart she sings,
The lark—her song a silver arch,
Pulsing with the day’s soft beginnings,
And weaving through the world’s sweet march.

Through crowded boughs, where the softest dew lies,
With each note like a pearl of spring,
She flutters high, like hope which climbs the skies,  
Delivering words that the heart must bring.
—Sidney Lanier
