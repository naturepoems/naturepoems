The Ocean

Endless blue, the vast expanse,
Where sky meets sea in soft embrace;
In wave and curl, a timeless dance,
A whispered song, an ocean's grace.

The salt-kissed air, a breezy caress,
Where dreams are tossed on rolling tide;
Eternal secrets, deep and blessed,
In every surge, the world’s abide.

So stand upon the sandy shore,
And feel the rhythm of the sea;
For in this beauty, we explore,
The pulse of life, the wild and free.

- Helen M B M Maud
