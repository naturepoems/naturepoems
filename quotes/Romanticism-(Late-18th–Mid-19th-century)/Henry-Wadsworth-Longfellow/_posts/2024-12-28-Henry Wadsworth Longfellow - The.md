The Landlord
By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

Come and cheer the land beneath,  
Come, and breathe upon its soil;  
Kiss the branches of the trees,  
And say, I am not for toil;  
O noble land, I long for thee,  
As morning’s rays unfurl;  
I am in love with every leaf,  
In every flower and pearl;  
The air swathes to creation’s grace,  
The rain that brings the joy!
