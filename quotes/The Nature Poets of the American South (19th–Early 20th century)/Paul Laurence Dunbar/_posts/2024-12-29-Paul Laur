The Forest in the Rain

The rain is falling all around,
It falls on field and tree;
It rains on the umbrellas here,
And on the ships at sea.


The Butterfly

A butterfly, with golden wings,
Danced lightly through the sunny air,
Upon a blossom's edge it clings,
And flits from flower to blooming fair.


In the Shade of the Trees

In the shade of the trees,
A sweet breeze comes blowing,
And the rustle of leaves
Is the music of knowing.


Magnolia

O magnolia, fair and white,
Thy perfume like a heavenly light,
Drifts on the air both soft and sweet,
Where love and beauty gently meet.


An Evening Song

The sun is going down,
The shadows fall so deep;
The day will soon be gone,
But nature's joy we keep.


Evening in the Woods

The nodding trees are still,
The birds are hushed and shy;
The twilight softly spills
Its purple in the sky.


A Summer's Night

When the moon is shining bright,
And the stars twinkle in the dew,
Oh, the cool and lovely night,
Is a time I love for you.


The River

O rushing river, gay and free,
You laugh and leap in your delight,
You wind around the land so free,
In the cool embrace of night.


After the Rain

The rain has gone, the sun is bright,
The flowers lift their heads in cheer;
Now all the world is pure and right,
With nature smiling bright and clear.


The Quiet Wood

In the quiet wood at twilight,
Where the shadows rest so deep,
I hear the whispers of the night,
And hush my soul to sleep.


Dawn's Awakening

When dawn comes creeping up the hill,
And chases shadows from the day,
The world awakens, calm and still,
In the soft light, all at play.


Wilderness

The wildness all around me sings,
In every rustling leaf I hear,
The heartbeat of the earth that brings
The whisper of a world so dear.


The Song of the Grass

The grass is singing in the breeze,
A silent song to sun and rain;
It dances lightly with the trees,
And knows no hurt, nor fear of pain.


The Wind

I feel the wind upon my face,
It tells me tales of distant lands;
In every gust, I find a trace
Of nature's heart and loving hands.


The Nightingale

A nightingale sings soft and low,
Its melody a soothing balm,
In every note, a love we know,
That wraps the world in peaceful calm.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
