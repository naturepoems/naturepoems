In the time of the old Norsemen the world was full of real flowers,
And auguries were drawn from the song of nightingales,
And when they heard thunder, they prayed, and saw their prophecies fulfilled.
The thunder, of course, is only the sound of their praying but they did not know.
In the time of the old Norsemen the Universe was filled with gods,
And the homes of men were filled with wonders.

- Henry Adams
