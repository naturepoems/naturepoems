From "Preludes"

The winter evening settles down
With the smell of steaks in passageways.
Six o'clock.
The sheds are lined in the streets with the
Questions. 
And the grip of distant sounds
Comes closer to the soul of the city.

The oily weather clouded
The darkened streets where fed only light
Grows in a body. 
A dim, circulating flame, 
And a place where the sky,
Bleeding into grey, emerges to 
Where deep darkness curls yearly 
On its breast, softening like old night-dwellings.

There 
Is a light, loosened from the day.

- T S Eliot
