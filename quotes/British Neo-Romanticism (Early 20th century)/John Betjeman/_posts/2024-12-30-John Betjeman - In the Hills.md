The rolling hills, a green expanse,
Inviting me to take a chance,
To wander far, where the larks do fly,
In the soft embrace of the azure sky.

Each note that flutters, drawing me there,
A symphony of natureâ€™s care,
Where beauty waits in every glade,
And all my worries slowly fade.

- John Betjeman
