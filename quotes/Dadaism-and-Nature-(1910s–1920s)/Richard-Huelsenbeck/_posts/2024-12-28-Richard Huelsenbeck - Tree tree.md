Tree, tree!  
Beneath the lilac,  
the wind blows quietly,  
whispers long forgotten—  
it curls around  
tender leaves  
like a lover's breath.

Glistening dew  
turns into diamonds,  
glistening on the foliage,  
I hear the sun sing,  
its golden fingers stretching  
towards the celestial roof.  

What joy, disseminated  
in the soft crickets’ song,  
a chorus,  
avant-garde,  
resonating through time—  
a symphony of roots!

Is life but a tender vibration?  
Or a shiver of colors?  
Here, I stand,  
normally uprooted,  
forever grounded  
in this spinning globe,  
to dance beneath a branch!

- Richard Huelsenbeck
