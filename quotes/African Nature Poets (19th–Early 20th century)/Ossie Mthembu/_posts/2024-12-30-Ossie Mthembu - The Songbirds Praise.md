The Songbird's Praise

With dawn’s gentle caress,
The songbird takes to the sky,
Melodies of joy and hope,
Lift the spirit high.

Perched atop a willow,
Breathing life into the morn,
Each note paints the air,
As a new day is born.

Oh, listen to the magic,
In the songbird's sweet refrain,
For nature's choir sings,
In joy and in pain.

- Ossie Mthembu
