There is a peace in the stillness,
in the silence of pine woods,
a sanctuary found in shadows,
a gentle balm for the soul.

Each breath taken with the trees
and again we feel the ground,
a connection made deep and true,
the body calmed, the heart full.

As the sun drifts lower,
a golden hue falls and we are wrapped
in the embrace of everything,
a reminder of what it means to be alive.

- Sara Teasdale
