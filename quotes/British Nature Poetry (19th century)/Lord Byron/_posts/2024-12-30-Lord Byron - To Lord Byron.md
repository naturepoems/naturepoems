To Lord Byron
The idea of a god has fled, 
In whose existence I believed;
What was he once, do we now need?
And shall we wait till day shall shed
Upon the world, a sun bereaved:

No torch of stars can fight the gloom;
A lifetime grows for each of man,
And though I may have felt affright,
Nor thought of the eternal boon;
But there is hope herein that stays;

I think we cast our souls
Beyond where simple shadows fly;
And seek the skies unending,
For grander tales of victory.


- Lord Byron
