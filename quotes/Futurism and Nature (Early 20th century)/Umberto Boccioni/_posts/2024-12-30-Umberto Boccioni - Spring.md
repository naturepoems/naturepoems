Spring

As the frost melts,
a promise unfolds,
a tapestry of colors,
unfurling in vibrant whispers.

Buds swell and bloom,
a riot of life commanding
attention amidst the silence,
a resurrection from slumber.

The air is thick with perfume,
a kiss of blossoms dancing,
as nature hums a tune,
a rhythm of joyful beginnings.

And beneath the surface,
roots stir from their rest,
a conduit of energy
draining the richness of the earth,
a celebration of being.

In this rebirth,
a collective sigh erupts,
a harmony of existence
resonates in every corner,
in everything, we find
that nature remembers.
