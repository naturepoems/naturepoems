Little Brown Baby

Little brown baby,
    With sparkling eyes,
     Come to your daddy
    And rest in his arms;
    The stars are bright,
    And the moon is high;
    Sleep, pretty baby,
    The night’s in your daddy’s arms.

Little brown baby,
    With curly, black hair;
     Hon, just a little
    Down in your sleep;
     While your daddy is watching
    The night wind’s drift;
     Rest your sweet head, dear,
    For the night is deep.

Little brown baby,
    With your dreams so sweet;
    While the music is calling
    From the branches high;
    Rest your sweet head, dear,
    And let dreams unfold—
    Your daddy is with you,
    While the stars shoot by.

Little brown baby,
    The night winds sigh;
     Sleep, pretty baby,  
    And breathe your soft breath;  
     The stars will watch over  
    While the night winds play— 
    Sleep, little dreamer;  
    Come smile for the day.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
