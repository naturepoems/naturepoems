The flowers whisper on the dark,
As shadows slowly leave their mark,
The nightingale in chorus calls,
And through the air, still silence falls.
To stand beneath the reaching pine,
Where branches sway in secret line,
I find my heart entwined in dreams,
Where nature flows in gentle streams.

The dew-kissed petals gleam with life,
While moonbeams cut through nature's strife,
Each moment echoes sweet and shy,
In tranquil realms where sorrow flies.
So hold me close, O sweet refrain,
Your touch, a balm that breaks the pain,
For as I roam your verdant shore,
I breathe in love forevermore.

- Dora Carrington
