Amidst the mountains' lofty reign,
   Where silence speaks in whispered tones,
   Each stone an echo, every grain,
   Breathes tales of time and hidden bones.

   In valleys deep, where shadows play,
   The winds weave songs of distant dreams,
   And every hour marks the day,
   With colors bursting at the seams.

   I find my soul among the trees,
   To hear the secrets, lost yet known,
   For nature holds my heart in ease,
   In every whisper, I am home.

- T E Lawrence
