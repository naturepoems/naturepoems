To a Butterfly

  I love to see thee flit,
So constant in thy flight;
And ‘tis this happy wanderer
  That lifts my heart of light.

For every flower is thine,
  The sun exalting through;
And all the blooms of meadow lead
  To beauty, trust to you.

Now where the forest stands,
  Among the verdant lliss,
Not a single shape of charmed leaves
  But sings thee forth, young bliss.

O to the shade, O lovely, sweet!
  Oh! joy of summer’s grove,
Ah well! the butterfly a spirit,
  Bestow thy love above!

- Robert Southey
