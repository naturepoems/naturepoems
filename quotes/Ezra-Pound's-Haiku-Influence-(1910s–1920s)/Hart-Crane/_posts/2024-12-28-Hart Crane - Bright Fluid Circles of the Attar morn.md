author: Hart Crane
quote: "Bright Fluid Circles of the Attar morn— 
Flecked with fire's pure dance on starlit luster,
Serene as sunrise played on velvet Horn,  
Invisible Connections on nature's fluster—  
Instead of hanging sorrow near the dead—"

Bright Fluid Circles of the Attar morn— 
Flecked with fire's pure dance on starlit luster,
Serene as sunrise played on velvet Horn,  
Invisible Connections on nature's fluster—  
Instead of hanging sorrow near the dead—
