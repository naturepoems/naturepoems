The Whispering Pines

The whispering pines in twilight sway,
  Their secrets softly shared;
With every rustle, night and day,
  A touch of grace declared.

The branches arch, a timeless dance,
  That beckons hearts to know;
In nature’s pulse, we catch a glance
  Of wonder in the flow.

The moonlight drips like silver tears,
  Upon the forest floor;
As shadows weave through night’s warm spheres,
  A tapestry of lore.

In every rustling breeze, I hear
  The echo of the past;
A story told in night’s own sphere,
  As nature’s heart beats fast.

So let the pines surround my soul,
  In whispers soft and true;
For here, I feel the gentle whole,
  In everything I do.
