To the Daffodils

A merry heart goes all the day,
Your joys and woes are but a play.
Come out, my friends, in bloom so bright,
Dance in the sun, till the fall of night.

Laugh to the wind, and hark to the trees;
Let the world be blessed with your golden keys.
You herald spring with your trumpets clear,
What promises, love! how sweet to hear!

In the day’s delight where shadows retreat,
You scatter light, and the air is sweet.
A merry heart—oh, that’s the way!
With daffodils bright, the world we sway.
