The Grasmere Journal

Upon a vale so soft and still,
Where the azure skies like dreams fulfill,
I sit and note the flowers at play,
Their open eyes in bright array.

Invisible threads weave in the air,
Each summer's bounty is layered with care,
The scents arise through wooded climb,
Where stories unfold, in shaping time.

The mountains around watch over me,
Their silent strength, a majesty,
In this cradle of life, I witness grace,
As nature’s hands my spirit embrace.

So here I pen my thoughts in ink,
Beside the brook’s flowing interlink,
Each drop refreshing, each shade divine,
Along this path where the pulse aligns.

- Dorothy Wordsworth
