The Awakening
Awake, O slumbering earth!
Feels the pulse of heaven’s mirth,
As blooms unfurl with joyous glee,
Nature claims her right to be.

The cacophony of colors bright,
The chatter of dawn, the retreat of night,
With every petal, a lover’s sigh,
As the world awakes—time passes by.

What miracles spring pledges high?
In that bright canopy, the larks will fly,
To celebrate the cycle, the endless dance,
In the heart’s revival, the stars advance.

- Wole Soyinka
