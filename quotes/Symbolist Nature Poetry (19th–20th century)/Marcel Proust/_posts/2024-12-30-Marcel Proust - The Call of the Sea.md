What shall we say of the sea, its vast, open heart,  
Where waves kiss the shore and from the depths depart?  
It sings of the ages, of secrets long passed,  
A rhythmic lullaby, a shipwrecked dream cast.  

In the foamy embrace, the salty breeze calls,  
Each sunbeam a promise, where tranquil night falls.  
With each rising tide, we lose and we find,  
The echo of silence, the dance of the mind.  

The horizon stretches, an infinite hue,  
A canvas of wonder, a vision so true;  
In this symphony of blue, my soul draws near,  
Connected to the universe, I hold dear.

- Marcel Proust
