A Forsaken Garden
In the garden where the wild thyme blows
And the primrose twineth her pale gold,
And through the ivy the rose tree knows
The place it grew, as sweet as it’s told,
A deep silence rings through the avenues wide,
The long grass bows with a sighing pride.

For summer’s gone down to the sea’s green bed,
Where the water lulled them and time forgot,
Yet still where the paths of wandering tread,
The whispering leaves their secrets begot,
And sick with the scent of death’s approach,
The wild thyme fades in the evening broach.
