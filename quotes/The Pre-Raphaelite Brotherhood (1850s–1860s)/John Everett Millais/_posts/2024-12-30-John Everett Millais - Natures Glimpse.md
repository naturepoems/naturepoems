Nature's Glimpse

In Nature’s embrace, when the day is done,
With whispers of twilight and shadows that run;
It beckons to marvel at wonders so dear,
Where time flows like rivers, and laughter rings clear.

The trees stand in stillness, with leaves intertwining,
As dusk settles softly, their branches aligning.
Each blossom, a memory of seasons gone past,
Holds stories within that forever shall last.

The stars peer above through the lingering mist,
Their twinkle a promise, a lover’s long kiss;
For every nightfall offers hopes to unwind,
A symphony sweet for the dreaming mind.

In Nature’s own bosom, my spirit finds rest,
Cradled in shadows, so peaceful, so blessed;
With sighs of the crickets that rise with the moon,
I linger with Nature, as night sings its tune.
