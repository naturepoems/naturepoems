The Mountain

In splendid heights, where silence reigns,
   The mountain stands, a sentinel in time,
With every echo of the falling rains,
   The heart of nature sings, sublime.

Its peaks adorn the sky's embrace,
   A crown of white upon its brow,
In shadows deep, and every trace,
   A sacred promise held—now, here, and now.

The journey upward tests the soul,
   Each step a prayer, a yearning gaze,
In the mountain's arms, we find our whole,
   A refuge, in the wild, I’m not afraid.

- AJM Smith
