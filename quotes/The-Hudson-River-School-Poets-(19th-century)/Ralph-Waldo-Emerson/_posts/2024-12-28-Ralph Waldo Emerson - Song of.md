Song of Nature

Here is a dream so free and wild,
That runs within the whispering air,
And dances with the joy of a child,
In the forest and the secret lair.

The beauty flows, the rhythm swells,
In gentleness, the heart does heed,
Each note a story's beauty tells,
Each flower, a living seed.

Do walk among the golden dew,
And lift your eyes to sky's embrace;
Believe in all that nature is true,
And leave behind a trace of grace.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
