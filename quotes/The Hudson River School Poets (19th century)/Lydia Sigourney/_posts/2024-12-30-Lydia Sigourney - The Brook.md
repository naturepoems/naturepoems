The Brook

There’s a brook that sparkles bright,  
Under the sunlight’s warm embrace,  
Dancing pebbles, pure delight,  
In its silver, glistening grace.

Whispers sweet the waters tell,  
As they rush along their way,  
In its music, hearts compel,  
To linger on, and dance, and play.

I’ll follow thee through sun and shade,  
Sweet brook, where flowe’r blooms and sigh,  
With every ripple, joy conveyed,  
In nature's arms, I feel so high.

- Lydia Sigourney
