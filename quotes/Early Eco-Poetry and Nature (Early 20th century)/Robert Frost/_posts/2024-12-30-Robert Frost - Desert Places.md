Desert Places
Snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast  
In a lone winter evening,  
I am glad I have had the experience of being removed—  
Shall I ever return?  
There I am from the house now,  
And the spot above to give me, little do I lack.  

To rid myself of what desire had seized,  
Can only ease their wish, wisdom awake;  
As it could draw a full loneliness deep,  
Sound in the hush, like thunder from a rising sky—  
Awake, to say hardly anyone to be found  
In my treks through and beneath the world;  

The sorrow gathers thick;  
Everything in life is cast to shadows.  
Ridges find the solid boundary where I lay back  
As this was not the way to find my grief,  
Nor could the night have settled harder still.  
But rest means growth; the ice beneath my bare  
Thin shoes turned glory as above  
Roams fresh but finds horizons minimum instead;  
Even this turns still, nothing will tire away,  
Beneath the ground where I seem forever now.  

It is the clear and stopping occasioning sound,  
As I see it catching forth the still snow-white,  
Far can cover me, and I will leave my life,  
I could not have thought this blinding but to see  
What bound exists for lonely heart and night.  
It all is light again or even brighter again,  
A simple way of lifting skies in spaces where  
The floor was grave each time passed on inside.
