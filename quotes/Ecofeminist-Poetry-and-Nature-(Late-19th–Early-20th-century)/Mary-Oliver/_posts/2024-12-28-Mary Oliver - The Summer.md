The Summer Day

Who made the world? Who made the swan, and the black bear?
Who made the grasshopper?

This grasshopper, I mean—the one who has flung herself
out of the grass, the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,

who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.
Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.

Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.
I don’t know exactly what a prayer is.

I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down
into the grass, how to kneel in the grass,

how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,
how to embrace the grasshopper, how to love the world.

And yet I am too aware of what I am doing here.
I just want to make a prayer of my own.

I ask of my heart—
how can I make a prayer out of this?

And I ask the grasshopper, who then flies away.

I want to believe that I belong to this world.
