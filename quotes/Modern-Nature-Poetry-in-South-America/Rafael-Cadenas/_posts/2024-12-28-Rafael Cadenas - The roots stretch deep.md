The roots stretch deep 
  into the past,
 cradling whispers 
of an earth 
  that holds 
  the traces of our journey.

Here, in the stillness,
  I find solace,
 layered in the cycles of seasons,
 where life, 
 like the tide, 
 ebbs and flows,

reminding me of all
  I have witnessed.


- Rafael Cadenas
