The Two Voices

There are two voices in the air,
The cloud that drifts like thought,
And rippling streams, on flowery paths,
The wondrous love that’s wrought.

Both lead to Nature’s diadems,
Bright blooms of joy and peace,
While melodies in light descend,
And every power finds release.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
