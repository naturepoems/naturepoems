The Rain

The rain, as it falls,
  is a season of its own.
And your voice
  is a touch of it.
I might as well expect
  to hear you from the shadows
  of the trees that bend in rhythm.
The rain is silent
  and never stays,
  just texture that you sense
  without ever knowing.
So I switch from the need to listen
  to the need to touch—
the feeling, then,
  of reaching out to return.


- Robert Creeley
