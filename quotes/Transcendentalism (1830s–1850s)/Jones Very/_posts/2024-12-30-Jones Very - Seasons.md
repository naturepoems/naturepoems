How swiftly go the seasons 'round,  
From the present to the past;  
And time himself in rapid sound,  
Makes all their beauty last.

Each flower blooms to wither soon,  
Yet bears a thousand dreams;  
While every night falls bright with moon,  
And woven in the beams.

Oh sweet the grass that comes anew,  
That paints the fields so green;  
While nature sings with each soft dew,  
A song we call serene.

Though birds in flight may seek the sun,  
And scatter in the sky,  
The winds shall ever sing, 'tis one,  
At the end of every sigh.
