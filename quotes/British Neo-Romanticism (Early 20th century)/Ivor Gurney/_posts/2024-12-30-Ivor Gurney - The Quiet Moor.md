The Quiet Moor

                    On moors so vast and quiet deep,
                    The heather bends as shadows creep,
                    I find a peace within the glade,
                    Where thoughts are light, and worries fade.
                    
                    The breeze it whispers soft of yore,
                    In every turn of flowered floor,
                    Amongst the starlit folded night,
                    A magic stirs and sets things right.
                    
                    For here, oh moor, where silence reigns,
                    A tapestry of joy remains,
                    And in your heart, my wander stays,
                    To honour all your soulful ways.

- Ivor Gurney
