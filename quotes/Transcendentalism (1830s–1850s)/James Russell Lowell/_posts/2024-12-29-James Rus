Oh, fleeting days of summer's plight,
When the sun dips low and twilight's near;
The golden hour, a pure delight,
In every joy, I hold my dear.

The wildflowers sway in the field,
As laughter echoes in the sun;
A bounty of nature's soft shield,
In each passing moment, a cherished one.

The river glides like a flowing rhyme,
While the echoes of laughter play along;
In these precious hours, time sublime,
We meld with nature, where we belong.

So let me linger in this grace,
With scents of honey and evening’s glow;
In summer's embrace, my heart’s own place,
A paradise where love can flow.

--- From "Summer's Plight"
