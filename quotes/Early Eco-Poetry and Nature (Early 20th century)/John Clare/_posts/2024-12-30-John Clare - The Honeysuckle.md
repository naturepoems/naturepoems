The Honeysuckle
Where honeysuckle tendrils climb,  
Among the lanes that light the day,  
And every flurry brings the chime  
Of natureâ€™s heart that strolls and sways.
 
Each petal's touch that draws the air  
Is music wrapped in tale and song,  
While hues of love like stories share  
A bond where dreams shall linger long.

- John Clare
