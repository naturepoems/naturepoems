As evening falls, the stars appear,
Trees tower high, a home sincere.
The moonlight dances on the creek,
While nature speaks, the heart can seek.
        
The nightingale serenely sings,
Revealing hopes of hidden things.
With every sound, the world is whole,
Natureâ€™s beauty mends the soul.
        
In tranquil woodlands, peace will flow,
And through the dark, our spirits grow.
Life twists and turns in sleeping sights,
But in the vastness, we find lights.

- Philip Larkin
