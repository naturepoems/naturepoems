The Peace of Wild Things

I go among the trees and sit still. 
All my stirring becomes quiet around me 
Like circles on a paper. 
I cease from trying to remember, 
And all the world comes in sharp focus. 
I feel an awareness of wild life. 

I search among the trees for peace, 
But find only the stillness 
Of heavy boughs hanging low. 
So I put my arms around the trunks, 
And love the feel of peace, 
The quiet green of nature.

There is more than a silence here. 
Its breath is full of deeper meanings, 
Of plants and birds and earth. 
I breathe my thoughts in with the air, 
And the wild things coalesce in my heart, 
Until the peace suffuses all they are.

- Sarah Orne Jewett
