The Wind

A zephyr's breath, a howling gale,
The dance of air, both fierce and light;
Through every whisper, tells a tale,
Of night’s embrace and morning’s height.

The wind, it carries hopes and fears,
Across the vale, through every door;
In nature’s rhythm, through the years,
It stirs the soul forevermore.

- Clara Barton
