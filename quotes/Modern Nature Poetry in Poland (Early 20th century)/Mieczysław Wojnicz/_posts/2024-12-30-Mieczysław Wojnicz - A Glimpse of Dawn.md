A Glimpse of Dawn
A whisper breaks the veil of night,
With hues of pink and gold in flight,
The sun peeks through, the world aglow,
In morning's arms, new hope will grow.

The dew drops shimmer, soft embrace,
Upon the earth's awake, a grace,
With every dawn, a chance to be,
In nature's light, we find the key.

- Mieczysław Wojnicz
