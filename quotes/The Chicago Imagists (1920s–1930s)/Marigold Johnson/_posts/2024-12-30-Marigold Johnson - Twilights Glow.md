Twilight’s Glow

As twilight wraps the day in gold,
The sun dips low, its warmth withdrawn,
In hues of orange, red, and bold,
The earth prepares to greet the dawn.

With gentle hands, the night descends,
A cloak of stars, a soft caress,
In every shadow, magic blends,
And whispers peace, a night’s finesse.

- Marigold Johnson
