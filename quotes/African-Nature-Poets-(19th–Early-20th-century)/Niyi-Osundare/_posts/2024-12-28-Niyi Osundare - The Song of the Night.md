The Song of the Night Sky

Look up, the stars are calling,
Their whispers a silver melody,
An unbroken chain of dreams
Stirring in the quilt of quiet night.
They twinkle like winking spirits,
Fetching memories of ancient tales,
Guiding wandering souls home
Through the portal of darkness.

O night sky, vast expanse,
A bar of infinite thoughts,
Draped in shadows, shrouded in beauty,
You embrace the moon’s pale glow,
And cradle the breeze’s soft caress.
In your embrace, I find solace,
A refuge from the day’s clamor.

I listen to the songs of the stars,
To the hum of the universe,
To the prayers in the silence,
All power radiating, gathering
In the dark womb of the cosmos.
For in your vastness, I am whole,
A mere spark, yet endlessly connected
To the infinite tapestry of life.
