The River

The river winds like a serpent,
   It slips through the silver reeds;
It carries the dreams of the saddened,
   It whispers the love that it breeds.

The waters sing to the heavens,
   The mists weave softly like lace;
In the depths of her heart, the river
   Holds secrets of time and of space.

- Marjorie Pickthall
