Shadows flickering in the glade,  
Embrace the wanderers of the light.  
Even when the daylight fades,  
There is beauty in the night.

In every rustle of the hay,  
In every sound the creatures make,  
There's praise for those who find their way,  
In darkened woods by firelight's wake.

As trees stand guard with ancient grace,  
And stars bear witness to our plight,  
Nature designs a warm embrace,  
Beneath the vast and boundless night.


- Philip Larkin
