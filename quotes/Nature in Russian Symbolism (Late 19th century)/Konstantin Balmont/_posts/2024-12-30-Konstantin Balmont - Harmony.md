Beneath the sky of azure blue,
  The rivers weave their silver lace,
  The mountains rise in tranquil splendor,
  Guarding secrets of this place.
  
  Each flower blooms, a work of magic,
  Each breeze, a gentle serenade,
  In the garden of this universe,
  My heart and soul find peace conveyed.

- Konstantin Balmont
