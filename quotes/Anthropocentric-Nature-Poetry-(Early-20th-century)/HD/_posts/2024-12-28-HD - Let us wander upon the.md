Let us wander upon the brooks,
where water shines like glass,
and pebbles kiss the skin.

I seek the place where ferns
unfurl like secrets,
in a sacred act of trust.

Here, insects hum their praises,
and the air is a tapestry
woven with the scent of pine.

To breathe this natural rhythm
is to know the essence of being,
at one with the worldâ€™s heart.
