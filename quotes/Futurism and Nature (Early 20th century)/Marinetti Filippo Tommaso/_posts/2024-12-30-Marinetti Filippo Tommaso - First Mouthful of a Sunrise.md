First Mouthful of a Sunrise
Awake! Awake, oh fire!  
clenched in the eddies of dust!  
While the dawn amasses,  
you draw from reality  
as you crack open the light.

Great radiances  
spilling upon our shade,  
reminding me your name,  
you who speaks to bird wings!  

My eyes drink sunlightâ€™s nectar  
that coats this vast grass,  
letting light spill out of  
treated hearts of exhilaration.

The scent of the flower  
is the pulse of a world  
at play,  
as I taste  
your exhilaration!

Oh dawn,  
you are a feast of beginnings!

- Marinetti Filippo Tommaso
