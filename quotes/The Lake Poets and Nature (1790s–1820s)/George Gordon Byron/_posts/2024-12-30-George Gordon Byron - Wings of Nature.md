A bird upon the wing does soar,
Its song resounds upon the air,
In every note, a mind can explore,
As life dances here without a care.

The trees that stretch to touch the sun,
Stand tall against the azure sky;
Their whispers tell of battles won,
In silence, they loom, and none deny.

So let me wander through these woods,
And feel the beauty wrap around;
For in this space, my heart intrudes,
And in its grasp, forever found!

- George Gordon Byron
