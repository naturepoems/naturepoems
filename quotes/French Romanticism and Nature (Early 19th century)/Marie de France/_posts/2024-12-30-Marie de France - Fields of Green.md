In fields of green, the wildflowers sway,
As breezes sing a soft refrain.
The golden sun marks the day,
While birds celebrate in joyful gain.

Each blossom tells a tale of old,
Of seasons passed and ages long,
With petals kissed by sun and cold,
In natureâ€™s symphony, we belong.

- Marie de France
