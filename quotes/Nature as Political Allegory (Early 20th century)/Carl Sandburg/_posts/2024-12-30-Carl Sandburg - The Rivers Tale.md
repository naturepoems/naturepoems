A river runs through,
Not just a line of water,
But a flow of histories,
A stream of hearts.

Every bank speaks,
Every stone,
A language of the ages;
Where dreams once gathered
To the rhythms of the day.

What lands unfold,
What pains hidden,
In the depths,
The love holds fast
to the drift,
Woven and knife-cut
Into the soft flesh of the world.


- Carl Sandburg
