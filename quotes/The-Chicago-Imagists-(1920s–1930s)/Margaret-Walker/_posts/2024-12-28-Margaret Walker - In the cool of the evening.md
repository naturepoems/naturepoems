In the cool of the evening breeze,
The whispering leaves sing soft and low,
A lullaby for the waiting night,
As shadows dance, and the stars begin to glow.

The moon, a gentle guardian's gaze,
Over fields of silver light,
Cradles the world in dreams,
As day surrenders to the night.

- Margaret Walker
