Summer's Bliss
 
Beneath the boughs of ancient trees,  
Where sunlight filters through the leaves,  
A summer’s day, a gentle breeze,  
Invites the heart to rest and breathe.  

The flowers sway in joyous dance,  
A symphony of colors bright,  
In nature’s warmth, we take our chance,  
To relish in the pure delight.

- Edward Burne-Jones
