In fiery autumn's embrace, leaves swirl and glide,
A kaleidoscope of colors, where memories reside;
Each hue tells a story, each rustle a sigh,
As branches bow gently beneath the bright sky.

Here nature dons her gown of amber and rust,
In the cycle of change, we find hope we can trust.
With each falling leaf, a promise is sown,
In the dance of the seasons, our spirits have grown.

- David Jones
