We are Australian

We're the sons of the gloried land,
The time less kin of the dawn and the shade,
And we share our earthen glass in hand,
With the talents created, our spirits laid.

On the heights in dewy morn we rise,
When the mist flows o'er the bough,
And the mountain sun to meet us flies,
With a tune free and kind, as a guide somehow.

Through the tangled vines, and rocks of gold,
We roam in the virtues with joy,
Our kindled pride we shall hold,
In this wild land, we thrive, do we toy.

For the rivers gleam'd with sparkling light,
And the dreams that are sung, at the cool streams,
And we wake this land with morning bright,
And carefully hold life’s dearest dreams!

So let’s share from the trials hard wrought,
With gentle grace, and to thee, we vow,
Through each fear and love that we're fought,
Forever shall we claim the seed, here and now.

- Banjo Paterson
