quote: "A mountain stands alone,  
a sentinel to the skies,  
its face carved in time  
by winds that have spoken  
here beneath the gaze of eagles,  
a story of silence,  
a gathering of clouds."

A mountain stands alone,  
a sentinel to the skies,  
its face carved in time  
by winds that have spoken  
here beneath the gaze of eagles,  
a story of silence,  
a gathering of clouds.
