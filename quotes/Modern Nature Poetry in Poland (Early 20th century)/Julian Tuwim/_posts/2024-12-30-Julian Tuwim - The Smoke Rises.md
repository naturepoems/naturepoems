The smoke rises, swaying,
Reaching out to the sky,
A dance of a thousand stories
Written by troubled minds,
The wind carries away
The sigh of forest trees,
While the river shimmers,
Reflecting the sunâ€™s tears.

Alone with nature,
Where the heart finds its pulse,
Each leaf a whisper, a secret,
A breath in the time of silence,
And the branches arch like arms,
In embrace with the clouds above.

- Julian Tuwim
