Beyond the Pines

Through the canopy of trees,
where the light dapples,
it spills like a child’s laughter,
a soft glimmer of hope at dawn,
echoing every thought,
woven through the needles,
dragging whispers to the ground.

Set me down amid this expanse,
where air holds the songs of the wild,
a heartbeat intertwined,
a pulse that allows,
a moment to stop,
a marvel in the richness of life.

And in that softness, I feel
the warmth of hands unseen,
eager to embrace,
a refuge cradled in green,
a heart beating with everything,
a space where being can breathe,
a dance unwritten by time’s hand.

- AR Ammons
