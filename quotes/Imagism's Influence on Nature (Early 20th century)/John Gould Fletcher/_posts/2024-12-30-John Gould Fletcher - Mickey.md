Mickey
Mickey lives in a world of flowers,

Each petal a soft satin edge

That holds a dew drop like a tear,

A jewel caughtâ€”a precious hedge.

Mickey dances over the blooms

With laughter that twines in fern and leaf,

Turning the day into a perfect song,

A pure, joyous belief.

The sun lights gently upon his curls,

His spirit flows like a silver brook,

He weaves the flowers into his heart,

In every nook, every hook.

O sweet ephemeral Mickey,

May your laughter never cease,

In the world of flowers, you shall stay

And gently whisper peace.

- John Gould Fletcher
