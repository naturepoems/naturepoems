In the quiet hush of dawn’s first light,  
The world awakens from its sleep,  
Petals unfold, a glorious sight,  
Nature’s wonders, great and deep.

Birdsong rises, a melodic cheer,  
As shadows stretch and daylight grows,  
In the vibrant bloom, life draws near,  
In hues and rhythms that nature knows.


- Yves Tanguy
