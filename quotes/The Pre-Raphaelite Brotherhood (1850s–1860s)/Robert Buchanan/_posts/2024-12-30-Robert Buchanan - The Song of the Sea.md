The Song of the Sea

I.
  Into the deep sea flows the tide,
  In ceaseless whisper,  sweet and wide;
  The solemn waves of doom and grace
  Toss on the night with solemn face.

II.
  It calls to those who seek the land,
  The soul—the thought—a spectral hand;
  For peace is in the silent tears,
  The gentle wisdom of the years.

III.
  So walk with me, O gentle night,
  Letched by the lost stars’ silver light,
  Till dawn shall come with her soft breath,
  And sing to us the song of death.

- Robert Buchanan
