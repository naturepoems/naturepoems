Descriptive Sketches,
   by Charlotte Smith

Lonely on the darken'd sea,  
The anguished winds in tune with me;  
Through each gust that struck the shore,  
Another pain I did implore,  
Yet gave back peace in countenance,  
To see the skies resume romance.  
Books may be lovely, but they can't replace,  
The sweat and blood of nature's grace.

- Charlotte Smith
