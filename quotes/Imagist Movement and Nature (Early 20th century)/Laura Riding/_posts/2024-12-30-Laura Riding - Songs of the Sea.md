With the salt and sea, I lay tenderly,
On a rock held firm with the sun,
Memories of light break across whispers; 
As the tide swells here, recalls each echo,
The laughter that danced through many a song,
Birds that spiral with wings boundless and stronger.
Just there where the ocean warms,
Rhythms caress upon my skin; 
The pure embrace will linger,
Even when beauty dims to fading blue, 
Remembering in gentleness the paths of flowers—
I give unto the waves this time—
To return and carry the sweet unknown.
