The Invitation

Come, thou thou art bright above the skies,
First to survive—the rays of spring where they stir;
To take delight in an hour, and greet with a smile, 
And life should gleam with ceaseless play,
A trembling glimpse of heaven 
Where the radiant footprints gleam.  

— Percy Bysshe Shelley
