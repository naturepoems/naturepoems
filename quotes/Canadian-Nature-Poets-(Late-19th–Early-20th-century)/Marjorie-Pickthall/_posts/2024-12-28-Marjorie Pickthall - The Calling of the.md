The Calling of the Sun

I hear the call of the sun,
   It comes with a joyous sound;
It rouses the flowers from sleep,
   It wakes the world all around.

The meadows are bathed in glory,
   The streams flash bright in the day,
The sun whispers sweetly to me
   To come out and play.

- Marjorie Pickthall
