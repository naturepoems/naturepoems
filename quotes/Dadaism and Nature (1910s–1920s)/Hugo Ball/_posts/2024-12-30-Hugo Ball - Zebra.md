Zebra
Sleek as a bar of soap
Wet sky above
The zebra leans towards the fountain
His nose is on fire
Cancerous clouds erupting
Dandelions all around
They laugh with white teeth
Squeezing and swooping beside us.

And we...
We hum a tune
Walking in tax fill
Dreaming of another planet
With zebras and fawns
Dancing under the green moon.

- Hugo Ball
