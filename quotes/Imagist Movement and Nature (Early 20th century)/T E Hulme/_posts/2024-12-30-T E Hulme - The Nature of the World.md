The Nature of the World

Drops of water  
Fray a thread of silk,
Laughter brings me here,
Like a white cloud,
Dawning on the light,
Wet, like the earth.

But I feel the stones,
Under a light shower,
Like the treads of feet,
Beneath a tread of water,
Where life expands,  
And mass and weight  
Of the joyous air.

In pleasure, blisters are clear,
Like the glass that holds;
And during fresh hours,  
With soft shadows,
That mock the dilating spring,
I feel that nature is,
A quivering truth,  
Without body or design.

- T E Hulme
