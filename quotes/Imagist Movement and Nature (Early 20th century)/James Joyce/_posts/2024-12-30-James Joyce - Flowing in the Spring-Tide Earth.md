Flowing in the spring-tide earth,
The motion of the lake,
A lapping sound, the breath of mirth,
A wave and flower make.

As splashed about the dancing light,
With children hopping near,
They swirl in dreams of nature bright,
From depth to crystal clear.

The evening holds an aura close,
A hush of shadows still,
While lilacs bloom in soft repose,
With night to weave the thrill.

O full of life the evening glows,
A quiet hush descended,
And memories of a world that knows,
Shall keep the heart befriended.


- James Joyce
