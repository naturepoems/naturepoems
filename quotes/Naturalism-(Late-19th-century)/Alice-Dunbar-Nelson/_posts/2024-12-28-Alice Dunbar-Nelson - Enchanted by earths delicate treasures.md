Enchanted by earth's delicate treasures that glow,  

In the warm light of spring, as the world takes its breath,  

From crocus to daffodil, colors overflow,  

Celebrating life in the dance of sweet death.


For each petal that falls, a memory to feel,  

Bringing forth the promise of moments unspoken,  

In the cadence of time, natureâ€™s heart shall reveal,  

That life, in its beauty, is never broken.

- Alice Dunbar-Nelson
