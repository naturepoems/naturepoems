Chasing Shadows
On the meadow where shadows freely play,
Natureâ€™s fleeting forms dance in the fray.
Chasing the edges where light softly slips,
In the laughter of grasses, the heart gently dips.

The sun casts its spell, a golden embrace,
Each fleeting moment, a soft, tender grace.
In the blend of the twilight, life seems to gleam,
Caught in the magic, forever we dream.

- Alexei Kruchyonykh
