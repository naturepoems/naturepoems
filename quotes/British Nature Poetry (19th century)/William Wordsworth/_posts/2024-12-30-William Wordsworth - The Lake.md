By the side of the Lake,
In the shadowy glade,
Daisies bloom,
Their night close fading among the ferns,
Through the shadowy brush alone,
Yet one bright spot remains eternally bright.

The murmurs of the night,
Resound softly round with voices,
Renouncing natureâ€™s tune of cheer,
While every song is heard in grace,
As twilight caresses the perfect space.


- William Wordsworth
