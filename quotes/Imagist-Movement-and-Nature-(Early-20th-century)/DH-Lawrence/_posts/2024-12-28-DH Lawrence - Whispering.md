Whispering Trees
  
Oh to wander in your presence,
Whispering trees,
That cradle the secrets
Of the gentle winds,
Holding hands with clouds
In the timeless sky.

Let me become attuned
To your murmuring life,
O green giants,
As the shadows stretch,
To shade my heart
With warmth and shelter.

For every sigh and rustle,
For every glance of light,
Is but a soft encouragement
To open, to grow,
And to breathe in this bond
With nature divine.

                         - DH Lawrence
