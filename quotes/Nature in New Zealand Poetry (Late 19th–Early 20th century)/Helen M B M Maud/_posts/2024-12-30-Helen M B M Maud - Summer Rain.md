Summer Rain

In summer’s haze, the air is warm,
Then drops descend like whispered sighs;
A gentle touch, a soothing balm,
As nature’s tears fall from the skies.

The earth drinks deep from heaven’s cup,
Each droplet sings of life anew;
The flowers lift their heads, they sup,
As colors bloom in glittered hue.

Come dance with me in summer rain,
Let laughter mingle with the drops;
In wild abandon, love’s refrain,
For in the storm, our heartbeats stops.

- Helen M B M Maud
