A light exists in Spring  
Not present on the Year  
At any other period—  
When March is scarcely here—  

A color stands abroad  
On Solitary Fields—  
That Science cannot overtake  
But Human Nature feels—  

It waits upon the Lawn—  
It shows the furthest Tree  
Upon the furthest slope you know—  
The Castle in the Air—  

And he alone can view it  
And feel this feathery sound  
And hear the trembling notes of Night—  
That are not tones of ground.  


- Emily Dickinson
