Snow

Winter rains are here,
Beneath the soft lace of shrouded earth,
A slow whisper falls.
Sculpting shapes across the field
   Of bright-as-snow silent stars,
Rest there upon your luminous crystals.

Dare we seek the beauty,
That feigned in earthen shadow buds,
A weather of light returns through dark,
Sprung forth as summer’s flickering fig?

— H.D. (Hilda Doolittle)
