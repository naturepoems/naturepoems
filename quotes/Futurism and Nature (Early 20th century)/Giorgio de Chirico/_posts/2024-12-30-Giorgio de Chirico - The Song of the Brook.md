The rushing brook sings a vibrant tune,
Each note is cool as winterâ€™s breathe,
Flowing through the cracks of ancient stone,
It carries tales from the mountains high.

A solitary figure leans down low,
To glimpse the mirage of stars above,
Reflections fleeting, like forgotten hopes,
Eke out chords in harmony with nature's song.

And as twilight brushes the canvas clear,
Life reminds us of shadows and light,
Each drop of water, a story of ages,
Resilient ripples challenging our perception.

- Giorgio de Chirico
