Ode to the Forest
O Nature!  thou art glorious,
In thy green and leafy pride,
In thy bosom I would hide,
From the rush and roar of our cities,
from the turmoil of human views;

May I dwell in thy depths, unseen,  
Where the golden sunshine glories,  
Threading through thy leaves,  
Dancing with the soft, unwhispering breeze.

Oh to walk thy verdant aisles,
Where the rippling brooklet weaves
‘Twixt emerald-lined paths,
And the wild flowers smile down at my feet.

Here’s a joy amidst the sorrow—
My spirit finds its rest,  
For I am one with thee,  
In the calmness of God’s design.  

Here, nature’s great heart beats freely,
Here, I see the world made bright,  
As the sweet scents of blossoms fill the air,
And the glorious sun sets a’fire the night.


- J C R Selwyn
