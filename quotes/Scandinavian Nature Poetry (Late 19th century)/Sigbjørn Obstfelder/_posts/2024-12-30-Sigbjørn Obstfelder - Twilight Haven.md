A lonely cabin by the lake, so still,
Reflects the mountains, their majesty bold;
As evening descends, the sky blazes bright,
With hues of orange, violet, and gold.

The waters shimmer, a mirror of dreams,
And the world around pulses with twilight’s grace;
Here in this haven, my heart finds its rest,
In nature's vast beauty, I find my place.

- Sigbjørn Obstfelder
