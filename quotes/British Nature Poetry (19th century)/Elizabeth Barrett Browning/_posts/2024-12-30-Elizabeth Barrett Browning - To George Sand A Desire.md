The sunshine is a lonesome light
That storms in winter days,  
And only love can burn in right
To fill the hearts of those it sways.
Oh, lonesome light, where art thou gone?
The swallows haunt thy ways like dreams,
And here the beating of my heart
Echoes but to the silent streams.
Ah, yes! In sun's warm response to dew,
Life sighs in woods, and sighs for you!

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
