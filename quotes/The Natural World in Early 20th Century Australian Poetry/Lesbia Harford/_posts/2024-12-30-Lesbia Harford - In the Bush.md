In the Bush

Alone, away from the cries of the town,  
Into the shadow of the trees,  
I wandered beneath the green leaves high,  
Where laughter of laughter is rejoined.  
Not a man unhurried passes along,  
Only my dreams are the light of the night.  
There, the flocks in tears greet me;  
And solitude wraps itself away, with only its winged crowd to sing!  
And I deem it old and wrong!

- Lesbia Harford
