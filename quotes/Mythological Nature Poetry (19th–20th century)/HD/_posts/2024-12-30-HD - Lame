Lament for the
fading light,
the dew draws near
and night takes
her breath to hold
this promise—
the echo of flowers,
a flush of beauty
passed in silence. 

How deep and subtle
is the light,
how graceful the curve
of the shadows,
that climb from the earth,
to touch the stars,
those shimmered sources
of night's embrace. 

For though time
goes like water,
these moments weave
into the golden hours.
at the heart betwixt
journeys of earth,
the rose bends its head
to listen, in patience.
