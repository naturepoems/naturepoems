The Quiet Lake
  
  The quiet lake reflects the skies,
  A canvas stretched with nature’s hues;
  In tranquil depths, my spirit flies,
  Upon the waves, my worries lose.
  
  The ripples speak in soft refrain,
  Of time that flows and moments shared;
  In solitude, I find my gain,
  As whispers of the wild ensnared.
  
  The sun dips low, the stars appear,
  With every twinkle, dreams take flight;
  In nature’s heart, I find my cheer,
  The quiet lake, my soul’s delight.
