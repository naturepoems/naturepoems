As spring awakens from its rest,
The blooms of color, nature dressed.
With every petal, life reborn,
In joyous dance, I greet the morn.

The bees begin their tender flight,
In fields of gold, a pure delight.
Here in the sun, my heart shall sing,
In every moment, gratitude I bring.


- Zora Neale Hurston
