Mountains rise in majesty,
Their peaks adorned with purest snow.
With valleys deep, and skies so free,
A world where wild creatures roam below.

The eagle soars on wings of grace,
While shadows dance in sunlight’s gleam.
In nature’s arms, we find our place,
A fleeting, beautiful dream.

- Marie de France
