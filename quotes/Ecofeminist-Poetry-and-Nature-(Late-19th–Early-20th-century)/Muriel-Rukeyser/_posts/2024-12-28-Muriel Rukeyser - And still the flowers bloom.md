And still the flowers bloom,   
in sun, in rain,   
no matter how we struggle,  
these echoes dance upon our minds,   
yet endure past love and plight —   
a new blossom, an indomitable soul.

It finds its way   
one petal at a time,  
a strength borne of light amazes,   
as pure as innocence,   
as fierce as the fires of desire.
