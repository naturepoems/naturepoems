The Sound of Trees

I wonder about the trees.
Why do we wish to bear
The fruits of trees, the paths they weave.
Each bough is shaking near and clear.

I see the trees will go on singing,
The trees will sing for me.
Why need that air I breathe?
Why need those clouds from away?

I can hear the leaves alone,
Their rustling only calls to me.
Through all the leaving paths
I'm bound and free as can be.

- Robert Frost
