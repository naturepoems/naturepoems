ODE TO THE MOON

Golden orb that graces night,  
Crowned in silver, clad in light;  
O moon, you guide the wandering heart,  
And from the dark, my soul’s depart.

With every beam, your beauty gleams,  
A tranquil balm to endless dreams;  
For in the calm, I find my way,  
O gentle moon that rules the day.  


- A E Housman
