Moonlight on the Water

Under a blanket of stars,
the moon finds her way,
glisten to the song of the night,
as it wraps around,
washes over the land,
with its silver embrace,

like spirits released,
carefree, dancing on the waves,
illuminating the paths of dreams,
each ripple
a newly spun tale,
a fleeting moment in time.

The world is a canvas,
a reflection of desire,
a gentle reminder that we are here,
immersed in the soft glow,
a tranquil space,
a sanctuary of peace,

as night whispers softly,
yearning to hold us,
in the moonlight,
where echoes of longing
fuse with the rhythm,
each breath counts as one,
a testament to all we have felt,
alive under its magic.


- Diane di Prima
