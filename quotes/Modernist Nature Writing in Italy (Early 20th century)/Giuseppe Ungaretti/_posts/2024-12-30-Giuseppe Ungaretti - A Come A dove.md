A Come A dove

           When I think of the dove
           That in the dusk
           Flew to the olive tree,
           I think of the pulse
           Of the sky,  
           In the breath of the world.
           It sang, like a flower,  
           That burst into light  
           Completely.  

           


- Giuseppe Ungaretti
