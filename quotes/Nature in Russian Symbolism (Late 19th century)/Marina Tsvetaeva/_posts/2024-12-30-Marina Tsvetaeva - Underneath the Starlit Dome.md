Underneath the starlit dome,
Where cosmic wonders twinkle bright,
I walk upon the whispered path,
Illuminated by the night.
Each step a reverence to the ground,
Where flowers bloom in silent prayer,
And nature wraps her gentle arms,
In the stillness of the evening air.
As the moon reflects on tranquil seas,
In liquid silver, dreams take flight,
I find my heart, my soul, my peace,
In the magic of the night.

- Marina Tsvetaeva
