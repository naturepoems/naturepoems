The Cat Song
  
  I love the cat’s back, how it relieves the tension
 In the room.
 Even in mid winter,
 It comes and stretches on the gray bedspread,
 Flicks its tail and grins.
  
  There are many mornings when I go to the window,  
  But it’s the cat that looks out,  
  Its green eyes scanning the snowdrops,  
  The crooked sticks,  
  The thin branch of the willow.  
  
  "What are you thinking, dear friend?"
  I ask softly,  
  And it lets out its long howl}}]}  замечка  echelon2  98egT76g3425IEWlax AppRoutingModule .code.stage_trading_code.checked OutOfServices  examples.43109946  .  f used motion . . . .05201803 2.
