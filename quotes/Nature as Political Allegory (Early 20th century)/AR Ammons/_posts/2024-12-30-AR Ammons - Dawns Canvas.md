With every dawn, the world transforms,
a spectacle that deconstructs darkness,
nature's canvasâ€”the colors expanding,
a freshness in air ripe with promise.

Though silence hums beneath the surface,
chaos brews in the heart of color,
each bird call, each stir of leaf,
weaves together the fabric of awakening.
