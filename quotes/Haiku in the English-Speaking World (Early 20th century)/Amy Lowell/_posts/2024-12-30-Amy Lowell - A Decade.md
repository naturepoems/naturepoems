A Decade

What a strange country  
This is where I have wandered,  
This country where I have learned to know  
The vivid trees and strange flowers,  
Each one with a name  
I have had to remember that  
Now I would forget.

The nights have been clear  
With a silver moon and I thought  
That everywhere I had traveled,  
I should have been like the trees,  
Colourfully dressed, with scented,  
Bright-haired flowers leaning to me.  
What a strange country  
And what a strange time!

- Amy Lowell
