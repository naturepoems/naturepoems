The Idea of Order at Key West

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind
Of man or of woman.

In solitude, oneâ€™s own image, strange
As viewed through the veil of that poetry,
The sea was not a woman, mindless,

But an image of the body of a woman,
And the singing was that made the body live.
It was the dead that listened  
To what the sea was.

- Wallace Stevens
