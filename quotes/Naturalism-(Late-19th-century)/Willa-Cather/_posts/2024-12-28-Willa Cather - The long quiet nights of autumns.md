The long, quiet nights of autumn’s breath
Bring forth the harvest of fleeting hours,
Within the twilight haze, lies a gentle peace,
Amongst the fields, the milking cows.

The sound of crickets serenades the dusk,
As the stars awaken, shimmering bright,
And in the stillness, I find my trust,
In the beauty of day yielding to night.

What joy it is, to watch the sun dip low,
Painting the hills in hues of sapphire and rose,
As shadows stretch long and the world moves slow,
Nature wraps her arms in a warm repose.

In this quiet hour, where time stands still,
I gather the memories like grains of sand,
For in these moments, I taste the thrill,
Of the wild, of the beauty that life has planned.

- Willa Cather
