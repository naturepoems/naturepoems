The trees
are a little rough, a little dead,
like the old drama of the earth
that knows all things and tells no tales.

I walk in the dark later,
with my mind closed,
remembering their lines
bending, breaking in the wind,
answers in stillness,
waiting for me,
who built my life on their silence.

- Carl Sandburg
