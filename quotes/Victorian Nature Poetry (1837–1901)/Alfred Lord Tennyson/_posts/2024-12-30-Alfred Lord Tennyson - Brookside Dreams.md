By the brook, in wooded glades,  
A myriad whispers shake the leaves,  
Where the light coursing through the glades  
With laughter dances, and deceives.

The flowers twine their fragrant necks,  
And draw us to their busy throng;  
The heart gives way and gladly wrecks  
To join the joyous, wild song.

So soft the flow of time can seem,  
So easy life spins on a wheel;  
In nature's beauty, lost in dream,  
The heart may learn to feel.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
