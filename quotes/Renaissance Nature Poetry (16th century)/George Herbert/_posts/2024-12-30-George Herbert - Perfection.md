Perfection

O hollow sun, whose beams do break the ice,  
And lengthen shadows, and deepen the green.  
O fairest of the fairest things divine,  
How can this shineâ€”that in thee shines,  
Doth rest so still at perfect peace,  
To shine and dazzle all hearts strong;  
What space heaven grants that should be bright,  
For who hath loved not yet been drawn through love?  
Balance our pains against thy perfect grace  
And make no space of sight to bless our place.



- George Herbert
