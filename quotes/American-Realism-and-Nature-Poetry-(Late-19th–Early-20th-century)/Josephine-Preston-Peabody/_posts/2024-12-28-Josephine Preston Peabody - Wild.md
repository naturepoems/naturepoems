Wild Roses

In the wild, a bloom so rare,
Those velvet petals twine in air.
With nature's art, they paint the scene,
Their colors dance, a bright serene.

And in the breeze, they sway and sway,
A fragrant whisper to the day.
Such beauty found in woods and glens,
As Nature's hand her canvas lends.

Each bloom a story, a breath of spring,
A song of joy that wild things sing.
With every stroke upon the earth,
A celebration of joy and birth.
