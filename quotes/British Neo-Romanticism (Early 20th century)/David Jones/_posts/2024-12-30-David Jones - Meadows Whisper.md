In the hush of the meadow, where daisies bloom wide,
The air filled with laughter, the worldâ€™s gentle tide;
Where crickets sing softly and shadows engage,
Nature whispers secrets as we turn the page.

With the sun on my shoulders, I wander and roam,
In the heart of the wild, I have found my true home.
With every bright color, with every sweet sound,
In the tapestry of life, my spirit is found.

- David Jones
