The Snow Man
One must have a mind of winter
To regard the frost and the boughs
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;
And have been cold a long time
To behold the junipers shagged with ice,
The spruces rough in the distant glitter
Of the January sun; and not to think
Of any misery in the sound of the wind,
That is the sound of the land full of the same
Things that are not to be said. 

But, in the snow, the pure of spirit,
The heart in the sense of things,
It is to behold the figures of thought
And the existence of nothing at all 
In the image of the real. 



Anecdote of the Jar
I placed a jar in Tennessee,
And round it went upon a hill.
It made the slovenly wilderness
Surround that hill.

The wilderness rose up to it,
And sprawled around, no longer wild.
The jar was round upon the ground
And tall and of a port in air.

It took dominion everywhere.
The jar was white, with a wildness,
And when I sat it high upon a hill,
It was like the sense of a tree.



Sunday Morning
Death is the mother of beauty; hence from beauty.
This is the philosophy of the instant
In the lost continuance, the awareness
Of the universal in the individual,
The selective lightness of the day.

We live in incantation,
The meditation of the trees,
The influence of the sun and sky.
The thought of what awaited us opens
With each moment full of its color.

The worship of the earth lies in the motion
Of our lives and the stillness
Of man in the always moving morning.



Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird
I
Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.

II
I was of three minds,
Like a tree
In which there are three blackbirds.

III
The blackbird whistled
At the break of day,
And rode back, the snow,
In the same breeze
That brushed the fields on days like this.

IV
I know noble accents
And lucid, inescapable rhythms;
But I know, too,
That the blackbird is involved
In what I know.

V
When the blackbird flew out of sight,
It marked the edge
Of one of many circles.

VI
At dusk, the blackbird
Brought back the same breath
Of air which bordered on the beauty
Of leaves and the evening’s balance.

VII
I could imagine the blackbird
Singing on through the nights and days
That went on like a river.

VIII
The blackbird is within
The thoughts of my day, a limit
That seems to float in color.

IX
In the fall of the early light,
The motions of the blackbird
Help to cross this continual border.

X
Between the beauty and the noise,
I see the modes of the blackbird,
The replies in the voice of his song.

XI
Yet among these, there are the sounds
And forms that separate us,
A touch upon my ear, across the distance
Of many earths and many lines.

XII
I wish to say how the sad call
Of the blackbird floats, mingling,
In serene ways with the sky;
And yet that space stretches and connects,
Fusing the between with the horizon.

XIII
I am the blackbird, hovering, carrying
The world upon my wings —
A thought I wish to be free.



Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction

The poem of the mind in the act of finding
What will suffice. It has not always had
To find: the scene was set; it was given.

The culture with which we thought
Primitive. The act of clinging
To what one had conceived 
Is often the scorn of those who make it live; 
For those who make, it goes beyond the idea.

I wish to think of life as varied,
In thousands ways imagined in the earth’s
Cleverness and recurrence; all that is round
And the essence of this search for truth
That is surrounded by these thoughts.

The act of the imagination in which
One sees what the mind has made
And thinks of what remains unseen,
In the beauty of the real with its colors.



The Emperor of Ice-Cream
Let be be finale of seem.
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.

Call the roller of big cigars,
The muscular one, and bid him whip
In kitchen cups concupiscent curds.

Let be be finale of seem.
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.

Take from the dresser of deal,
Lacking the three glass knobs, that
Shattered, in a thousand ways, beneath

The weight of women in the dark,
And the life that goes on in the rooms.

Let be be finale of seem.
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.

- Wallace Stevens
