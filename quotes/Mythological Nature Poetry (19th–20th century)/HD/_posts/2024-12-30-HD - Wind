The wind
does not know
this valley
is not so lost
as it seems,
for the call
you hear is
the swallows returning,
a bird's song, alive
in among the pines.

From the sea
comes a breath
to tender the leaves,
whispering promises
to the green,
allowing the rosebud
to bloom,
a spilling red
among the golden
and the dark.

Let time go,
yet hold the dances
of the past in
the palm of flower,
a petal's touch,
a tender grasp
that holds the sun,
a memory unlost
a glimmering of green,
a harp among these
silent grounds.
