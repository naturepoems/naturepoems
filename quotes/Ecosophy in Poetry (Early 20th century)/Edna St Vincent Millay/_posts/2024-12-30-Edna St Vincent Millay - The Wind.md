The Wind  
  ---------  
O haggard wind,  
  That blows and blows;  
Across the fields, you mourn  
And pass the sunlight near the trees;  
Lost soul, that hast no tune  
To bear the weight of timeâ€”  
  But the grass shall grow thick;  
For you shall be salt,  
And the moon shall be moon,  
And stars shall take wing  
And reach to our hearts.  


- Edna St Vincent Millay
