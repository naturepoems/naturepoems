Song of the Open Road
Give me the open road,
And the bright new day,
The trees that shake with laughter,
And the wind that sweeps away.

Where the skylarks soar high
  And the sun shines bright,
And the rivers laugh freely
  At the dance of the light.

Let me roam in freedom,
  With nature wild and free,
For the road is ever singing,
  A song just meant for me.

- Langston Hughes
