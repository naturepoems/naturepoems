author: Futurist Poet
quote: "Grass blades gather in morning dew,
Each droplet shines with everyday hue.
The croak of frogs, a symphony rare,
In the ear of the storm, the day's silent prayer.

Concrete roses push through cultural grime,
Offering wisdom outside of time.
In the heart of the city, nature's roar,
A Dadaist vision forever to explore."

Grass blades gather in morning dew,
Each droplet shines with everyday hue.
The croak of frogs, a symphony rare,
In the ear of the storm, the day's silent prayer.

Concrete roses push through cultural grime,
Offering wisdom outside of time.
In the heart of the city, nature's roar,
A Dadaist vision forever to explore.
