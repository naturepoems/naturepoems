As autumn dances on the breeze,  
Leaves rustle their goodbyes,  
Painting the ground in flaming colors,  
A farewell symphony of nature.  
Crimson and gold twirl gracefully,  
Like whispered secrets among trees,  
Preparing the earth for winter's slumber,  
In a tapestry woven with love.

- Nydia Lamarque
