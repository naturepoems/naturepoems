Morning Dew

A thousand diamonds resting on blades of grass,
Each droplet holds the dawn's first light,
As the sun stretches from its slumber,
The world awakens, fresh and bright.

Birdsong breaks the stillness,
A symphony of life renewed,
And the gentle breeze carries stories,
Of the night, of dreams, of dew.

In this sacred hour, I find my place,
Amidst the wonders nature's spun,
With every breath, I feel the grace,
Of morning’s touch, of day begun.

- John Thompson
