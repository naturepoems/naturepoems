To What Serves Mortal Beauty?

To what serves mortal beauty?  
Every dropp and stroke,  
Of freckled brow and lined,  
Beyond the palm of what must break.

How quick life's passage strikes! Alert  
And then this world, dead game!
Its few winds of the unridden,  
From dust are lost, on dregs of flame.

â€” Gerard Manley Hopkins
