Spring Awakening

Awake, oh heart, from your winter sleep,
The tender light of Spring's embrace,
Where dandelions promise to leap,
And the violets join in the chase.

Each bud unfurls with delicate brush,
Coloring the world in gentle hues,
And the songs of birds rise in a rush,
As life awakens in earthy cues.

The dance of breezes croons and sways,
In harmony with natureâ€™s grace,
While every flower, with bold displays,
Renders the earth a vibrant place.


- Mary Webb
