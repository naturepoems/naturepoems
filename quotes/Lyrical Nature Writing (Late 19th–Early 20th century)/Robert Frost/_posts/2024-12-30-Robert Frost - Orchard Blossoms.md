An orchard bright with blossoms fair,
Enfolds a world in sweet delight.
Where daybreak brings a fragrant air,
And laughter dances with the light.

Each moment blooms like fruit divine,
Supplying nectar for the soul;
Where bees and butterflies entwine,
And nature weaves a porcelain whole.

In seasons’ change, I’ll hold this still,
With gratitude that runs so deep.
For life finds beauty, life finds thrill,
In every essence it must keep.

- Robert Frost
