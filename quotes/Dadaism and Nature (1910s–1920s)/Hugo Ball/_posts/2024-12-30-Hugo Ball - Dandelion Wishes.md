Dandelion Wishes
Dandelions in the sun,
Wishes afloat on tender puffs,
Children dance in ecstasy,
As each seed takes flight,
A delicate whimsy in the air,
Cradled by the lightness of being.

Whimsical dreams scatter away,
Against a blue backdrop,
While the elders spun yarns
Of the grasslands and wildflowers,
Amidst petals, we lose time,
Giggles carried by haunted winds.

- Hugo Ball
