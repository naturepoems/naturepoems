The air is alive with the scent of the pine,
As dusk paints the world with a lavender brush.
Creatures are stirring, by day’s end they align—
A chorus of life in a soft evening hush.
Here nature speaks softly, her voice sweet and low,
In harmony's echo, our spirits will rush.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
