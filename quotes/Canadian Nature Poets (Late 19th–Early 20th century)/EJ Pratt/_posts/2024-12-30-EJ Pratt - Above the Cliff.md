Above the Cliff  
  
  
Above the cliff the eagles fly,  
In circles graceful, bold they soar,  
They ride the winds that never sigh,  
And paint the heights in glorious lore.  
  
Beneath the sun, the shadows cast,  
A dance of light and dark entwined,  
Where rocks and vegetation cling  
And time, with silent hand, has twined.  
  
A tapestry of land and sky  
Unfolds in colors rich and rare,  
And in that space where worlds combine,  
I find my heart, my soul laid bare.

- EJ Pratt
