So fair the trees that summer brings,
So great the shadows on the ground;
The sun comes forth with gilded wings,
And wild things make a joyful sound.

With golden glimmer everywhere,
The apple buds do hum the tune,
With merry children over there,
And bats that linger ’neath the moon.

- William Morris
