Whispering Pines
In the hush of dawn’s embrace,
the pines whisper secrets to the breeze,
a symphony of rustling needles
and soft sighs of ancient trees.

Under their watch, the world unfolds,
a tapestry of mist and dew,
where sunlight weaves through verdant boughs,
a cathedral of green, serene and true.

Birdsong flutters in delicate arcs,
while shadows dance on earth’s canvas,
in this tranquil haven, nature sparks
the essence of breath, a moment to ponder.


- Thomas S P S Munch
