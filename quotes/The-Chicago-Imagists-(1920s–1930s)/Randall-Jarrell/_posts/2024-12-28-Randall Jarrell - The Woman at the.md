The Woman at the Well
    There, in a crack between stones,
    The clear water runs,
    Its little voice singing to the grass.
    The old stones listen, rapt. 

    She moves so slowly, as if changing grains,
    When I look up, her head is
    Dropped, like the last night.
    Water falls to the wild earth.

- Randall Jarrell
