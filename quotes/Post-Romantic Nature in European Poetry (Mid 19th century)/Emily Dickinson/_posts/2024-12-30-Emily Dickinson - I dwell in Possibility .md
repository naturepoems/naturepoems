I dwell in Possibility –  
A fairer House than Prose –  
More numerous of Windows –  
Superior – for Doors –  

Of Chambers as the Cedars –  
Impregnable of Eye –  
And for an everlasting Roof  
The Gambrels of the Sky –  

Of Visitors – the fairest –  
For Occupation – This –  
The spreading wide of Dwelling –  
My name – is Possibility –

- Emily Dickinson
