Tides of the Ocean

In the rhythm of the waves,
There lies a world unknown,
Echoes of stories, songs,
Borne across blue heartbeats,
Over sands and stones,
Kissed by the salt of solitude.

The sea's voice calls to me,
In crescendos and decrescendos,
In ripples and rumblings,
A poet's paradox of chaos and calm,
For every tide the ocean breathes
Brings a whisper of the nauplii,
A signal from the depths.

O grandest blue, I reach out
To your vastness, your bounty,
To the myriad creatures
That swirl in your depths;
In your embrace, raw and undone,
I find the stories of humanity,
Both fragmented and whole.

- Niyi Osundare
