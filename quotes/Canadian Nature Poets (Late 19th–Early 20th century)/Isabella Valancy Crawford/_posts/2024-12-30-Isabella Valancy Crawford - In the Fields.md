In the Fields

There’s nothing that sings like your song, O grass!
  Just to hear your soft whispers in the breeze;
When the summer bids the flowers to pass,
  You cloak the fields in velvet, sweet as these.

The hum of bees, the murmur of the stream,
  Fold into me a peace I know is real;
I see the sun on each bright petal beam,
  And feel the soft caress of Nature’s zeal.

- Isabella Valancy Crawford
