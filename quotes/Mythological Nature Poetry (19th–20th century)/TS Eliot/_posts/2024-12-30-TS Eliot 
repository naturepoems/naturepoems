In ancient times where rivers flowed,  
  
In caverns deep where shadows dwell,  
  
The stories of the earth bestowed—  
  
A tale of love, a tale to tell.  
  
And in the bramble, in the light,  
  
The voices sing of loss and gain;  
  
A path entwined in day and night,  
  
That speaks of beauty mixed with pain.

- TS Eliot
