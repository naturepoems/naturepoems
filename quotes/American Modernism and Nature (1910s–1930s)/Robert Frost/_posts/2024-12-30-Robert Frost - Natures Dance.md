Poems about nature will have no end,
For each season sings a brand new tune.
Winter wraps the earth in velvet white,
Spring gives rise to blooms kissed by the moon.

Summer spreads her arms in laughter,
While autumn's colors dance and play,
Every moment spent outside, my friend,
Becomes a page in nature’s grand ballet.

- Robert Frost
