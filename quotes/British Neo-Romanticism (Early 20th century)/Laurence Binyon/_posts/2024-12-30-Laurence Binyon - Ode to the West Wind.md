Ode to the West Wind 

O mad winds, bursting forth again;  
   And wherefore hast thou come  
To lift the sullen clouds from off the vale,  
   And to wake the joyous hum?  
The fires that flickered at the fall of night  
   Burgeon beneath thy reign;  
The rivers sing aloud thy praise,  
   And dance along the plain.  

â€“ Laurence Binyon
