The Fish

Immense, a fish
    appears, to thump
    its tail against the
        bottom of the
        boat. 
Some wonder at the
        delicate frill
            and curl of its
            gills, other%20
        aspects of the
    fish—its body, its
        muscle, its rich,
        oily sheen—
are not lost on me.  
Why not concentrate
        on it?  The whole
    animal seems surely
        to be alive.
