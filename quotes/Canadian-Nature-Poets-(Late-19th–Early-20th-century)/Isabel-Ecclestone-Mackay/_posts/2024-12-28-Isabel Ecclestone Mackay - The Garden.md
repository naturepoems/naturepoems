The Garden Within

In every seed that dares to grow,  
Beauty whispers, “I hold the key!”  
With faith, I’ve learned the art to sow  
A lovely garden deep in me.  

Each flower blooms with strength and grace,  
A testament to all I've weathered;  
In shade or sun, I find my place,  
In earth’s embrace, my soul is tethered.  

And when the winds of fortune blow,  
My blooms will dance, they’ll sing of cheer;  
A symphony of colors glow,  
Within my heart, they thrive sincere.
