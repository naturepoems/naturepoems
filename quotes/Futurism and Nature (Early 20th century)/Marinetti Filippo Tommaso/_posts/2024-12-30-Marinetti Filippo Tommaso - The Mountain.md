The Mountain
Oh mountain!  
you provide an alibi to the truth.  
Admit it, you are a god in silence,  
a stone-based apparition that fogs  
time and swiftly passes.

The unyielding rock  
that holds the heavens by its pressure,  
I shall hear you crack under fire  
while stars clash in the morning light!

In your stillness, I find  
the pulse of an eternal  
that bends like the greatest armada,  
into waves of my own evolution!

- Marinetti Filippo Tommaso
