The Tree

It grows in a place,
    where no one has
        been before,
    the dark pine,
invisible against an hour,
    blown about in time
with herbs of deep green,
    the wail of colors comes
flowing out,
darkened few,
    who would sing,
how that fruit
    of its boughs,
        slow turning lay.

It is fresh,
    prune so quick as to run
    to the roots,
    to my boughs,
    an embrace of love,
        its stillness holds
the sudden drops,
    and the warm drop,
digging in, it clings
to the troubled world.

Let us descend,
    through the pines,
and return,
as rain does,
    soft joining tears,
of pine cones,
    the gentle bright,
till each motion wakes.

When darkness returns,
    as light returns,
    we will hear ipseities
yet abide above,
    where the storm breaks!

And we divulge.
    Air must be ours!
