What joy is found in fields of clover,
Where every day brings blooms anew;
The sun above and skies that hover,
Reveal the world in every hue.
In quiet moments spent in grace,
Our hearts find peace in nature’s face;
Through every season’s turn and glide,
We walk with faith, our hearts our guide.

- Robert Southwell
