A Poem on the Sea

The wind that sweeps the salty leave,
  Dancing o'er the spill of land,
Corsairs cry and merchants grieve,
  Sweet hope falling like grains of sand.

   Within the waves, a subtle grace,
   The changes made like lovers fair,
When evening light gives us its face,
  And hearts stay free without a care.

- Ben Jonson
