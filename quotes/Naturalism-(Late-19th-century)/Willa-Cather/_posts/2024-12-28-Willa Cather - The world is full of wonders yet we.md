The world is full of wonders, yet we take no time
To think of the beauty that abounds all around us—
Wildflowers blooming in meadows, the rushing stream,
The quiet midnight of a soft spring rain.

How many of us have paused to breathe it in,
The scent of pine after a summer storm,
Or the first breath of autumn, crisp and sharp,
The whispers of wind trailing through the trees?

In nature's grand tapestry, we forget our woes,
And find ourselves anew beneath the wide-open sky,
For in each fragile petal, in every rustled leaf,
Lies the eternal truth that we belong to this earth.

So let us wander through the woods, by riverside,
With hearts attuned to the rhythm of the earth,
Embracing the wild, the untamed, the raw,
Finding solace in nature’s simple, profound grace.

- Willa Cather
