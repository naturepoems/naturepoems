To a Skylark
Hail to thee, blithe Spirit!
Bird thou never wert—
That from Heaven, or near it,
Pourest thy full heart,
In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.

Higher still and higher
From the earth thou springest;
Like a cloud of fire;
The blue deep thou wingest,
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.






- Percy Bysshe Shelley
