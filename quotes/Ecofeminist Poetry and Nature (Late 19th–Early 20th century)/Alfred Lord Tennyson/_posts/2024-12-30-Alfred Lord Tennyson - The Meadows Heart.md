How sweet it is, to breathe the day,
Where meadows open wide and free,
Where the fragrant blooms in wild array,
Make love to the sky—O let it be.
The heart of nature sings in delight,
Where sunlight casts its golden snare,
And morning dances with beams so bright,
In the silence, we find solace rare.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
