The Night

What spells are woven in the night,
What shadows pass, what glories bright?
The moonlight falls on grass and tree,
While stillness wraps the world in glee.

The stars like diamonds spangle the dome,
And on each breath the night birds roam.
The world rests quiet, deep in sleep,
Where nature stirs her secrets deep.

In such tranquillity and peace,
Our hearts are bathed in soft release;
For every star that twinkles there
Is a wish that drifts on night air.
