In summer’s glow, the fields do sway,
With golden grains that breathe the sun,
Nature unfurls in bright array,
A dance of life, where all is one.

The gentle breeze, a soft caress,
Waves through the crops, a rhythm found,
In every harvest, joy’s excess,
A bounty knit to sacred ground.


- William H Prescott
