The Morning Star
My heart entwined with Mars, when rising up
In morn's sweet steady shimmer, golden cup
Of sun o'er hills to rule the whole of me,
The Solstice knells, amid the trees outspread,
Nourishing in all the shades that lie below.
As night appears, a moment swiftly fed,
By Hovering hues that quieten into glow.
Would I could dwell within thy waning shade,
In transient grace and perfectly parade!

O light of day, wherever thou may be.
The morning hour, the crown of hastier springs.
May flood the slopes, may glisten in the streams,
And still I hear the shadow's silent rings.
Ah! that sweet star, so ever-half unspun!
When wilful joy hath placed thee on the road,
To all who witness in the arms of day,
Returning beauty to this heart's abode.

- Henry Vaughan
