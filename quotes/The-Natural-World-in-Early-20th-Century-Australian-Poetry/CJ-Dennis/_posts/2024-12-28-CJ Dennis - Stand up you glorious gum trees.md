Stand up, you glorious gum trees strong,
With your lofty limbs and your bark so rough;
You have weathered storms and stood so long,
And faced the sun and the rain and tough.

You know no fear of the gale's loud roar,
Nor tremble at thunder's rumbling sound;
For beneath your shade, I find once more,
The sacred solace that I have found.

In the starlit nights, you softly sway,
In the moonlight's glow, a radiant sight,
Your majesty in the night displays,
And I sit in awe, lost to the night.
