The Mountain and the Squirrel

The mountain and the squirrel
Had a quarrel, and the former
Called the latter "Little Prig!"  
Bun replied, "You are doubtless  
Meaning to be as tough and gloomy as zoons;"
But there can be no quarrel
When light is a giddy hen that spurns.

Waves do break without leaving pain or trace—
For truth must get too rude here.
In every day’s return: embrace—
How little heart beats at the place!

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
