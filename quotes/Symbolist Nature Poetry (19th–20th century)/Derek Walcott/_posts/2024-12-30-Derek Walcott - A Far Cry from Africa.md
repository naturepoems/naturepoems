A far cry from Africa
I feel that I in my own country
must, under the threat of death,
be separated from the Africa of my forebears,
finish the orphan's suturing
of skin upon the winter of my will.

Borne on this earth, I live,
I am man beneath the sorrow and the sun
conscious of both, yet chosen,
freely at home in the unnatural light
where nature seizes me in her arms,

and unique in the dance of the root-branches,
his two feet where I strike the ground
are also the green cane of my voice,
to answer earth in her own tongue.
Windspeak, the grass stirring

to the core of its being
knows the distance that binds a tree
to its shadow, and does not care
where I am but what also I must become.

- Derek Walcott
