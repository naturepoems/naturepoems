A River Runs
Through valleys deep and mountains high,
A river winds, a silver thread,
Its waters murmuring tales of old,
Of time and change,
Of life anew,
A flow that carries whispers of stones,
And echoes of creatures who drink,
In nature's script,
The river writes,
A journey unending,
Through landscapes vast,
A mirror of the sky,
Reflecting clouds and dreams,
Where life gathers,
And flows like the current,
Towards the embrace of the ocean.


- Mario Carli
