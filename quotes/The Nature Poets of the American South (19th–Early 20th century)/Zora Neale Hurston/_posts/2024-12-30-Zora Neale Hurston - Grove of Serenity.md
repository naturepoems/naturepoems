Within the quiet of the grove,
Where ancient tales and secrets rove,
I sit and breathe the sacred air,
In every leaf, a love laid bare.

The wildflowers bloom, their colors bright,
In the dance of day, through the night.
Their petals open, their fragrance sweet,
Nature’s embrace, my heart’s retreat.


- Zora Neale Hurston
