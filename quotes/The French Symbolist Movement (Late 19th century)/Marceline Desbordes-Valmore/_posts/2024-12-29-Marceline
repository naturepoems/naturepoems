When roses bloom, and fragrant air ascends,  
Each petal tells a story, soft and sweet;  
With luring scents, the heart’s desire transcends,  
And in their beauty lies the world’s retreat.

Oh, symphony of colors, light, and grace,  
You hold the whispers of the earth and sky;  
And every glance, a memory we trace,  
A love affair with nature’s lullaby.

- Marceline Desbordes-Valmore
