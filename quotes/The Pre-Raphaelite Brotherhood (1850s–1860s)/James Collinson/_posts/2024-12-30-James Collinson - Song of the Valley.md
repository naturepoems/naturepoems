Song of the Valley


  I have heard of a valley that lies  
  In the depths of some innocent shade,  
  It is bright as the sun in the skies,  
  And the fruits of all life there are laid;  
  The lightest of breezes that flow,  
  And I long for the vale of the vale.


  They tell of the streams that are fed  
  By the dew of a golden-earth flower,  
  And while their fine breath ’tis said  
  Comes the shade from the bright cursed bower —  
  O sweet be the breeze and wonderful peace  
  In hearing the bees burst their shroud.
