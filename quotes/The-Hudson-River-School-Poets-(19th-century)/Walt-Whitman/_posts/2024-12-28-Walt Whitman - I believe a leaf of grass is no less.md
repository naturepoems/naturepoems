I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars.
And the pimpernel's red cup and the apple blossom,
            Are the all immortal, and should not pass.
The fern must be and is the rabbi alone
            Of this world’s verdure and bloom.
The green-trees, green for a thousand centuries—
And the air and the sky shall be—
            One day a flower—the rose of the world.

— From "Leaves of Grass"

- Walt Whitman
