The Song of the Sea

O ocean, dark and vast,
Your whispers reach the breeze,
With tides of time, you sway and sway,
The heart of the world’s unease.

You cradle stars upon your crest,
While beneath your depths do secrets dwell,
In the crash of waves, in each lost breath,
The echo of a forgotten spell.

A symphony of timeless roar,
A lullaby for the weary year,
In your song of surf, my spirit soars,
Among the ripples, I see it clear.


- Robert Penn Warren
