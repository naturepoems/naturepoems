The Garden of Life

In my garden, life blooms bright,
Colors weave a tapestry so rare,
With every flower, a tale of light,
In nature's heart, I find my prayer.

The rose unfolds, its petals soft,
A whisper sweet, a memory dear,
While in the air, gently aloft,
The fragrance draws the spirit near.

Butterflies dance in sunlit glades,
As bees hum tunes of joy and cheer,
In this embrace where nature parades,
All worries cease, all fears disappear.

Oh garden of life, hold me close,
In your beauty, I find reprieve,
In every bloom, my spirit knows,
The heart of nature, I believe.

â€“ Nikolai Gumilyov
