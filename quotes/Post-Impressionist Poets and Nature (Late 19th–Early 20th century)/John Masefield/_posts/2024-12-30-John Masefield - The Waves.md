The Waves

The waves, they whisper tales of yore,
Of mariners bold and oceans deep;
In time, they weave their soft encore,
For the wayward dreamers who do not sleep.

They carry stories from the land,
Of sunlit shores and tempest's roar,
Where sea and sky together stand,
In a dance of essence, evermore.

- John Masefield
