In gardens where the lilies sway,
Their gentle heads a dance of grace,
The sun descends, at end of day,
And paints the world in warm embrace.

The fragrance fills the evening air,
As dusk enfolds the fading light,
In natureâ€™s arms, beyond all care,
I find my soul take joyful flight.

- Charles Baudelaire
