Awakening

The sun has risen on the hills,
  Where fades the misty night,
  And bright in early echoes still,
  The valley laughs with light.

The flowers of hope are on the air,
  And fragrance fills the dells,
  While in the depth of azure fair,
  The melody of bells.

A bird is singing in the tree,
  A murmur in the brook,
  And happiness is blending free,
  With every downward look.

Oh, joy of life and love’s soft sway,
  Let this sweet day abide,
  To linger as the evening’s play,
  And dreams of peace beside.

- William Wilfred Campbell
