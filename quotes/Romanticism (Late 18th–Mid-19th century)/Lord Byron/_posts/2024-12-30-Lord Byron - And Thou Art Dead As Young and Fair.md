Remember thee?  
Ay, me;  
I am forgotten;  
And so our love's  
Strange fate be won  
In silence, artfully laid to rest —  
Where flowers fade,  
And time is tilled —  
Oh, love's essence  
Can be found in the fall of leaves,  
And the whispering sigh as they crackle beneath.

How one moment does rain bring  
Friends lured to re-create lost happiness!  
Yet never again shall  
Time turn its tide;  
A heart shall mourn,  
Though everything must die.  
Lo! even flowers fall,  
That though they still might be  
Must yield to fate, what love might revere.

- Lord Byron
