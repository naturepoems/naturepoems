Spring's Awakening

As the snowflakes recede,
And the flowers awake,
Life stirs in the meadows,
A sweet song we make.

The world bursts with color,
In blossoms and greens,
An orchestra of nature,
In vibrant scenes.

Oh spring, lovely spring,
With your promise so bright,
You bring forth renewal,
In the warmth of your light.

- John Thompson
