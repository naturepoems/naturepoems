THE NIGHT SKY

The night unfolds a velvet quilt,
  Of twinkling stars that shimmer bright;
Each point of light, a story built,
  In realms beyond my mortal sight.

The moon hangs low, a silver disk,
  That casts its glow on all below;
A gentle guide that calls to risk,
  Where dreams take flight and wonders grow.

In nature’s hush, I find my place,
  Beneath the dome of endless sky;
And in that vastness, I embrace,
  The cosmic dance, the night’s sweet sigh.


- Gerard Manley Hopkins
