The Garden
In the garden where flowers bloom,
Each petal dance, a soft ballet,
With colors bright that chase the gloom,
And fragrance sweet that guides the way.
A world reborn in every seed,
Life’s cycles spin in nature’s womb,
In this small space, I find my creed,
A paradise where all can bloom.



- Julian Grenfell
