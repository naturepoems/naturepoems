I was sitting on the bench in the quiet,
Under the heavy branches of the oak.
The wind danced lightly among the leaves,
And I remembered how to smile and trust,
How the sun, hidden behind clouds,
Was still there, waiting to warm my skin.
Nature taught me two things today:
To listen and never forget,
That life is a fragile, beautiful gift,
Meant as much for a wandering bird
As for a lonely man on a park bench.

â€” "The Branches"
