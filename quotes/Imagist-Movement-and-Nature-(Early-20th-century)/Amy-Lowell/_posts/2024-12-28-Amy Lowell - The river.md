The river bends,
A sinuous thread,
Through the lush lands,
Whispering endlessly,
Rubbing against the rocks,
Of ages past,
Carrying tales,
Of ancient stones,
And the breath of mountains,
Echoed in the swirling currents.

A tender song of continuity,
Flowing ever onward,
Into the arms of the sea,
Where dreams and reality,
Mingle in salt and foam.
â€” Amy Lowell
