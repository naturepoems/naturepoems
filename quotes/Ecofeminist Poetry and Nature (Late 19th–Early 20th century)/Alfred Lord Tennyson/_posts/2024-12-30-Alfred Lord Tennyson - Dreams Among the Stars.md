A vision grew in the silver mist,
At dawn's first breath kissed the breast of night,
'Twas a fairy tale lost in the hazy list,
Of deepest woods where the sun's not bright.
Yet glittering stars in the canopy high,
Whispered stories of ages past,
Where dreams are woven like threads in the sky,
And the beauty of nature holds us fast.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
