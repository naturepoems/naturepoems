Let the Boy Win Glory!
Let the Boy Win Glory!
The interwoven leaves
   Of the sight of the willow.
Let the glade direct life
   And lead without fear.
Give we your blossoms to the river,
   Ah, the profound!

Just where the sky exhales,
   Meadow reaches out,
And a hundred delicate
   Drops paint the stone,
Let the echoes
   Dance over the water.

- William Blake
