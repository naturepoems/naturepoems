Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird

I
Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.

II
I imagined the blackbird
Whistling
yum.

III
The blackbird whistled
With his eye towards the skies
And I leaned drinking the dark
That tilted stars forever.

IV
A man and a woman
Are one.

V
I do not know what it is
To wander.

VI
The only blackbird,
Song in the distance,
broadcasts a stillness
That drifts among the trees.

VII
Content with his lullabies,
He leaves.

VIII
I saw the blackbird
Beneath the hidden throats
Of sung-out light.

IX
The blackbird has two wings,
One from the left
The other from the right

X
And thus it communicates,
Flicking its body around.

XI
The eye of the blackbird
Was the only moving thing,
Versatile above the snowy mountains,
With no concern for cries or longing.

XII
Two blackbirds settled
On a womanâ€™s breast

XIII
And the very same blackbirds
Wings cross yards.
