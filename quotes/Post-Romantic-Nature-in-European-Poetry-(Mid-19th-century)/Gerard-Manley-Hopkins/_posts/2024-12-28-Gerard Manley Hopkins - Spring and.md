Spring and Fall

To a young child

Margaret, are you grieving 
    Over Golden Grove unleaving?
    Leaves, like the things of man, you 
    With your fresh thoughts care for, can you?

Ah! as the heart grows older 
    It will come to such sights colder 
    By and by, nor spare a sigh 
    Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie;

And yet you will weep and know why. 
    Now no matter, child, the name: 
    Sorrows of Spring, they grow falling; 
    And you, too, at the years know still.

                                                        -- Gerard Manley Hopkins, 1880
