A Song of Nature

O gentle Nature, whose voice I hear,  
In the soft whisperings of the trees so dear;  
Your beauty captivates, enshrined on high,  
In the blooming flower and the sun-kissed sky.

With each day’s ebb and flow like waves’ embrace,  
Through seasons of change, I take my place;  
For I am a child of both earth and air,  
And in Nature's heart, I am cradled there.


- G L D Mackay
