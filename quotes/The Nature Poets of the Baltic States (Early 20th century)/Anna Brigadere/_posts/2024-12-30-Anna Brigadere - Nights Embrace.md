Beneath the silver moon's tender gaze,
The night unfolds a tranquil embrace.
In the heart of the woods, in the quiet haze,
A symphony plays in nature's grace.

The stars twinkle gently, like dreams that awake,
Illuminating paths where the shadows may fall.
In the still of the night, all worries forsake,
And the beauty of silence enchants us all.

- Anna Brigadere
