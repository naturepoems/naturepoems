---

In the quietude of the darkened wood,
Where the song of the lark is rarely heard,
I lose my thoughts, much like a flood,
As I wander along without a word.
The arching boughs and fragrant air,
Do draw me closer, free from despair.
Nature speaks in whispers light,
Carving peace from the heart of night.

- Edgar Lee Masters
