I Looked Up

I looked up in a pine tree  
and saw a reflection of the clouds  
and you.  
Not far from the rushing water,  
I called a name,  
but the clouds were alive  
in peaceful surrender  
the trees bowed low  
for every sound  
contained a sigh,  
a moment of pause amongst the leaves.  
Mysteriously,  
the wind had gathered close  
its sweet voice,  
my favorite song,  
less of a memory,  
more of a dream.

- Mary Oliver
