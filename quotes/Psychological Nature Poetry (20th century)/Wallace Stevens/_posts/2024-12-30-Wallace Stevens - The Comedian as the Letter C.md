The Comedian as the Letter C

In the world of letters,
Some of the stars arise,
And as daylight falls to moon,
The lesser thing that transcends has its place.

To be free, that is a letter,
With its meaning become realized,
In the beautiful place of one. 
On a winter night as snow falls,

Setting the earth back to morality.
The frequency changes over the slope,
This is where the real and profound will meet,
And what has no need to surpass will love all frauds.

So the love becomes part of something greater,
The view from the mountains must be let fly,
Hidden coals spark anew, breathing

- Wallace Stevens
