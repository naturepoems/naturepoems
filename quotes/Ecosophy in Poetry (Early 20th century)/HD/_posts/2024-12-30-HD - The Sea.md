The Sea

   I am the sea,  
   sometimes with the clouds & sun;
   in ground, where the draught
   falls on the eggs.

   Sometimes in danger  
   I shake the blue,  
   the light of a sun,  
   resting among the pollen.

   I am the sea,  
   ample and terrible.
   Over it flows the shore;  
   my phenomena intertwine.
