The Dawn

The dawn of morn in silence weaves
A veil of light on every bud,
And every leaf and branch believes
The tints of azure and the blood.

From chains of night without a sound,
Each harmonized note gives a sign,
As the daybreak dances round,
And wraps the world in a divine.

The flowers shall wake and greet the sun,
To cast their colors all aglow;
And as they rise, each, every one
Brings life anew, to ever flow.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
