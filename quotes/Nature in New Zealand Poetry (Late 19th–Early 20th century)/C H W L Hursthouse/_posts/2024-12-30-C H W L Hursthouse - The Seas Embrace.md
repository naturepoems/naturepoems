The Sea's Embrace

Oh, rolling waves, so wild and free,
What wonders lie beneath thy sea?
With every crash upon the shore,
A story whispered, like before.

The salty breeze, it swirls around,
In rhythm with the ocean’s sound.
Each grain of sand, a piece of time,
In nature's vast, poetic rhyme.

So come, let’s wander where you lead,
Where sea meets sky in fervent deed.
In every tide, our spirits dance,
Within the sea’s eternal trance.
