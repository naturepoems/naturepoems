To the Birds

You creatures of air, so free, so alive,
With feathers that shimmer in the sunâ€™s glow,
You claim the sky, where dreams take a dive,
In your joyous flight, our spirits you sow.

The melodies you sing are sweet offerings,
Notes carried far on the breath of the day.
In every chirp, the essence of spring sings,
In your dance, the world melts gently away.

How I long to soar on wings, take my flight,
To join you as you weave through the azure.
For in every heartbeat, in every light,
The magic of nature, forever so pure.

- Pablo Neruda
