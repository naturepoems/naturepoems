My Country
The love of field and coppice,
Of hilly glade and thicket,
Of rocky den and river,
Of beauty that is thriftyâ€”
The love of field and coppice,
Of hilly glade and thicket,
Of fields, of wheat and barley,
Of, straw and oak and pine;

And in the long dry days
When the earth waits for the rain,
When gum trees lift their masts of green
To keep the summer pain;
In the wild, still hours between,                                     
I stand and watch the sea,
The creeping shadow of the leaf,
The leaf that falls from a tree.

- Dorothea Mackellar
