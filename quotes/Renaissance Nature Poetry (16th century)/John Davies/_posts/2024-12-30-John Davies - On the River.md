On the River

Soft streams that flow with stories old,  
Whisper to me your tales, I pray;  
For in your depths, the dreams unfold  
Like petals in the hallowed day.

O river sweet, dost thou know when  
The skies have wept and joy took wing?  
I hear you hum the songs of men  
Who ply their craft and gleaning sing.

With flowing ease you take your course,  
In silver moondrops, hold their face;  
Thou dost bring forth the gentle force  
That guides the weary through their race.

- John Davies
