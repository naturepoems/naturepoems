Alone in the Woods
    I stand and listen, to the pinching grass,
    The point of air that passes through,
    Wind, to the branches, as the evening starts
    New shadows shooting white birds. 

    Tall trees around me, motionless,
    Held against the twilight shining,
    Abandon sorrow, relinquish pain.
    The crickets chatter, the stars awake.

- Randall Jarrell
