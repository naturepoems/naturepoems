Fireflies flicker
a dance of lights
in the dark of night,
a ballet of dreams.
They guide the way
for wandering souls,
a luminous touch
of distant stars,
reminding us,
even in darkness,
we can find our light.

Each glow tells a story,
a moment captured,
where silence converges,
an eternity of spark.

- Corrado Govoni
