Upon the hill where flowers bloom,  
And nature casts away all gloom,  
I pluck a rose, its fragrance sweet,  
To life’s own rhythm, I find my beat.  

The summer's sun on verdant leaves,  
Speaks of the joy that nature weaves.  
In harmony with all around,  
In nature’s lap, true peace is found.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
