In the Valley of the Elwy

What a heaven-spent night! A round moon behind 
    A veil of pearl clouds; a silver starlight; 
    A soul of quiet. And we mind the wind. 
    From a slept period clouds swoon, ooze, 
    And all about are hints of silver dew. 
    Ripe air on elwyns made a life, 
    That holy night lay soft its arms, -
    Only the night-call and boom 
    Of the wealth of listening. 

                                                        -- Gerard Manley Hopkins, 1876
