When I heard the Learn’d Astronomer;  
When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me;  
When I was shown the charts and the diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them;  
When I, sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the room,  
How soon, unaccountable I became tired and sick;  
Till rising and gliding out, I wander’d off by myself,  
In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,  
Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.  

- From "Leaves of Grass"
