The Aster

The azure spaces draped in gold
Of afternoon, and the misty fold
Of sunset as day went down;
And the thrush’s call, while the beauty rolled
Of summer still in a crown.

Yet more, through gardens, wet with dew,
Where asters gleamed in the dusk’s faint hue,
We wandered slow with joy,
Till the moon came out with a gleaming view,
And the night stirred with its coy.

Above, the stars in silence shone,
With a light that was all their own;
And still, in the garden’s breath,
The dreams of blossoms softly grown,
And the night deepened, still as death.

- Wilfrid Wilson Gibson
