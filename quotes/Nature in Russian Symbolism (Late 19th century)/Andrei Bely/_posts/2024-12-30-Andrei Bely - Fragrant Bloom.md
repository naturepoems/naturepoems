A world enshrined in fragrant bloom, 
Where lilacs weave their soft perfume,
And the sun through leaves doth eagerly loom, 
Casting shadows, dispelling gloom.

The brook babbles secrets untold,
As it tumbles over stones of gold.
In nature’s arms, I find my hold, 
A sanctuary from the cold.

Here amidst the flowers wide, 
I lose myself, my thoughts abide,
With every breath, I feel the tide— 
Connecting hearts with the world outside.

- Andrei Bely
