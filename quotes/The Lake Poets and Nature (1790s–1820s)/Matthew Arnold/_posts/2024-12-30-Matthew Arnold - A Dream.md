A Dream

I dreamt of a hillside  
Where the flowers grow;  
And I stood alone on the red-rose chill  
Listening to the falling snow.

Covered, drifted, bleached and red,  
Nature flew through great designs.  
I wept with no tears,  
A hope fled from my brows  
My heart beat through the mist, faintly wide.  


- Matthew Arnold
