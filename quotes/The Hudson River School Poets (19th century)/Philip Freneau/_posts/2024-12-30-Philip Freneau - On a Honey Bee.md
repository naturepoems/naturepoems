On a Honey Bee

The honey-bee collects his store
From gardens, fields, and meadows fair;

From morning’s light till evening’s lore,
A laborer that finds its care.

In every flower, he sips the dew,
And carries sweetness to his home;

Each golden orb of honey, true,
Is born from labor o’er the foam.

Oh, may I emulate thy skill,
In seeking truth on mission pure;

And though I fall beneath the will,
My heart shall never lose its cure.


- Philip Freneau
