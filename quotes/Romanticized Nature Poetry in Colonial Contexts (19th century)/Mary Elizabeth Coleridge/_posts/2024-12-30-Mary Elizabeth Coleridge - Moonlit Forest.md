Moonlit Forest

In moonlit forest, shadows play,
The silver leaves like whispers gleam,
The trees are lost in soft decay,
Embracing every night’s sweet dream.

Their branches weave a wondrous tale,
Of whispered nights and gentle sighs,
As every creature, small and frail,
Delighted in the starlit skies.

Upon the moss, the dreams are strewn,
The flowers kissed by softest dew,
And in the heart, the night’s bright tune
Brings nature’s song, alive, anew.


- Mary Elizabeth Coleridge
