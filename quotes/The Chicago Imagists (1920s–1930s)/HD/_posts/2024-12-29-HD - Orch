Orchard  

In the orchard  

trees stand,      

ribbed and rooted  

in earth,         

with tendrils of knot,  

shadowed by warm  

hills.   

Beside the fountain                

the stones    

are bruised,  

alive in the water,  

past the sun  

slanting  

its indifferent light.
