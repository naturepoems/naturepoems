The Bugler

Ah! this dry sound autumn’s heart propogates,  
Each golden laugh flutters  
To burst in  
Readest summer’s fan,  
To dance now hollow  
In sweet wilderness.  
No sweet send  
Shall rise above  
Into the walls—the morn of time finds  
The cracks—confined in amber,  
Life-breath glades sitting wait.  

Soul to brew, and hang forth from a tree  
  Fresh oak leaves bending  
Where nature / embraces  
      Her long tides deep  
Of churning conquer bath from  
  Each dry-pored day,  
As  
    All nightfall sings!

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
