Oh! what is so beautiful,
As the green without a stay,
Where nature's grace unveils, clear,
Dissolving clouds for June's delay.

As light embraces all the leaves,
Beneath the soaring boughs they cling,
The lilacs flourish in the eaves,
A symphony that blossoms spring.

And while the rivers sparkle forth,
To glide in dance, we take to flight,
The spirit of repose is worth,
When time beholds the beauty bright.

With music sweet, the shadows fall,
And not a voice more dear can sound,
Than silence’ breath where moments call,
With every glance where peace is found.

- Matthew Arnold
