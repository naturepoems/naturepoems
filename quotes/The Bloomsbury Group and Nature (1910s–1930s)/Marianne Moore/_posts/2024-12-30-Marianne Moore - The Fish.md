The Fish

Wade in, wade in
Till the sand-heap,
The muscle- and clam-beds,
The pebbles hold,

Until the gravel-gritty
Till the rushing
For us below
Measured, and kids login.

She strands, as the guns sink,
Fast asleep between clasped]
They kneel on the rocks,
Reaching down and haul it up.

It’s a huge dark mouth—
Quintessential but still, still.
So gazing into their bloat—and from the depths
The guileless eye of iron.

Till the tides subside, growing physically powerful,
As sand-pounded flecks
Secrete the sea.

Much could happen, much could happen.
It trembles as they swim by,
No greater order is ensured than what’s involved.


- Marianne Moore
