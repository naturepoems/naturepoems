The Bath
I
Bathe in the porcelain
Of that loamy place,
In the clay and in the roots,
Lay my bones beneath the boughs.

II
I would go there,
Where the wild flowers
Are threaded like families,
To know that rusted metal's grace
Calls me beyond my dreariness,
Where the long stems of reeds
Weave through the waterâ€™s breath,
And out of this silence
The great heart does break.


- Ezra Pound
