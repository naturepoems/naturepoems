A silver mist rises,
Soft and gentle like a lullaby,
Over the still lake.
Birds stretch their wings,
Here, where dreams blend with dawn.

The fresh scent of dew-laden grass
Kisses the crisp air,
While trees, in their solemnity,
Stand like guardians of secrets untold,
Whispering to the winds.

In the dance of the crocus,
I find a piece of eternity,
The sun's embrace warms my heart,
As I breathe in the magic
Of this waking world.

- Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
