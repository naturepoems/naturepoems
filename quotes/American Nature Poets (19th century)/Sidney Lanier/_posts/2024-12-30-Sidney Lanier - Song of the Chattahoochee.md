Song of the Chattahoochee

Out of the hilltops, down the valleys,
From the sun-soaked, leafy shrouds,
I flow as the river, unfurl the glad chalice
With laughter beneath the clouds.

High, high above, a vapor stick,
To the open air I rise,
I sparkle, I glisten, a diamond lick,
Reflected in earth's starry eyes.

And on I course through the bramble-glens,
Stretching to the waiting sea;
I gather the dreams of weary men,
And lay them down eternally.
â€”Sidney Lanier
