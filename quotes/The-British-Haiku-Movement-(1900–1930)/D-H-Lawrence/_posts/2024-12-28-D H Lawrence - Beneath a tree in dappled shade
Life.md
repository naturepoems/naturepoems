Life dances softly, unafraid.
Each breeze that whispers, each rustle of leaves,
Is nature's heart, where the spirit believes."

Beneath a tree, in dappled shade,
Life dances softly, unafraid.
Each breeze that whispers, each rustle of leaves,
Is nature's heart, where the spirit believes.

- D H Lawrence
