I had a river, and I thought it was mine.
It was a bright morning, and I joined the sun.
I said: Come with me, bright dragonfly,
And drift in my currents like a whirligig.
I had a river, and now it flows.
And I am here... limb-heavy and daring.
The sun is a beacon in my hands.
The river was once mine, and now it is all theirs.
For a bright mourning, I joined the sun.
My river flows for them, not me.
But I still trace its banks with longing.

               – From "The River"

- Annie Dillard
