The Winter's Song
  
  The winter scorns the fading light,
  And wraps the world in white disguise;
  Yet, in the chill, there’s pure delight,
  As every flake falls from the skies.
  
  The quiet woods are still and deep,
  Where whispers of the frost abide;
  In snow-clad fields, the secrets sleep,
  Where nature’s beauty will reside.
  
  A song of calm, the silence sings,
  Amidst the trees, an echo’s thread;
  In winter’s grasp, the heart still clings,
  To memories of warmth ahead.


- Dora Wilcox
