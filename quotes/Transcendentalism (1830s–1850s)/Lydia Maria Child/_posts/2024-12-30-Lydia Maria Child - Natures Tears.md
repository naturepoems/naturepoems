NATURE’S TEARS

The raging storm hath o’er me passed,
But Nature’s tears are sweet,
For in their falling gentle grace,
She washes clean my feet.

Oh stormy night, thou bring’st me peace,
In rain, a soothing balm,
For nature knows my secret heart,
And grants my spirit calm.

So let the heavens weep sometimes,
For life’s a tender seed,
And tears, though frightful in their form,
Are beauty’s gentle deed.

- Lydia Maria Child
