Shores of Solitude

Where the land meets the breathing sea,
   I wander softly, embraced by silence;
Each grain of sand beneath my foot a key,
   Unlocking worlds of tranquil guidance.

The waves caress my heart with gentle sighs,
   As frothy whispers cleanse away the noise;
In solitude, I shed my worldly ties,
   And find the truth in nature's quiet joys.

Oh, let me linger in this golden grace,
   Where solitude and peace converge as one;
In every breath, I trace a sacred space,
   The shores of solitude, where life’s begun.

- Jessie Poe
