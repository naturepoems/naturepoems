The bracing air awakens me,
The crisp of dawn, a tender guest,
The laughter of leaves—a symphony,
To which my worries find their rest.

When daylight spills on dew-kissed flowers,
And life bursts forth in vibrant hues,
I am replete with nature’s powers,
Awash in light, I renew my views.

- Henry David Thoreau
