The first soft flush of dawn has kissed
The mountain tops, and brightened all the glades,
With golden sky-light trembling on the mist,
As if the shadows of the trees were swayed
By unseen breezes lightly, while the day,
With kindling warmth resplendent in its clasp,
Hath crept into the valley and the fray,
To bless the earth with every fervent gasp.

What whispered thoughts of beauty doth arise,
With flowers opening to greet the morn!
Each breath a prayer—the wandering throbbing sighs—
Of nature blessed as it renews its form.

O, let us tread these paths that nature leads,
Where peace and joy, our spirit's inner needs.

- Christopher Pearse Cranch
