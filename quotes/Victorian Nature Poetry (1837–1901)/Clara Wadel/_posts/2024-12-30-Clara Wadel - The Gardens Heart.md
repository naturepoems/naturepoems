The Garden's Heart

In every seed, a story lies,
A leap of faith in fertile earth,
As blossoms burst 'neath azure skies,
To celebrate their wondrous birth.

The tulip stands in colors bold,
The daisies dance in playful glee,
In nature’s cradle, dreams unfold,
A garden sings of wild beauty.

Beneath the arch of boughs entwined,
The fragrant breezes gently stir,
In moments still, we come to find,
The garden’s heart will always blur.

- Clara Wadel
