Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp,
   Or what's a heaven for?
   It stands to reason, you see;
The light of the cosmos astounds,
   So why should I lack vision?
Be it knowledge of places unknown,
   Or love's sweet fruit, so fair.
In gardens glowed with simple blooms,
   Or infinite night air.
So, come and transcend the scene,
   Go see the world with me,
For nature's sweet embrace is man's grand dream!
In the eternal quest to be free.

- Robert Browning
