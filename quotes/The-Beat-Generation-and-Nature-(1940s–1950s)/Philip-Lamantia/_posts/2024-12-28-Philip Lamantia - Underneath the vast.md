Underneath the vast expanse,
The mountains hold a timeless dance,
Their peaks like thoughts, so pure and bright,
Reflect the mirror of the night.

Ode to the river, winding tight,
In its depths, the day meets night;
Each current flowing with dreams of old,
In whispered tales, cosmic truths unfold.


- Philip Lamantia
