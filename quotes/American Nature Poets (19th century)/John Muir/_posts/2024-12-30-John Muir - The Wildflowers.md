The Wildflowers

Awake, awake! The flowers call,  
With petals of gold and azure bright;  
In the gentle dawn, they rise and fall,  
A tapestry woven, a sheer delight.

Oh, wild and free, in meadows they grow,  
In humble fashion, so grand in stance,  
With colors that shimmer, pure beauty aglow,  
They dance to the tune of natureâ€™s romance.

Each blossom a story, each hue a song,  
They invite the sun, the rain, the dew;  
In the world of nature, where we belong,  
Oh, wildflowers thrive; let us take our cue.
