---

The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me,
  He complains of my gab and my loitering.
  I, too, am not a bit tamed—I too am untranslatable;  
I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.  

The blood of the world is my uplank'd heart,
  I too am a trickster and a green-eyed prankster.
  With my rivulets, my rivers, my lakes and my skies,
I follow the sun, I speak to the flowers and trees.  


- Walt Whitman
