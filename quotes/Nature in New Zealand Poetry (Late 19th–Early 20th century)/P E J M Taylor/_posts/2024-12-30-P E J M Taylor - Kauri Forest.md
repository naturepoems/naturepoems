Kauri Forest

In the cathedral of giants, the kauri stand tall,  
Whispering secrets to the earth and its call,  
Their trunks like pillars, ancient and wise,  
Guardians of time under sprawling skies.

The undergrowth rustles with life ever near,  
A symphony sung by those we hold dear,  
Moss cloaks the ground like a soft, emerald quilt,  
In this sacred haven, where nature has built.

Oh, kauri, your arms shelter dreams of the past,  
In the canopy's shade, forever steadfast,  
You teach us of patience, resilience, and grace,  
In the heart of the forest, our sacred place.

- P E J M Taylor
