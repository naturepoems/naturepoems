The river flows, 
A silver thread mirroring the stars,
Carving paths through ancient earth,
And whispering stories to the stones.

In its embrace, I find solace,
Where time dances with freedom,
And every ripple carries laughter—
An invitation to let go, to surrender,
To the magic of the moment.

Here, in the flow, lie treasures untold,
Life’s rhythm plays on,
Unfurling the tapestry of existence,
One heartbeat at a time.

- Alberto Savinio
