In the hush before the dawn,  
When nature holds its breath, withdrawn,  
The world is wrapped in tender dreams,  
As morning breaks and quietly beams.

The dew upon the grass, it glistens,  
While in the air, the wild things listen,  
A new day dawns with hope arrayed,  
In natureâ€™s arms, our fears allayed.
