Ode to the Wildflower

Oh wildflower, how do you dare
To bloom in the cracks of stone,
With colors that defy the walls,
And scents that whisper home?
You wear resilience like a crown,
In the harsh arms of the sun;
Each petal a testament
To battles lost and won.

In fields where hopes are buried,
Among the thorns of despair,
You rise, unabashed beauty,
Against a backdrop of wear and tear.
I marvel at your whispers,
Nature’s soft and gentle call,
With every breeze that carries you,
I feel your spirit’s thrall.

— Wole Soyinka
