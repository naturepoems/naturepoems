The Store

I went to the store,
To buy a fresh diet,
And they said,
All we have is dyed.

I went to the window,
To look out at nature,
But the trees wore cloaks
Of the same grey plaster.

The birds sang loud,
Of things they never touched,
And I stood, like a core,
Of a blasted lime tree,
Sunk in remorse, at the door.

- Elizabeth Palmer Peabody
