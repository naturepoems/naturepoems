The brook and meadows bright,
The flowers that dance with grace,
Bring forth in heart delight,
A gentle, soothing place.

The daisies, pure and calm,
The trees so strong and stout,
Breathe whispers of a balm,
That hushes all about.

O can there be a pain,
In pleasures set to flow,
When nature's hand doth reign,
Full luminous and slow?


- William Wordsworth
