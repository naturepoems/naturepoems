THE CLOUDS

O cloudy tides of white delight  
That drift and fade on the summer skies!  
With silken haunts where shadows light  
And the air is touched with presence wise.

In every form and phantom’s grace  
You change and play with life beneath;  
With glances of joy you weave your lace  
And filter the earth with your gentle breath.

Let love find joy ‘neath the rolling clouds,  
And Heaven glean from night’s divine;  
For every form that never crowds  
Will whisper love and hopes entwine!


- Bliss Carman
