A wood,
a deep wood,
a-branching
and a-blooming,
where the ferns
spill their softness,
a cradle for the
bluebell’s moan.

Here the path curls
into the green,
hidden by shadows,
a sanctuary,
a mortal watch,
a flight of the wings
surrounding the night.

Peering through,
there’s a song
of the robin's call,
a rush near
the old round tree,
where mosses lie quiet
and secrets abide
underneath the sighs.

Rest here, my heart,
balmy and light,
amid these woodlands,
where all but time
may cease to stir.
