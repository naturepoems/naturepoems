To a Sad Daughter

It is in the wild, the pensive shade,
That the light of sound envelops me,  
To hold you in breathless wanderings;—  
Through the cry of the sprite  
Dost create a gear of grace  
Beyond the sin that clasps our feet,
The grand pretense I called fate—  

As I sought the flowers which burgeoned true,
Dancing forth from earth to the azure blue,  
To plead, and coax the spirit's rise;  

And there you are, with light’s command—  
Your banner waves where joy shall stir,  
And softly bind the triggers here;—  
As thine assembled heart claim ne’er  
The hopes that flee, when light shall fade.

- Lord Byron
