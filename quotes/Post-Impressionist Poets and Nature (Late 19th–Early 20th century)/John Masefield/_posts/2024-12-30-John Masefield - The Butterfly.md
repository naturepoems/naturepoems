The Butterfly

Upon the flower, a butterfly sits,
Adorned with patches of nature’s art,
In delicate dance, its beauty flits,
Painting colors that stir the heart.

In light it glimmers with whispered charm,
From bloom to bloom it flutters on,
Beyond the garden, 'tis nature's balm,
The gentle promise of each new dawn.

- John Masefield
