A breeze wakes up the sleeping trees,  
To sway and whisper ancient lore,  
In every rustle, there’s a ease,  
The heartbeat of this verdant shore.  

Their branches curve like welcoming arms,  
Embracing life with gentle grace,  
In every leaf, nature’s charms,  
Reveal the beauty of this place.

- William Ellery Channing
