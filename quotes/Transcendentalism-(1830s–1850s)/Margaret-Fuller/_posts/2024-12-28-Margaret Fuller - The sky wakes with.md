The sky wakes with colors,
Of magenta and gold,
Each moment alive,
A story unfolds.

The joy in the flowers,
Their perfume so sweet,
Each petal a blessing,
A life made complete.

The sun lingers low,
As evening draws near,
In nature, I find
The solace I hear.

So tread with respect,
In connection with all,
For nature’s soft whisper
Is a heartfelt call.
— Margaret Fuller
