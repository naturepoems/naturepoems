Oh, to be a leaf upon the bough,
   To sway and swirl in Nature’s air,
   To wear the colors autumn bows,
   And feel the sunlight weave a prayer.

   In spring, be fresh and green and bright,
   To catch the dew when dawn arrives,
   To dance with shadows, soft as light,
   And hum a song of living lives.

   Fall gently, once the time is right,
   Paint the ground with hues of soul,
   A farewell whispered in twilight,
   As a part of Nature's grand whole.

- T E Lawrence
