From The Fishing

I went fishing to the edge of time,
a little current flowing through,
rolling to breathe in sweet air,
catching glimmers,
a heavy heart just before dawn.

The sun spills light across the water,
as we cast down by the river’s rise,
where life takes hold within bodies,
fruits of careful treasure,
fragile and bent;
wonder beneath ripples,
astounding sweep of the horizon 
while I feel for fish in the deep.

Gone where the poles stand tall,
gathering beneath the surface,
rain shines up along the way,
each jolted sound whispers true,
inwards and out.
The universe opens its arms,
yearning now for deeper sights—
i could almost hear the silence,
yet remains part of that fishing sound,
every drop tethering me closer
between that beckoning air.

- Elizabeth Bishop
