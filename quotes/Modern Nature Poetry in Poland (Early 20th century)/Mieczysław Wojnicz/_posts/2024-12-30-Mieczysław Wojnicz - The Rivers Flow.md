The River's Flow
Winding straight through time's embrace,
A river carves its ancient place,
With gentle ripples singing low,
The secrets of the earth they know.

Through valleys deep and mountains high,
It carries stories, as it glides by,
In twilight’s glow, its surface gleams,
A mirror of the world, of dreams.

- Mieczysław Wojnicz
