As the sun begins to wheel away, 
The evening hush unfurls;  
Leaves weave through goldened air,
Glimmers of life mingle as they fall,
There hangs a soft autumn twilight air,
Whispers become the soil while dusk unfolds—
An ending that is, at once, new; and $n
Kind the quiet; slight and elusive strength.  
Nature lines her changing ways, laced yet softer, how—
Beneath it blend the sounds of the earth,
Like a memory slipping from its form; 
Underneath a silence that grows shyly, whispers as it turns—
A dimming fabric of the evening glow,  
To lead our thoughts to darkness softly.
