The Darkling Thrush
I leant upon a coppice gate
When Frost was spectre gray,
And winter’s dregs made desolate
The weakening eye of day;
The tangled bine-stems scored the sky
Like strings of broken lyres,
And all mankind that haunted nigh
Had sought their household fires.

The land's sharp features seemed to be
The century's corpse outleant,
His crypt the cloudy canopy,
The wind his death-lament.

Among the turning, hopeless trees,
A bird, stood up there, it sang—
With no one joy but all men, please,
To wander in heart of evanescent things.

A somber drooping, stricken light,
Yet never losing her song.

You were, you were true—so clear so bright!
A human soul in a maddening throng.

- Thomas Hardy
