As I wander this path unseen,
Through dappled scenes of light—
Where shadows play on the forest floor,
And every glimmer feels divine,
Nature's poetry wraps around me,
In the silence of the glades,
A chorus of creatures whispers,
In a language I yearn to know.
My heart beats with the pulse of earth,
And in this union, I find my soul—
Ever reaching, ever belonging.

- Henry David Thoreau
