In Memory of the Dead

What a soft and beautiful night,
    the gardens are thick with flowers,
   a gentle wind caresses,
How I place my hand against the earth,
   remembering the lives that were,
An echo of existence,
   the scent of lavender breathes,
A breeze flows and every flower
    is a memory, a story, a prayer.
