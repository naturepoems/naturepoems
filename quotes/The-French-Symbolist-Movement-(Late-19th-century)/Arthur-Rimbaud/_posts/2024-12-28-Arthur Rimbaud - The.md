The Silence

Above the valleys, the snow rests pale,
The trees are cloaked in dizzying white;
Winter whispers within the moonâ€™s veil;  
And the night flickers with chilling blight.

Yet life nestles in frozen silence,
The dreams unfold amidst the glisten;
In shadows, the ardor grips with fondness,
And the earth with its movements, listens.

I wander forth, blessed in dim light,
Drawn there through hollows and secret vale,
While my heart beat dances with stars so bright,
And the gentle earth, untouched, is my trail.


- Arthur Rimbaud
