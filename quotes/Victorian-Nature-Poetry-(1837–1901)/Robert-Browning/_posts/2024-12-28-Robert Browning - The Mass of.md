The Mass of Souls
Deep in the heart of the forest,
In that primeval land,
Where the trees stand tall in their beauty,
And the rivers run like a strand,
Lives a world that is always blooming
In the song of the break of day;
A sound that keeps on moving,
With a cadence that leads astray.

- Robert Browning
