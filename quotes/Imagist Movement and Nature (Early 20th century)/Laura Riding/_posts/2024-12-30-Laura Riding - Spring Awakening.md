These flowers, tenderly explodes,
Color softens pale branches,
With a green that hums quietly, 
Drawing intimate notes from petals, 
Holding together the dance of spring;
From earth they rise, weaving loose, 
With whispers breathing through the air; 
Hints and gestures, telling stories shared,
The world around, trembles in honeyed sighs,
Sweetness lingers here, moments confined, 
Yet untouched by time, 
Drifting in the dusk light easily, 
Where petals hold the heart of nature.
