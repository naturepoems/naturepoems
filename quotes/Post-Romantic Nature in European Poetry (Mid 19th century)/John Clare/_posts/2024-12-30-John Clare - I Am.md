I Am—

I am—yet what I am none cares or knows;
My friends forsake me like a memory lost;
I am the self-consumer of my woes—
They rise and vanish in oblivious host,
Like shadows in love's frenzied night—
As day’s light brings them not to day.

I am—yet what I am none cares or knows;
A lonely flower in the woods that grows
And only in the shadow of the night
Gains eyes to see its light, and yet I grow,
And heed leaves jostling, hear no answering voice,
But I live in the thorns where shadows lie,
An unbending stalk of flowers that never die.

- John Clare
