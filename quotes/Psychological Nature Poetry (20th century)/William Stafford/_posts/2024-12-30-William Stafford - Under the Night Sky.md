Here is the moon,
     vast and ever-watchful;
    it finds those of us
         who wander, who wait.
And as the night unfolds,
   a blanket of stars,
         we hold our breath
        among the shadows,
and beneath it all,
   the earth still turns,
         whispering our secrets.


- William Stafford
