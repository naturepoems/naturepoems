Within the Woods

Amongst the whispering leaves, I wander,
Natureâ€™s breath pressing softly on my skin.
The trees are ancients, guardians of wonder,
In their embrace, the world begins.

The light filters through in golden beams,
Painting patterns on the forest floor thin.
Every step is a journey through dreams,
As I lose myself in the nature within.

Let the rustling branches tell their tales,
Of time, of peace, of a gentle breeze.
For in this sanctuary, my spirit sails,
To the heart of the woods, where my soul finds ease.

- Pablo Neruda
