The flowers bloom in a riot of hues,  
With colors bright that dance in the sun;  
In their perfume lingers the morning dew,  
And all of creation sings, 'We're one!'  

The bees buzz softly from petal to stem,  
And the butterflies flit on an airy wing;  
In this joyful world, we are born again,  
As nature's heart beats, and the seasons sing.

- Ruth Dallas
