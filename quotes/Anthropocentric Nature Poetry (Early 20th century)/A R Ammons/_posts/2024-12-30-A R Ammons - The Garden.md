The Garden

This garden, wild and unkempt,
  breaks all my expectations
  of order; the weeds riot,
jumping as high as the flowers,
  the colors spin
like the rays of the sun.
Here life is high,
  tangled and good,
where a bee shifts,
  seeking, where the green leaps,
  and shadows pierce through.
No line, no rows,
  everything comes as it is; 
nature mocks in laughter,
  and I can only follow.

- A R Ammons
