A Celebration of Charis
O! If I were a painter, I
Would have a grand design, where I
Should Smith in colors all thy glories bright,
The sweets of Nature in thy beauty’s light.

Each lovely feature, every perfect line,
Should be shaped to feed my mind with the divine.
I’d take the summer skies upon thy brow,
And weave them into smiles, and tell thee how

All things reflect the glory that is thee,
Thy glances are the rivulets of glee.
O fairest creature, Nature decked in grace,
In thy bright presence, is ample space

For verses made to sing of joy and peace,
Where in thy love, the world finds its lease.

- Ben Jonson
