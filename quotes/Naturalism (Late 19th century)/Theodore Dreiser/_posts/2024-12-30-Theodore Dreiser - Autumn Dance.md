In autumn's blaze, the leaves took flight,  
   A dance of red and gold,  
Each swirl a testament to time’s swift art,  
   A story gently told.
   The crispness in the air did speak,  
   Of seasons yet to change,  
I stood transfixed, as nature’s hand,  
   Redefined, rearranged.


- Theodore Dreiser
