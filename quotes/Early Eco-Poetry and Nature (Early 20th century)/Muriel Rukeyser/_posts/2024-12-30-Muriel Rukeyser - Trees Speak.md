If the trees speak,
they would tell of the winds
before the storm,
before the deep winter,
before the earth fell to sleep.

I ask the stones,
are you happy?
And if you are still,
you will answer
over the ice of your own shadow.

What is the path
between life and death
if the stones are speaking?
How does a leaf whisper?
The mountains watch.

Oh, let me be a tree,
it will sing in the rain,
in this wilderness of awakening.

Let me see the darkening
of the bird in the sky.
Let me hear your answers,
you who pulse with life.

The air calls me in the evening.
Mother, I will return to the green!
