Against the vast sky, the cliffs stand so tall,
the restless sea crashing, a thunderous call.
Here nature rejoices, in echo and squall,
with courage and might, her endless brawl.

The gulls cry above, windswept and free,
telling tales to the stones and the white-crested sea.
A canvas of hues, painted wild and sincere,
where beauty and chaos harmoniously steer.


- Gustav Suits
