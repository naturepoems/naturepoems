When dusk in crimson veils the mountain crest,
The shadows gather, wrapping hills in night,
I roam the forest paths, in search of rest,
Where twinkling stars adorn the dark twilight.

The scent of pine, a balm for weary hearts,
Infuses air, in silence deep and sweet,
Each weary footstep, by sweet nature's arts,
Draws life anew, as roots beneath me meet.

The tree trunks loom like guards of ancient lore,
Their whispers tell the stories of the breeze,
In this embrace, spirit and earth restore,
Where solace is the song of waking leaves.

- John Clare
