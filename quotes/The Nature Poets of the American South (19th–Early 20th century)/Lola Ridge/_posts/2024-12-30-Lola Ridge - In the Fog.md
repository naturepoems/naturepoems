In the Fog

I walked in the fog,  
  And the trees stood white,  
  And the worms crawled too;  
 
The silence was great  
  And soft,  
They murmured of  
  the deep water so low  
 
And the stars were as threats  
  where it feels to be bright  
In a children’s night,  
 
And stillness lies down,  
  where the paths all lead,  
People drifted like dreams,  
 
I heard the leaves speak  
  in sour accents,  
  Where the trunks muttered  
 
To the rain that fell  
  Reaching into me.
