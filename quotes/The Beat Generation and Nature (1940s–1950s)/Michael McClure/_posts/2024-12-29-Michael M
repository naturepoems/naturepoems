WIND

The wind carries secrets,
Through the branches, the leaves,
A song of movement, of change,
Where whispers touch my heart,
In the silence of a moment.

---

I can feel the breeze embrace,
A caress from beyond here,
Nature’s conversation flows,
With every gust, every breath,
Reminding me of life in motion.

- Michael McClure
