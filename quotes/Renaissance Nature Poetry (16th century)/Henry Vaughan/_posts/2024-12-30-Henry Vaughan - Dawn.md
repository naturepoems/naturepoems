Let me find solace in the dawn,  
Where mist reveals the waking world;  
With every ray, a new dayâ€™s drawn,  
Nature's tapestry unfurled.

In the stillness of the morning light,  
I hear the balm of whispered prayer;  
In nature's arms, my heart takes flight,  
A bond with every flower fair.

--- "Dawn"

- Henry Vaughan
