The Voice of Coral  
Beneath the turquoise tides  
The coral reaches  
To summon its ancestors;  
With arms extended,  
Fractured flashes  
Of beauty and chaos,  
Where the waters  
Paint a shivering story.  

Its pulse is eternal—  
A heartbeat of the ocean,  
Vibrating with the whispers  
Of all that it learns;  
It cradles the essence  
Of the day and the night,  
Life merging fluidly  
Into the indigo darkness.  

And as the sun sinks,  
The coral finds strength  
In the pitch of shadows,  
Finding its voice  
In the tune of the waves—  
With every crash,  
The ocean pens its song  
From here to forever.

- David Gascoyne
