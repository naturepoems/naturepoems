The cloud has a silver lining,
I see it.
But my heart is heavy.
The blue of heaven
sickens me, turns away from me.

The wind is blowing
little dreams around,
making pockets of air
and then it blows them away,
leaving behind
only a memory of my heartstrings
stretching among the trees.

- Carl Sandburg
