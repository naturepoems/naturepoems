Autumn

In this fading spectrum,
  leaves and their ardor
do hold a beauty that flaunts,
fleeting yet vivid,
   in fire-like notes.
They dance, tumbling free—
   a bursting swath of time —
   autumn circulates.
The breeze carries tales 
   of longing, a lullaby —
  and deep within, I hear the whispers,
    of what the fall has lost.

- Lorine Niedecker
