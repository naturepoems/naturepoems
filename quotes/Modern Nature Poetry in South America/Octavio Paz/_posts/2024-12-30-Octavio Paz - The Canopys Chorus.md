Underneath the verdant canopy,
a tapestry of life unfurls,
a symphony among the branches,
a harmonious blend of existence.

The chorus of the unseen,
crickets, frogs, and birds sing,
a life pulsating,
a heartbeat of nature,
reminding me of our kinship,
with all that breathes and blooms.

- Octavio Paz
