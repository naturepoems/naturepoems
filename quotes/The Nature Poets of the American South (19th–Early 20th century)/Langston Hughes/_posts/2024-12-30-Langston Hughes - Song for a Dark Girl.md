Song for a Dark Girl
Way Down South in Dixie,
Benaiah, I wants to see you.
Here is the place where the sunset is,
But the dawn is Melody.

Way Down South in Dixie,
Dixie is a Southern place.
The rose will bloom in the morning,
But night divides the day.

Way Down South in Dixie,
Under the Southern sun, oh hush,
We don't hove but think of it,
But us gets left behind.

Way Down South in Dixie,
Benaiah, I wants to see you.
But the stars may lose their light,
The skies may see the end.



- Langston Hughes
