The wildflowers bloom in joyous array,
Painting the fields in colors of play.
Their fragrance drifts, a sweet ensnare,
Inviting the heart to wander and dare.

The guardian trees stand tall and proud,
Sheltering life beneath their shroud.
A refuge found in nature's care,
In every rustle, a tranquil prayer.

With every sunset, the day departs,
But in the darkness, the heart imparts,
A love for the wild, untouched and real,
In the essence of nature, my spirit heals.


- Juliusz Słowacki
