Among the hills and vales, I see
The life that free and flowing sign;
Awaking from her sleep, the tree
Takes flight in grace, with joy divine.

So learn, with gentle heart to keep
The wonder of her light so clear
And soar above our common steep,
With wings that fly beyond the year!

- William Wordsworth
