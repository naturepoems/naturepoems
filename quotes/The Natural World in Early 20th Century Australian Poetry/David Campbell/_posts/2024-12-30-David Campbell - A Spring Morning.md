A Spring Morning

There is a wild device where the dew still clings,
  In the morning glow of the leaf;
The petals drift sweet on frail, wavering wings,
  Where the sun pours out to the brief.

Each drop of light like a promise takes form,
  Each pulse from the soil lifts its gain;
For the world is alive with a circle of warmth
  And a vision made loud from the grain.

I rise to the heights where the stillness is gold,
  And I walk through the shadows so free;
While I listen for reason, a thought to behold,
  The start of a day under me.

- David Campbell
