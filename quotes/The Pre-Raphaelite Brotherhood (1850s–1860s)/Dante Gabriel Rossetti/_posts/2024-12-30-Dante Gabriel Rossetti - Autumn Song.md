Autumn Song

Now autumn has come with a sigh,
    and the heart grows faint with her grace;
    but never a leaf turned awry,
    says spring within veils fallen-down space.

The winds, they coil among the throng,
    a perfume tightens sweet between.
    And our thoughts spring once more along,
    through passages of green and sheen.

Where gilded hues greet snowed lands,
    the twilight stretches a luminance wide,
    in the right, where flight-gathered strands,
    as we lean on day with shadow as guide.

Thus memory doth cling with fondest ties,
    as seasons fold to greet in sighs.


- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
