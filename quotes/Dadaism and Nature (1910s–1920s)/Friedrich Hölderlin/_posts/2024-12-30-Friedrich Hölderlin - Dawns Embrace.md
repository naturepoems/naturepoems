When the dawn breaks, soft and pure,  
The world awakens, fresh and new,  
Golden rays dance on dewy leaves,  
In the heart of nature's vibrant hue.
  
Each moment holds a fleeting grace,  
As day and night intertwine in bliss,  
In the symphony of life we trace,  
The perfect harmony of the cosmic kiss.


- Friedrich Hölderlin
