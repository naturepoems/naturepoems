The Chimney Sweeper

When I was a young boy,  
My father took me away  
Combing the winding paths  
To the town of the old saw.  

So I went up one day,  
To the chimney sweep’s dark den;  
He took me through the flowers,  
Where the blossom grew again.  

And as we moved onward,  
Still he sang his sweet refrain:  
‘The flowers should not dwell within  
The dark and dusty lane.’


- William Blake
