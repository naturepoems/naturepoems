To the Ocean

Majestic tide, forever free,
Thou art the great unsung refrain,
In ebb and flow, in melody,
Of life, where souls, like ships, attain.
Your waves tell tales of sailors brave;
Your depths conceal their dreams, serene,
In every crested foam, and wave,
Beneath the light, their spirits glean.
Behold, the shores that stretch afar
In golden glimmer, azure hue,
Around thee, Nature's radiant star,
For thou art beauty, ever true.
