The Autumn Song

Let the winter rain that chills you
Creep down to your heart—  
For in the light of autumn days  
Leaves famously dark are blown,  
Yet the music still awaits from trees  
Finding balance in the fallen sun  
As all the night slants warmed for bliss.  

Let the frozen lines of tears ring true—  
Embrace the dance for winter sweet!  
Welcome glorious autumn tone  
And casting every breath in blue,  
Soft fall beneath the drum's delight,
This, all is here—a beating heart  
As autumn comes with tales in wild.  


- William Butler Yeats
