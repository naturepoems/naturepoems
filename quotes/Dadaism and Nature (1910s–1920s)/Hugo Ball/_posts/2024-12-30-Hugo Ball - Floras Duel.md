Flora's Duel
In a host of blades, a dream unfolds,
Where blossoms gather in furious debate.
Whose hues can pierce the heart?
Scarlet, azure, sunken gold -
Each whisper twists and turns like a fawn.

Who reigns in the wild garden?
The winds weave stories about flying petals,
While ribbons of morning dew
Wrestle with shadowy thoughts,
Under a shroud of whispering trees.

- Hugo Ball
