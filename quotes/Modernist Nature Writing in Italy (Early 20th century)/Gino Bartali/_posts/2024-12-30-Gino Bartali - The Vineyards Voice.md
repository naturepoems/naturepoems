Among the vines,  
the scent of grapes lingers,  
a promise of the harvest,  
a whisper of the vine's tale.  
Leaves flutter in the breeze,  
a gentle applause  
for the sun's embrace,  
a harmonious union  
set in the rhythm of growth.  

Nature thrives,  
a symphony of labor,  
melding earth and sky,  
dancing to the pulse  
of lifeâ€™s sweet celebration.

- Gino Bartali
