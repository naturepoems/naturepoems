The Mountains

Climbing the mountain, breathless, pure,  
Wings of eagles grace the heights—  
A thrill surges as the sky meets the floor  
Of eternal peaks, adventurous flights.

O, Heart of stones, vast and sublime,  
You rise to the heavens with unmoving grace;  
Each rock, each crevice, knows change over time,  
Yet holds its secrets, its ancient embrace.

Nature’s cathedral, standing so proud,  
In the stillness, find life’s chaotic blend;  
From air to earth, where shadows are loud,  
In the mountains, we find that we can mend.
