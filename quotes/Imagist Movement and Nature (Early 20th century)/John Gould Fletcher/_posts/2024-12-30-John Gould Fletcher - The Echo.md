The Echo
In the valley where the river sings,
A melody of ancient stones,
The echo of forgotten winds,
Whispers of all that has been,
While sunbeams play in golden hues,
The earth breathes a gentle sigh,
And the trees sway in time,
With the rhythm of secrets,
Told by the echo of the lands.


- John Gould Fletcher
