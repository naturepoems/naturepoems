O Nature! I would have the heart,
To wander wide, from place to place;
To feel the wind, the joy impart,
In every flower, in every space.

To see the mountains rise and sweep,
To smell the scent of earth so pure;
In nature’s grasp, my soul shall leap,
With every vision, every lure.

You teach the heart to soar and fly,
To seek the dreams that linger near;
In every tear, in every sigh,
I feel your touch, your voice so clear.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
