The colors bleed into the soft horizon,
Gold and crimson swirl in soft delight,
While shadows stretch their fingers long and wise,
Caressing the promise of night’s embrace."

As the sun sets low in the emerald sigh,
The colors bleed into the soft horizon,
Gold and crimson swirl in soft delight,
While shadows stretch their fingers long and wise,
Caressing the promise of night’s embrace.
