The City Rises

A great city rises,
like the sun over a field.
Its towers of iron,
like columns of light,
stand against the horizon,
a constellation of power.

From the earth’s womb,
the new life pulsates,
a rhythm of steel and stone,
in a dance of energy,
a thrust toward the sky.

And the sky screams,
amidst the whirling winds,
a symphony of progress,
a celebration of nature’s fury,
tamed by the human spirit.

Here, the earth and air,
bridge the distance
between the sinews of flesh
and the muscles of creation,
as the city sprawls, alive,
under the radiant sun of possibility.
