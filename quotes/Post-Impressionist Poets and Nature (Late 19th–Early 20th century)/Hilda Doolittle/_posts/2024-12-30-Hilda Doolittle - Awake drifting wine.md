Awake, drifting wine, 
Through these half-known paths,
I shall greet all, in fervor,  
Dark tints fly.
Upon the gopher’s drifting pace, 
Beside the glowing quilted yew;  
In voices, echo highs, will sonar high—
To wash through the open reach—  
But only giants of air shall wane, 
Among the flow of roots—
For I shall float a flower, 
Whose wanderings will winter, 
In the pass of banished vein— 
Where laughing skies with red eyebrows 
Shall own and stretch— 
With surf and stream and margin that fold!

- Hilda Doolittle
