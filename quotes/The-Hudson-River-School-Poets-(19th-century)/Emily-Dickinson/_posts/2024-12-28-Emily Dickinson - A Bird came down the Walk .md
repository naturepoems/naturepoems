A Bird, came down the Walk –  
He did not know I saw –  
He bit an Angleworm in halves  
And ate the fellow, raw –  

And then he drank a Dew  
From a convenient Grass –  
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall  
And rested, like a Bird –  

I offered him a Crumb –  
And he unrolled his feathers  
And rowed him softer home –  
Than Oars divide the ocean,  
Too silver for a seam –

- Emily Dickinson
