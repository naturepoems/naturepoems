Eurydice

She is there,
  in the river of experience,
  deep where the shadows
with singed darkness
    encircle her feet.

Is there a part of me
  left with that light,
  dipped in shadow, lost,
     and empty—
with the half-tongue of darkness,
      echoing by the bank?

The leaves keep falling.
  Hear the voice of it.
    Echo fades.

H.D.
