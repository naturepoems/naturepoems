Spring Awakening

When blossoms bloom and skies turn blue,
In joyful dances, life anew,
The world awakens, sweet and warm,
In every bud, the heart finds form.

In fragrant fields, the laughter soars,
As nature paints with vibrant shores,
With every breath, I sing along,
In spring's embrace, we all belong.
