The Butterfly

Delicate, and drawn and fair,  
Wings of jewel-tinged delight,  
From the rose and honeyed air,  
Dancing midst the summer light.  

Thou art the spirit of joy refined,  
Loving the world, and longing for peace;  
The sun is thine, each flower it finds,  
As honey clings to each blossom of fleece.  

O'er the wide fields spread,  
Unfurling, fragile yet free;  
You thrill the tender and sweet with dread,  
In every world you can see.  

Innocent of grief and care,  
Yours is the bliss of a soul undenied;  
So dance till the close of day,  
In the arms of nature, pure and wide.

- Coventry Patmore
