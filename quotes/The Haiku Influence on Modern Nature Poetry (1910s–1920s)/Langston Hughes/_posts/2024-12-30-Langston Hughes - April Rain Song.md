April Rain Song
Let the raindrops fall
  on my head.
Let it fall.
  The rain is the song
  of the Earth.

Let it patter on the leaves,
  let it tap on the roofs,
Let it fall in the puddles
  and on the ground,
Let it dance its music
  all around.

Oh, let the rain fall
  on tap, on the heart.
Let it wash my longing
  away, away,
Let me sing with the raindrop's
  sweet embrace.

- Langston Hughes
