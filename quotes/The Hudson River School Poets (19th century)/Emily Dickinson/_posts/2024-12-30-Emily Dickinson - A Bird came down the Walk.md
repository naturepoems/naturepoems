A Bird, came down the Walk –  
He did not know I saw –  
He bit an Angleworm in halves  
And ate the fellow, raw.  

And then he drank a Dew  
From a convenient Grass –  
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall  
To let a Beetle pass –  

He glanced with rapid eyes  
That hurried all around –  
They looked like frightened Beads, I thought –  
He stirred his Velvet Head –  

Like one in danger, Cautious  
I offered him a Crumb –  
And he unrolled his feathers  
And rowed them in the Sun –  

And then he floated away  
On the Air, to, to –  
Where he may find more crumbs  
Or more of the Worm –  

"A Bird, came down the Walk"

- Emily Dickinson
