Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art— 
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night 
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,
The moving waters at their priestlike task 
Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask 
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors— 
No—yet still steadfast, sweet, eternal star,
Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,
To watch the night skies, white and blue afar, 
Forever seeking truth through nature's doors. 

O, may my heart be as a faithful star, 
Brightly eternal, finding bliss and light,
To dwell amid the soft caress of night.

- John Keats
