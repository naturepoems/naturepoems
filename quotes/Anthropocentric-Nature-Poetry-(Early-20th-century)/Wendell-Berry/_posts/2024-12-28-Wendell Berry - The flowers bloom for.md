The flowers bloom for us
   even when we do not see;
   they open in the sun's gaze,
   a promise held in petals,
   teaching that presence is enough,
   a gift that time cannot steal.

   When I carry the weight of days,
   let me remember the colors,
   the straightforward joy
   of every butterfly that dances,
   for love is rooted in the ground,
   in the pulse beneath the bark,
   and the murmurs of the universe,
   which beckon us to pause,
   and simply be.


- Wendell Berry
