The River
Oh gently flows the sweet, blue stream,
Along the banks that softly gleam.
It whispers low its endless song,
As though it knew where all belong.

The willows sway in rhythmic dance,
The sunbeams flash in twinkling glance,
The dancing pebbles sing their tune,
And footsteps sound while shadows swoon.

For in the river flows the night,
The quiet strength, the emerald light.
A world that glistens by the tide
Where life and nature's heart abide.

- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr
