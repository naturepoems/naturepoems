Ode to the year, that with its guileful sky
Begot the clouds—new shapes in the grey,
Who, hinting sweet, make every heart sigh,
And brush the brow with golden spray.
Through ecstasy, through sorrow, through laughter,
The dance of joy in the woodland parts,
With twilight whispers that follow after,
And stream with fragrance to still our hearts.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
