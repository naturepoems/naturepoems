O Nature,...
Where curves the olive,
What light of the stars
Thou hast for thee it seems,
Over the evening woods.
Blue shade covers the chasms,
The earth vibrates with fire;  

How many corners there are  
To your solemn and stony moods!  
How many dreams that you can bring  
Are perforated in the veil!
Oh, Night of sighs,
Betrayed neither by your serenity,
Nor by our anguish.  
You crush my heart,
in the trembling of the sheaves.


- Salvatore Quasimodo
