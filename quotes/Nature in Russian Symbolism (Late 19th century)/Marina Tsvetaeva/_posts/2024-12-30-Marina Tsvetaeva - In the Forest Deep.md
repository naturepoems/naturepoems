In the forest deep, I wander,
Where silence breathes like sacred air,
Among the trees that frame my soul,
Enigma of the wild’s affair.
Each leaf, a verse of nature’s play,
Rustles secrets, soft and clear,
While the light dances through the branches,
Kissing earth with warmth sincere.
Here I listen to the stillness,
Every moment, pure and rife,
Nature spins her silken web,
Weaving poetry into life.

- Marina Tsvetaeva
