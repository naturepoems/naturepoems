The brook sings sweetly in the glade,
Between the stones, it weaves and wends,
The sparkling water, clear and bright,
Whispers secrets it apprehends.

Moss-clad boulders, soft and green,
Guard the silence of the day,
Here, in this realm of peace unseen,
I long to linger, dream away.

- Hermann Hesse
