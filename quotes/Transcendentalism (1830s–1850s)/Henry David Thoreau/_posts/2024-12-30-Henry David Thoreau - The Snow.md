The Snow

When it falls,
    the white new rounding,
And if it be true, aware of the light,
    I am but light and soft and drawn,
    The joy of every snowy fold,
In whispering flurry mood,
Brings back to me the stag,
    Midway and phantom-winged בתוך עולם...
For I am distant and near.
Let me be but a golden greeting!
Come soon to harbor.

—Henry David Thoreau
