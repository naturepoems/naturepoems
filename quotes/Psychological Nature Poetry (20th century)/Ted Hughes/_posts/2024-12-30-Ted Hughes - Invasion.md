Invasion

I
The trees here murmur of love—
In thick grating rings—a bark; 
I hold its tender wind, the distanced cry,
Kissing the fractured sky, strong as fight.

II
An ant, a bee, a moth, swathed in night;,
Wrap their delicate hands in fire.
It grips in rings of dark and bright whirls
Of towering bushes tilting inside ----

Illusions madden with life
But in caves, where tides swell,
In me, there lies a wildness we cannot love,
A fading, herald fire, deaf, still.

III
The flaring tongue of day breaks like frost;
Under towers’ veils my dreams weep for frost.
Here is nothing real, slowed like a spill—
An echo stripping its woeful own will,
Swept like the sand, to drift inside me.

IV
And now I watch their return shining,
Those treetops, barreling high,
Turning back again without delay,
Grabbing the dawn, flipping and laughing bright;  
I stand with my sick dreams, almost free,
While this broken country feels like despair,  
And yet, tonight, circling lives continue .

- Ted Hughes
