A wildness fills the sky above,
A wandering wind brings scent of love,
While delves the sun with golden ray,
The earth—my heart's eternal stay.

As flowers spread their painted hues,
To wrap the world in softer views,
I bend to Nature, kneel and kiss
This life of Beauty, endless bliss.

O to be lost within this art,
Where every joy doth play a part!
With wildest grace the breezes take,
A spirit born, I joy, awake.
