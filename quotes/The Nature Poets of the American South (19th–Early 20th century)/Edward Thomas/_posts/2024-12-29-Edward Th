The foxes are gone, the world is dead;  
The whistling kettle's steam  
Goes out; no chirping from the shed.  
Rarely a breeze breaks; only the moon  
Gleams lightly. Hark, the old thrush sings.  
Launching the leaves into the night -  
You climb the unseen stair  
On the secret breath of the air.  
Mary, whose hair was gold;  
Which sung:  
Thou art a light in my heart.  
But say not true, Mary;  
For we are joined, do not hasten. 
Yet as our night peels away  
With the thought that no leaf steals,  
But bounds within a loneliness -  
You wander naked among shades -  
This earth has no end, says not full;  
Come what will, with a heart so light.

- Edward Thomas
