Spring

To what purpose, April, do you return again?
Beauty is not enough.\nLike the bee, I take
From the flowering tree,
Honey and nectar, 
From the vine—my wine,
Yet the flower does not answer me
And mere beauty is not enough.

So why do you return, April,
With your breeze and your scent?
You touch me with your fleeting hand,
And then move on again.
And I remain alone—
For mere beauty is not enough.
