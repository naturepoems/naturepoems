Dusk at the Harbor

As dusk settles on the quiet harbor,
The boats sway gently with the rhythm of the tide,
Fishermenâ€™s nets piled high, tangled dreams,
While the sun sinks slowly, a fading ember,
Painting the sky with hues of orange and pink.

The lighthouse stands sentinel, tall and silent,
Its beam slicing the emerging darkness,
With a promise of safety, of home returned,
As the stars wink into existence,
And a new story unfolds with every ripple.


- George Mackay Brown
