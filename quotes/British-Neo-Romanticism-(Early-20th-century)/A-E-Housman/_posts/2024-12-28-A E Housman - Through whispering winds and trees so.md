Through whispering winds and trees so tall,  
The melody of nature sings;  
In every breeze, each cascading fall,  
The essence of the wild heart brings.

Beneath the moon, the earth shall play  
Her gentle lullabies of night,  
In natureâ€™s arms, let worries sway,  
And bask in beauty, soft and bright.

- A E Housman
