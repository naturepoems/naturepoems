quote: "Moonlight on the water,  
a rippling silver thread.  
The quiet dance of waves,  
reflecting the pulse of night,  
what does it say,  
this ancient rhythm,  
washing upon the shore,  
breathing in and out with the stars?"

Moonlight on the water,  
a rippling silver thread.  
The quiet dance of waves,  
reflecting the pulse of night,  
what does it say,  
this ancient rhythm,  
washing upon the shore,  
breathing in and out with the stars?
