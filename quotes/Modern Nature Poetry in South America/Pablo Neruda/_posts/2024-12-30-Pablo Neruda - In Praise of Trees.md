I want to see you, the big tree,
bearing the sun's weight,
while our eyes light up
with the foliage of dreams.
My beloved, I go through
a thousand forests,
whose leaves touch my heart
like waves on a shoreâ€”
a secret dance of roots,
alive through the time we live.
In air and soil together,
the earth calls me softly.

And I must follow the path
where the wild creatures roam,
where silence breaks open
to the song of existence.
May we flourish, like flowers,
under the same starry skies,
marveling at Nature's embrace,
our hands becoming branches,
a communion of life.

- Pablo Neruda
