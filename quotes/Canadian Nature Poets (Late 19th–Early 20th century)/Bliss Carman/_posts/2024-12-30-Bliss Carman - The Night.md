THE NIGHT

A hand is turned to the silent night,  
With the stars that shimmer and fold;  
And with the dim that deepens bright  
A glow of thought is unrolled.

I watch the moon in her golden pall  
That will fade on the silver crest;  
The night will not forget my call  
And the heart will find its rest.

So let the sweet, fair air enfold  
With glow of dreams that lift in vein;  
And may the world be bright and bold  
As love’s fine gift shall reign!
