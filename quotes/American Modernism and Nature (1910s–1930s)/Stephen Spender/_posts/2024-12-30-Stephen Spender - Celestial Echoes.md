Celestial Echoes

The moon hangs low in the dusk-lit sky,
Casting silver dreams upon the earth—
I stand beneath, a witness to wonders,
Where the soft glow folds around my heart,
With every night, a new tale to tell,
Each star a memory painted bright—
In the quiet moments, nature sings,
A symphony of light reunites the world.
