The brooklet’s joyful laughter sings,
It weaves the grass in playful mirth,
While silver lark on silver wings
Plays with the secrets of the earth.

The twilight hues begin to quiver,
As daylight leans on evening’s grace;
And every drop, a glimmer,
Reflects the beauty of this place.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
