The grass is always greener,
On the side that we have yet to see,
The skies beckon with wonder,
As clouds drift like ships on the sea.

The song of birds lifts our spirits,
As the heartbeats of nature unfold,
Each sound remaking our moments,
More precious than riches or gold.

In the arms of the earth, we find solace,
In the heart of a brook's gentle sigh,
Nature's embrace, forever our refuge,
As time drifts away like a sigh.

- Walt Whitman
