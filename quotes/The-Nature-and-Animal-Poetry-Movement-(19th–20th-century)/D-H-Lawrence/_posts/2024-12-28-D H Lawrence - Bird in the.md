Bird in the Bush

Hush! How still it is, beneath the trees!
A bird sings from the ready hush,
Out of its world of wisdom, peace and ease,
Where moments weave and rarely rush.

To the brow of the hill, it takes its flight,
A living pulse that beats the earth,
With notes that rise into the night,
A voice that brings a heartfelt mirth.

In the calm and dark around, it carries,
A world where hope and dreams are heard;
It travels forth, through thickets and prairies,
This messenger—an earthly bird.
