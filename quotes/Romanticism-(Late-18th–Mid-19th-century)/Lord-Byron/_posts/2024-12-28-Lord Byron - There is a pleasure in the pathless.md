There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
There is society, where none intrudes,
By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:
I love not Man the less, but Nature more,
From these our interviews, in which I steal
From all I may be, or have been before,
To mingle with the Universe, and feel
What I can never own, but which I know:
Yet the whole world is all he did not know.

I know not if we may be divine
To soar from Earth to Heaven, afar,
Where all is one and the deep sea's roar
Shall lead me to the stars; what can it say?
Though we are free, we cannot fire the sky,
Even the dense clouds hide their stars from mortal eye.

- Lord Byron
