Nature's Heart

In valleys low, where shadows play,
   And sunlight trickles through the leaves,
Nature cradles each heartbeat's sway,
   In whispers soft, the spirit weaves.

Upon the path of wildflowers bright,
   In every petal, a story spun,
In every breeze, a fleeting flight,
   The heartbeat of the earth is one.

With every sunset's fading hue,
   The canvas grows with colors bold,
In nature's heart, we find the true,
   A timeless tale in silence told.

- AJM Smith
