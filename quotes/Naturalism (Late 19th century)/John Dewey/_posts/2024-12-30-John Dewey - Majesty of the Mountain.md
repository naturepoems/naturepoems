A mountain rises, proud and tall,  
a sentinel through timeâ€™s domain;  
with every shadow it does call,  
its peaks where clouds and sunshine reign.
\nBeneath its shadow, life abounds,  
in valleys deep and meadows wide,  
and in the silence, beauty surrounds,  
a call to wander where dreams abide.

- John Dewey
