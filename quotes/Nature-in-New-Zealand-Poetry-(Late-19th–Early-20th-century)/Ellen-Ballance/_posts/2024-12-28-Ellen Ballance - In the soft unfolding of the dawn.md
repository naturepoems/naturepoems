In the soft unfolding of the dawn,  
The shadows of the trees grow longer,  
And whisper secrets of the night,  
As birds begin to sing their songs anew.  
Skies blush with the light of day,  
Embracing the world with golden arms,  
Nature's canvas painted fresh,  
Every leaf and petal a work of art.

- Ellen Ballance
