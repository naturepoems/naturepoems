Pike

I
Pike, three feet long, palely gleamed
Cradled in a nebula of weeds,
Stunned,<br>

{
Reckoned,
For what I know, reflecting the dusk world—
Time dog headed tricks.
On the mantelpiece
See the star on pike skin crystalline,
Crucible of a will go crystal, a jaw—

II
Casting dark eyes, rapture gorging—
They have a reply—
Further down dozing down,

{
In flesh bound figments,
Finish too late; fish can wake cosily
Deep in summer.

- Ted Hughes
