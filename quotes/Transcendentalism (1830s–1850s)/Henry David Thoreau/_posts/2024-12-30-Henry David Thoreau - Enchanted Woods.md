Enchanted Woods

The trees embrace the sky,
Hiding the setting sun,
And playing children linger there,
When evening calls them still.
Let each bird's trill be echoed,
And softly wraps the worlds,
Within the woods enchanted,
Adding visions ’neath the leaves,
    Once meek beneath the weight,
Will bless them in return.

—Henry David Thoreau
