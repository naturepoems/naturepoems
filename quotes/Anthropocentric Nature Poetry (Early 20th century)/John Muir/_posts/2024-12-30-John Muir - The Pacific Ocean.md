The Pacific Ocean

Upon the rocks of this wild shore,
I hear the ocean’s ancient roar,
The waves compose a timeless song,
With rhythm, wild, where I belong.

Each crashing tide, a lover’s kiss,
Brings treasures of the sea’s abyss,
As seabirds soar on currents high,
I join their flight and feel the sky.

In salty air, my worries cease,
The Atlantic whispers tales of peace,
Forever drawn to nature's call,
In ocean’s arms, I find my all.

- John Muir
