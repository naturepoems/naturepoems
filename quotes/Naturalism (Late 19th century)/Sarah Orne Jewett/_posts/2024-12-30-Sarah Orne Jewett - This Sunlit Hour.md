This sunlit hour where golden light
   Doth bathe the hills and skies;
   Such beauty born of day and night,
   Calls forth my soul to rise.
   The waning dreams that fade in trails,
   Of twilightâ€™s whispered calm,
   Press softly on till silence sails,
   And every breath is balm.
   The lilt of nature, wild and free,
   Enfolds this sacred space;
   As if to launch eternity
   In every sunlit trace.

- Sarah Orne Jewett
