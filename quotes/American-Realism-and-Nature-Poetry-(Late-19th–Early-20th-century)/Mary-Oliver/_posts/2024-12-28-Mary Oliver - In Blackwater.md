In Blackwater Woods

Look, the trees are turning their own bodies  into pillars of light,  are giving off the rich fragrance of cinnamon  and fulfillment,  the long tapers of cattails  are lit from within,  and the pond and the sky  are filled with a light that makes  my heart rise.
And I think how  our lives are full of these moments  when the world stands still,  when the beauty lies around us,  when nature dances around us,  and how it all  must be cared for,  how it all  must be loved in return.

- Mary Oliver
