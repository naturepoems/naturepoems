The fields sing low,
With colorful blooms of freedom,
Dancing in the vibrant light.
I kneel among petals,
Marveling at each detail,
The artistry of nature,
In the laughter of colors,
Teeming with life, alight.
In these moments,
I find reflection,
Within the pulse of this earth.

               – From "Field of Colors"
