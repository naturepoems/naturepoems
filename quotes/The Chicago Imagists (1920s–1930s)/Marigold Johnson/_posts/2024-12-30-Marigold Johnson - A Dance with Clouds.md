A Dance with Clouds

In the azure sky, the clouds convene,
Like ships adrift on a sea unseen,
They billow forth in a cotton dance,
Inviting hearts into a trance.

With every change, a tale unfolds,
A canvas painted in shades so bold,
Oh, fleeting forms, so grand, so wild,
In your embrace, I am but a child.

- Marigold Johnson
