The title of the poem: "Echoes of the Highlands"

The highlands rise,
   proud and eternal,
Touched with whispers
   of clouds kissing peaks,
The air is crisp,
   rich with tales,
Carried by the wind,
   across open lands.

Every blade of grass,
   a green flame,
Dancing to nature’s heartbeat,
   in the brilliant sun,
Where echoes resound,
   of ancestors' songs,
Murmured in reverence,
   to the spirit of land.

Here time stands still,
   in the embrace of hills,
While rivers flow, unbroken,
   through valleys of gold,
Ensuring life whispers,
   in each drop,
And untouched is the beauty,
   of life’s grace.
