After Death

I look on my soul but it is gone.
Pale, tired, weeping it smiles no more.
It speaks in the song of a leaf, like a song—
Of a garden that blooms in sorrow, peace o’er a foam: 
And here I may be—like your presence; here; 
But the wild dove is reversed, brown as of old. 

— Percy Bysshe Shelley
