Like a lone wild flower in a garden fair,
As it bends upward to the sky, aware
That life is fragrance blent With moonlight show,
I list thy memory thine alone to know.

And from the morning hills, I hear a sound
That takes me away in silken powdery round,
Where dusk waits among hills, ah! let me stow,
The sighs of your days, to cherished days know!


- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
