There is no Frigate like a Book  
To take us Lands away,  
Nor any Coursers like a Page  
Of prancing Poetry—  

—  
The reams of each two side,  
Through well-known woods abroad,  
And every rest will twinkle glad  
With Paths—and happy God!  

And still, still far we rise—  
Too hight—though glistering—  
If I, but Dust, wound use  
The paths of Earth—dare move!  

*There is no Frigate like a Book*

- Emily Dickinson
