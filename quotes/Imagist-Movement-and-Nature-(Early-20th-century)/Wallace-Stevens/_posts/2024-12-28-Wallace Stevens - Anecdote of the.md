Anecdote of the Jar
I placed a jar in Tennessee,
And round it went, and round it went.
It made the slovenly wilderness
Surround that hill.

The wilderness rose up to it,
And sprawled around, no longer wild.
The jar was round upon the ground
And tall and of a port in air.

It took dominion everywhere.
The jar was gray and bare.
It did not give of bird or bough
Like a body wholly entered by eyes.

- Wallace Stevens
