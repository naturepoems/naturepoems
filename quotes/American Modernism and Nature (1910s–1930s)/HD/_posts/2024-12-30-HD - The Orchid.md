The Orchid

 I
    How horn is
    their solemn mirror,
     a tangle of crimson flowers
      all bloom and death—
   I am lost against ethereal shadows.
   I weep in lace,
praying the death of orchids.

 II 
     You want a blade,
         to slip along this darkness.
  Let the orchids share
   their scent with strangers.
    And I; let me weave
    amid the lilies.
   Day will braid herself again,
   in my hidden heart.
