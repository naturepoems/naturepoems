Snowy Whisper
Softly falls the snow, like breath,
Upon the earth, a pure retreat;
Each flake a kiss, a dance with death,
Transforms the world to stillness sweet.

In silence deep, the trees stand tall,
Encased in white, a dreamlike form;
A world reborn, refreshed for all,
In winterâ€™s gown, a tranquil charm.

- Ilya Ehrenburg
