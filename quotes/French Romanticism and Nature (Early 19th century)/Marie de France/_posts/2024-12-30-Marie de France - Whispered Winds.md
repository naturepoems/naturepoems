The whispered winds through forest green,
A serenade for hearts to hear.
In nature’s arms so calm, serene,
We cast aside all doubt and fear.

The rustling leaves, the softest sound,
Each creature adds its voice to play.
In harmony, we’re ever bound,
To dance with life, come what may.

- Marie de France
