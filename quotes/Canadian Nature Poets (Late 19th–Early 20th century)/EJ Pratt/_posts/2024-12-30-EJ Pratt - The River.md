The River  
  
  
The river flows like liquid glass,  
A mirror of the open sky;  
It whispers to the passing trees  
In tones so soft that time goes by.  
  
The banks adorned with tangle-brush,  
Where willow bends to scent the air,  
And every ripple tells a tale  
Of timid hearts, and strength laid bare.  
  
O gentle flow, you hold the keys  
To secrets of the world of past;  
In your embrace the stars reside,  
In every drop, eternity cast.

- EJ Pratt
