The sea is melancholy,
And filled with an unwonted peace.
It is out of the world,
Yet it is the world’s heart.
Listen!
Nothing is louder.
At sea you lose all, by divine agony.
Also, you find the omniscient,
The immovable, the eternal 
That does not sing, does not moan; 
That is winter in summer,
Summer in winter; 
That is peace.

— **Virginia Woolf, The Sea**

- Virginia Woolf
