The Soul
In the depths of solitude, the soul awakens,
Steeped in silence, breathing alongside the night,
Among shadows whose soft forms go wandering
Over moss-covered stones amidst the woods.

I reach towards the stars, where your spirit dwells,
At the boundary of dreams resting far above,
Drawing the images of heartbeats into the void,
Where rhythms of creation mingle among the skies.

If you hear my whispers carry on the wind,
With each pulse that echoes the depth of the earth,
Remember that we are never lost or forgotten,
Connected always in this sacred dance of life.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
