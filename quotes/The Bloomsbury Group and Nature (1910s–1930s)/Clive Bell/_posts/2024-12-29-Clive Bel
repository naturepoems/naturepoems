The Celestial Garden

In a garden kissed by stars and night,
Where moonbeams dance with pure delight;
The flowers bloom in silvery hue,
Opening dreams afar and new.

Each petal glimmers, a soft embrace,
In this celestial, tranquil space;
With every sigh, the earth takes flight,
In the magic of the starlit night.

So let us wander, hand in hand,
Through nature's dream, a wonderland;
In the garden where our hearts reside,
Under the stars, with love as our guide.

- Clive Bell
