In the fields where golden grains sway,
a symphony rises, soft and rich,
a chorus of whispers spills,
freed by the breath of awakening.

The sun dips low,
its fingers stretched in adoration,
touching the earth with curious hands,
as if to kiss the colors awake.

And I stand,
a witness in reverence,
when the wind reveals the spirit of the land,
gathering memories spun,
from dust and promise,
in the weaving of histories untold,
asthe sky unfurls in stripes of twilight,
a canvas brushed alive with dreams.

- Lucio Piccolo
