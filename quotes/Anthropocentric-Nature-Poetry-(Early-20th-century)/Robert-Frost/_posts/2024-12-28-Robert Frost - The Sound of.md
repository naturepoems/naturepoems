The Sound of Trees
I wonder if the trees ever are troubled
At being no longer the trees they used to be.
It was the chips that had fallen,
And thus cracked and raw with leaves.

They shed their leaves down in their course
Until there was nothing to see above,
Only a treeâ€™s thoughtless loosening mind,
An inner urgency, still, that could last.

- Robert Frost
