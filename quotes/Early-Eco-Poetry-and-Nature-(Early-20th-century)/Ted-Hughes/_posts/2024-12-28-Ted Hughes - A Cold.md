A Cold Climate
I
Not here is safe,
nor anything spoken
is softly received;
every crack in the earth
witnesses the sharpnessâ€”
the winter chills deep.

II
The black forest drinks
in the thunder,
a growl that spreads,
a whisper of time.
The trees lift their arms,
naked against the storm,
a religion that endures.

III
Birds seek refuge,
yet even they are torn,
a truth that strikes,
where silence reigns supreme
a triumphant order,
a coldness cradles
what life believes in.

- Ted Hughes
