Spring

In the green brushes,
  life returns,
ground pulled from below,
    beneath the lapping streams;
  all is growth,
though moments of quiet hold;
from unknowable depths,
a breath frees.
Thus, the dawn, the dusk,
  time slows,
  waits,
    then spends on itself; 
a wandering character,
brought back everywhere,
yet still wandering.


- Robert Creeley
