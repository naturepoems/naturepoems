The Death-Bed  

You are not wrong, who deem  
That my days are in the yellow leaf;  
The flowers and fruits of love are gone;  
The worm is at the root.  

But I am in the autumn woods,  
And the tangled ivy goes;  
Among the trees I cleave the wood,  
And I am a soldier's ghost.  

Mary! to you I trust this  
With my dying breath;  
You are the light — I close my eyes  
Upon the dust of death!  

Some say it matters not to die  
If one is bred for Heaven;  
And they err, for I too know  
The place to which I am driven.

- Thomas Hood
