In stillness, watch the world awake,
As sunlight spills on morning dew,
In quiet realms watch solace break,
For in the dawn, life starts anew.

The rustling leaves bring tales of yore,
Where echoes of the past entwine,
In nature’s breath, we find the core,
Of every heart, every design.

- Henry David Thoreau
