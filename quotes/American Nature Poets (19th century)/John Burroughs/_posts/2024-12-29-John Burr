The Dawn

At dawn the world stirs, as the day takes its flight,  
A chorus of creatures awakens to light;  
The sun, like a painter, dips brushes in fire,  
As it spreads across heavens, the sky is inspired.  

The colors arise in a beautiful blaze,  
With hues that enchant and a glow that enthrays;  
The soft morning whispers caress all they meet,  
And the fragrance of dew is the day’s perfect greet.  

Each creature takes flight, with a promise anew,  
In the rhythm of nature, all wonders ensue;  
The hush of the night fades, with secrets laid bare,  
For in the dawn's embrace is the hope we all share.  

With each breath I savor, I embrace this delight,  
For the dawn is a gift, wrapped in morning light;  
In the wonder of waking, our spirits soar high,  
We’re bathed in the magic that flows from the sky.

- John Burroughs
