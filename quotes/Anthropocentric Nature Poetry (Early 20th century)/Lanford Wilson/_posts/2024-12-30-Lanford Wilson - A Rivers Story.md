A river runs through it,  
the current swift with stories,  
eroding the memories of  
a land deep with footprints  
of those who wandered  
before and will wander again.  
Reflections ripple,  
twisting the sky above,  
a palette of clouds and colors  
melding in the cool embrace  
of the water.  
Fish dart, a flash of silver,  
and in the distance,  
birds gather,  
carving arcs through the air  
in a dance that ebbs and flows,  
a reminder that life  
is a stream everlasting.
