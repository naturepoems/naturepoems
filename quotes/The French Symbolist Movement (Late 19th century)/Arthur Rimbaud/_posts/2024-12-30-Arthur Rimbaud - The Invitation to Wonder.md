Where the wildflowers bloom in abundance,
And the breeze carries freedomâ€™s song;
In the embrace of the open meadow,
We dance to the rhythm of life, so strong.

The colors burst like joy uncontained,
A canvas painted by the hands of fate;
In nature's artistry, we discover,
A world outside the walls we create.

So let us explore this boundless beauty,
With open minds and spirits bold;
For within the heart of nature's wonder,
Life's greatest stories are told.

- Arthur Rimbaud
