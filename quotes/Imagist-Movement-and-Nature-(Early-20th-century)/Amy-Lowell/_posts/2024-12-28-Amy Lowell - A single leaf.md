A single leaf falls,
Caught in the twilight,
Colorful as an artist's brush,
Streaking the evening,
Breaking the silence,
In a poetic descent,
Like a whispered thought—
Quiet and profound.

Each flap of its journey,
A tale of change,
As it lands softly,
On the blanket of the earth,
To rest,
And become one with the soil,
A fleeting moment,
Captured forever.

— Amy Lowell
