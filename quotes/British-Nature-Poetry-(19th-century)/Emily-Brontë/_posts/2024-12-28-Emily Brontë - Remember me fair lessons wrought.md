Remember me, fair lessons wrought  
By nature’s hand, her grace sublime,  
As every twinge I watch and thought  
Is held in memories of time.

O sunlit groves and valleys sweet,  
The twilight chart maps a clear belief,  
I’ll wander through thy echoing street,  
And breathe the whispers of my grief.


- Emily Brontë
