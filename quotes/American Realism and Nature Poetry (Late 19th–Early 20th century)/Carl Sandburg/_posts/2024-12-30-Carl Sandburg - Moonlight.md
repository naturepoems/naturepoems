Moonlight

In the moonlight,
Each star glimmers,
Each moonbeam stretches,
Each path glows,
And in the stillness,
The shadows whisper.
Here is the world at rest,
Nights filled with softness,
Gold dust on the air,
And the water of life
Washing the hands of workers.

When the light falls on the silent earth,
I am held in the palms of nature,
Where each leaf beats gently—a lullaby
That moves like hearts full of life, through trees,
The flicker of warmth glows,
A sense of joy and peace linger.

- Carl Sandburg
