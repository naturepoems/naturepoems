Preludes
No easy way happens
No forest remains nascent,
Life, full and nuanced,
Layered with the warmth of sun—
Know this is the center
And let the wave slither round,
To the darkness of the unknown.

So tread the land like a whisper of God's heart,
By paths of light,
Where sprouting trees salute the air,
And each blade is softened with mirth
While sea touches the shore,
Brings forth the story—it is all beauty.

Awakened by the wealth of this,
Stay next to the soil—take heart,
In the lyrics of dawn's embrace
Finding the mirrored world inside the soul.

Let us be slanted in grace,
Witnesses of the second light.
—'Tis sweet of the sun!
Our hearts wrapped such ways,
As the warm earth indulges our flight!

- Wallace Stevens
