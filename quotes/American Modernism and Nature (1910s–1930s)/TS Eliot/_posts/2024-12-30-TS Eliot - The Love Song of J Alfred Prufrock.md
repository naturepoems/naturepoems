The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock

S'io credesse che mia risposta fosse
A mente che si finge, allor, vedresti
A che la pensosa donna
In questo mare oscuro ci guidasse.

Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
Streets that follow like a tedious argument
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelming question …

Oh, do not ask, "What is it?"
Let us go and make our visit.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window panes;
The yellow smoke that slides along the street,
Rubbing its back upon the window panes;
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys;
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
And seeing that it was a soft October night,
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.

And indeed there will be time
For the yellowing of the leaves and the graying of the bark,
For the time of some back faces that fade into the dark.

There will be time, there will be time
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
There will be time to murder and create,
And time for all the work and days of hands
That lift and drop a question on your plate;
Time for you and time for me,
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
And for a hundred visions and revisions,
Before taking of a toast and a bedtime story.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

- TS Eliot
