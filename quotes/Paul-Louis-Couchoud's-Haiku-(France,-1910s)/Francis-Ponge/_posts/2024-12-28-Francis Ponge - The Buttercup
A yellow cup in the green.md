Catching the sun, holding its laughter,
Each blossom a moment of joyous grace,
In the tapestry of the perfect meadow."

The Buttercup
A yellow cup in the green expanse,
Catching the sun, holding its laughter,
Each blossom a moment of joyous grace,
In the tapestry of the perfect meadow.

- Francis Ponge
