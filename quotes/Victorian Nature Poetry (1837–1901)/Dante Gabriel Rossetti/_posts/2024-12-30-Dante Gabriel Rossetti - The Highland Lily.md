The Highland Lily
In echoes of the rolling hills,  
A lily sways where soft wind fills;  
With glances cast above the brook,  
In nature’s heart, every look.

In twilight hours of soft embrace,  
Like lingering dreams in hidden space;  
To sing of love in secret bloom,  
Where whispers sway in nature’s room.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
