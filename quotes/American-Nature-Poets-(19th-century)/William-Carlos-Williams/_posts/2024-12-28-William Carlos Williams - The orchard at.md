The orchard at evening

When I see the distant
apple trees

in the glow of late sun,
I know there is beauty

that does not speak, that
remains as is,

and in the still air
I feel my heartbeat

match the pulse of the plants,

each leaf breathing
as I walk through.

I hold my breath.

Nothing disturbs this peace.

Only the orchard at evening.


- William Carlos Williams
