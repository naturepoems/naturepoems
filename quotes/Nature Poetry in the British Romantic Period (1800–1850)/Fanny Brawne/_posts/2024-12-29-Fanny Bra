The Starlit Night

Oh night of stars, deep and wide,  
My heart is lighted with thy glow,  
As I read the lightest sigh of earthy tide,  
And join thy glow at every flow.  
On this path of silver light,  
I wander like the winds that lose,  
With every step I take thy heights in flight,
A truth that speaks no more to lose.  
Thy calmness heeds my thoughts away,
Dewdrops fall with the morning’s hue,
And as I revel in thy light array,
In thine embrace my heart ah, too!


- Fanny Brawne
