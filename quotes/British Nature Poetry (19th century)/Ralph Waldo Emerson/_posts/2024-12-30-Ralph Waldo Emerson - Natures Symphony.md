The whisper of the wind in trees,
The rustle of the autumn leaves;
A symphony of nature’s art,
Played gently on the human heart.

Each breeze that passes, soft and sweet,
Carries the pulse of earth’s heartbeat;
In every leaf, in every flower,
Lies hidden wisdom, power, and dower.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
