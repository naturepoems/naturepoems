The silver moon in midnight’s shroud,
Illuminates the night with grace.
The stars emerge, a jeweled crowd,
In elegance they take their place.

The nightingale sings soft and clear,
A melody that fills the air.
In nature’s peace, there’s naught to fear,
As dreams awaken, tempests wear.

- Marie de France
