We shall never cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.

Through the unknown, remembered gate
When we came to a small estate
In the unending summer of the sun,
We will find it true, the autumn is come.

But the beauty will never fade, 
Life will spin another web of green. 
When we know what is left unmade,
We will learn what we've not seen.


- Philip Larkin
