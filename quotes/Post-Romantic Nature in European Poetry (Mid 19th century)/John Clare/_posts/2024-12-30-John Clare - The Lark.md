The Lark

The lark is up to greet the morn,
And in the azure's sparkling glow;
With rising song and wings adorned
The woods, and hills, and valleys know.

Its notes float high, and heart’s sweet cheer
It sends abroad from skies above,
That nature teems with blighter cheer,
While sweetness whispers all its love.

Go, gaily soar, thou child of light,
And sing the joy of freedom’s sky;
So long as blooms each fair delight,
May song and lark together fly!

- John Clare
