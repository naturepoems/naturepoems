The Morning Fog

The morning fog wraps the land in mystery,
A ghostly shroud upon the sleeping fields,
Where the silhouettes of trees loom tall,
And every whisper of the wind carries,
A promise of awakening beneath the surface.

Within the hushed stillness lies a charm,
As nature pauses, holding its breath,
Waiting for the sun to break through,
And in that moment of gentle reveal,
Life stirs, bright and vibrant, like a tale retold.


- George Mackay Brown
