I am revising
   Just for today.
   Am I alive?  
   I’m still alive.
   The trees are laughing.  
   I am dreaming silently.
   For as long as I can remember,
   I have always moved with the wind.
   What do you want of me?  
   I am free to breathe.
   I am new in this breathing.
   Breathe in, breathe out —
   I am alive today.

- Sylvia Plath
