The Knave of Hearts,
  He stole the Queen,
  Your fond manhood so tires,
  By tricks, devices and wiles.
  He stole the Queen,
  And wove her in your fate.
  An eye, a hand,
  A kiss, a smile,
  A crown of sop on the lonesome wood:

Where sunlight crests the verdant brow
  Of the blue hill,
  Where the blue hill has dribbled down,
  And rolled in a rock,
  A turtle dove's
  Flight to heaven be sweet.

- William Hazlitt
