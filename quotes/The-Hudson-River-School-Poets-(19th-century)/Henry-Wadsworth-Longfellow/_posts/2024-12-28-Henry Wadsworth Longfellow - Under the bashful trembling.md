Under the bashful, trembling leaves
The shadows fall like a soft embrace;
And nature whispers in her eves,
Chasing the echo of night's grace.

In every glen, at duskâ€™s first call,
The world wears soft, sweet shades of blue;
And dreams in silence lie with all,
So fresh, so pure, and once more new.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
