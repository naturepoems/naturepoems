Briar

Briar, thorny and wind-tossed,
Cloaked in the shade of a hallowed night,
Your roots bathe in the tangled soil,
While the moon finds her garden of glass,:

A small round warmth in the chill stars.
Fingers clasped in the matted hide,
I feel how the dark world lingers, and sighs,
As the scent dangles on the furls of pride.

And if I too bend by the marshlands,
All the suspect rays spun from you
Will seem like butterflies in a sun-borne net,
Fluttering on hopes that once shone true.

- John Crowe Ransom
