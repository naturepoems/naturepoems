Evening falls
With a tender sigh,
Painting the horizon
In rich colors;
The earth, a canvas,
Breathes softly,
As the sky grows calm,
And the world softens,
Filling with the pulse
Of twilight's dream.

So we walk,
Hand in hand,
Through the endless hush,
With the beauty of nature,
A bittersweet lullaby.


- William Carlos Williams
