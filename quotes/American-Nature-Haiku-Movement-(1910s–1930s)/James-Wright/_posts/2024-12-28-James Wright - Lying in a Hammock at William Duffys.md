Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy’s Farm
Over my head, I see the bronze butterfly,
Asleep on the black trunk,  
Blowing like a leaf in the rain.
In the distance, I can hear  
The ascending shout of the cow  
And the longing of the wild goose  
As the sun sets.
The old horse slips from the  
Long shadows of the barn,  
Walking with great ceremonial,  
Until I am the only one left in the room.
The world changes around me, hovering  
Like a large bird over a golden field.
