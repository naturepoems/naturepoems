May

I
  O heaven, how sweet is the tree!
     Anoint’d by summer's gentle kiss,
     Each branch sways softly in the breeze,
     The world awakens, fleeting bliss.

II
  In wildest green, the leaves entwine,
     A sanctuary where I shall sleep,
     Where buds and blooms in slumber shine,
     My heart in nature’s arms will keep.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
