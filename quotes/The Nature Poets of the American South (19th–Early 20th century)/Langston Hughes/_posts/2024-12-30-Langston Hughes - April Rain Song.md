April Rain Song
Let the rain kiss you.
Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops.
Let the rain sing you a lullaby.

The rain is a blessing.
The clouds are a gift.
It ends the droughts,
inspiring green to bloom.

Let the rain kiss you.
The rain is made of dreams and wishes.
It paints the world in silver and turns the tired brown
into a shimmering green and gold.



- Langston Hughes
