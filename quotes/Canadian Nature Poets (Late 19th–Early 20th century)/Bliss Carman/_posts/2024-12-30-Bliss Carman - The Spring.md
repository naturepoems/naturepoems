THE SPRING

The earth is crowned with Beauty’s gold  
That buds and smiles in the morn;  
The daylight spreads and stills the cold,  
And life itself is born.

The hills in purple turn to green  
Wherever the yellow thaw;  
The water shines with a sunny sheen  
And moves with a dreamy draw.

The stars have fled from the tear of night  
In the golden crown of day,  
And lost in the river of time and light  
Life’s waters flow away.
