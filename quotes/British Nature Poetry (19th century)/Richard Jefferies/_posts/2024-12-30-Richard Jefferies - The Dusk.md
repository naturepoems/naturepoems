The Dusk
As evening bids the sun goodnight,

And shadows stretch with fading light,

A painter spills the colors deep,

And calls the world to rest and sleep.

In dusky hills, in twilight glow,

The secrets of the night bestow,

The stars come forth in gleaming rows,

To keep their watch as daylight goes.

- Richard Jefferies
