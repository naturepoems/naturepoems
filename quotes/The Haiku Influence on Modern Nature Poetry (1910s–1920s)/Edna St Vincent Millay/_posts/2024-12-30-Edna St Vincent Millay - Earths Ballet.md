There is something in the air, a stirring, a pulse,
As the trees sway and breathe like old friends reuniting.
Each wind-laden whisper, each leaf a soft waltz,
Nature’s ballet, where spirits invite-ing.
Let each step be lighter, as I dance to the flow,
In this circle of earth, where all hearts are igniting.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
