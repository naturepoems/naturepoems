Each season turns, a wheel of time,
In nature’s rhythm, life’s sweet rhyme.
From winter’s chill to summer’s grace,
In every change, we find our place.

The autumn leaves, like gold they fall,
A blanket rich, a soft enthrall;
In every cycle, beauty calls,
While nature’s canvas never stalls.

- Elin Wägner
