quote: "In the midst of winter's chill, deep and still,
The trees are agents of the light and the dark, 
Their branches curl, embracing the crisp air, 
Each breath holds the secret of the coming thaw, 
A promise made in silence beneath the snow."

In the midst of winter's chill, deep and still,
The trees are agents of the light and the dark, 
Their branches curl, embracing the crisp air, 
Each breath holds the secret of the coming thaw, 
A promise made in silence beneath the snow.

- Wallace Stevens
