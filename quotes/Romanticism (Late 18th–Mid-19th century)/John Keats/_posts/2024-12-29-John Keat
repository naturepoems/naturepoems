The Human Seasons

Four seasons fill the measure of the year;
  There are four seasons in the mind of man:
He has his Winter, when he is contemplative;
  His Spring, when he is in a delight;
His Summer, when mirth does abound;
  And his Autumn, when nostalgia is found.

The seasons of man's life move upon
  In perfect harmony, like the air,
And thus to Life’s seasons all hearts respond,
  There is no season without love's care.

Yet it is Autumn that speaks to all hearts;
  A warmth longed for in solitude’s return;
In every heart breathe the words of a song,
  A lyric of joy shall so soon be born.

- John Keats
