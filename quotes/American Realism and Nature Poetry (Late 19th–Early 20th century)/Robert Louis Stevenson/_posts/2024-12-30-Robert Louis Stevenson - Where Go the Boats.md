Where Go the Boats?
Dark brown is the river,  
       Golden is the sand;  
It flows along for ever,  
       With trees on either hand.

Green leaves a-floating,  
       Castles of the foam,  
Boats of mine a-dodging,  
       Where shall we come home?

On goes the river,  
       And out past the mill,  
Away down the valley,  
       Away down the hill.

The river and the sky  
       Meet in a golden line,  
But I sail on forever,  
       And knows not where I shine.




- Robert Louis Stevenson
