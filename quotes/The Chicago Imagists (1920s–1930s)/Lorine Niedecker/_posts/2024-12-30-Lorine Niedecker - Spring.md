Spring

The new woods house them —
   squirrels, a beauty of grain.
In the feel of brown earth
   they rip at roots,
      rattle the air.
As under shadows they leap,
   I am envious the fading green blooms.
May hours drip seconds,
   but yet, those blurred pictures, 
   palms pressing freely against each other 
       —
     that’s the essence of spring.

- Lorine Niedecker
