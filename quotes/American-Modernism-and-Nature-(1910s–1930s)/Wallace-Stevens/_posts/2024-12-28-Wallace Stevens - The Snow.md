The Snow Man
One must have a mind of winter
To regard the frost and the boughs
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;
And have been cold a long time
To behold the junipers shagged with ice,
The spruces rough in the distant glitter
Of the January sun; and not to think
Of any misery in the sound of the wind,
That is the sound of the land full of the same
Mind of winter that is collecting itself
Into the ridges of the pine-trees
And the perspectives of the sky;
That is, to look at the snow
And the pine-trees without thinking
Of the suffering of others.

But to regard the boughs
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow
And not to think
Of any misery in the sound of the wind,
That is to be cold and pure;

- Wallace Stevens
