To wander through the fragrant glades,
On sun-kissed slopes and meadows fair,
With violets hidden in the shades,
A rapture wakes; the summerâ€™s air.

Let the world pass on in haste;
My heart shall beat with every breeze,
And hold in trust the life I taste
In every flower and twilight tease.

- George Edward Woodberry
