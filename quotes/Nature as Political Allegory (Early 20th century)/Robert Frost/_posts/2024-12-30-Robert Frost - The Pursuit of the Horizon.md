I saw a man pursuing the horizon;
Round and round they sped.
I was disturbed at this;
But as they ran, I ran after.

With the rest I had, I aimed lowâ€”
I had a broken lamp,
And then the victor cried out to the rest,
'We have to go back.'

I ran after it, and at last,
I found myself running alone,
Where the ground itself had succumbed
To the haunting grasp of the sky.

I saw the sun beyond the brim,
And as I strained to reach it soon,
A creature of dark rime appeared,
And drew back into the night from the view.

And thus, so often I chased away,
Only to find I never can stay.

- Robert Frost
