The Soul should always have the rhythm  
Of a beautiful night –  
Where stars are locked in harmony  
With nature’s instant light;  

As every evening Echo  
Breathes its wisdom clear,  
The beauty of the silence  
Awaits the presence dear.  

Oh, let us wander through the Woods  
And reign above the seas;  
To dance upon the cobblestones  
And pray upon our knees.  

"The Soul should always have the rhythm"

- Emily Dickinson
