The Fire of Drift-Wood
By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

...  and the wayward fire,
Flashing through splendors of ignited trees,
Charmed and caressed with sorrowful laughter,  
Yet spurned and tossed amid mountain blooms.
It leaps through the air, and then returns,  
To memory’s gaze, such foreign sights,  
Oft lost in ocean nights;
For when all is calmed, not alone do I stand 
To witness its dance of frolic and mischief,
In a fit of caprice and wild repinement.
