The Woods,” as I walked alone,
  I thought I heard the rain;
But it was only withering leaves
  That rustled on the plain.

I said, “Shall I go back, and seat
  Me in the forest fane?
I will for verity that finds
  A leaf, but finds not rain.”

Oh, none of us shall know, dear soul,
  So long as we remain.
What falls upon our hidden hearts
  As a rain falls on the plain.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
