The birds scatter,
A hush falls over;
A single flight
Makes a pattern in the sky,
As sun drops low to meet
The horizon.
Leaves shift, golden and crisp—
The sound of whispers,
Nature’s lullaby pierces
The dull throb of existence.
Twilight bends, and we draw
Closer, the world vibrating
Where earth meets air.
We watch the light pulse,
Shaping shadows, unveiling
Moments caught in wings.  
We thread together.
Ah, to fly, even if only in thought.

- Margaret Atwood
