The MOTHER
 
The trees have lost
their leaves,
this is my decay.  

I stand alone,
floating in the air,
white in my sorrow,
alone this hollow ground.

I mark my passage,
I mark my realm.I yield my fate  
in the curves of the earth.

My heart is a flower,
I so desire the bloom;
I need the earth,
I return to seeds,
I melt in the quiet.  

I follow the spring, 
let each bud be my love,
one whispered word,
one soft glance. 

It is the way of the garden,
where the dark meets the sun,
my only salvation.

- HD Hilda Doolittle
