Each evening as the sun dips low,
its golden rays kiss the horizon,
painting the sky in brush strokes of fire,
a celestial artist at work.

I sit beneath the great canvas,
watching the colours merge and swirl,
feeling my heart as a feather,
light and unanchored,
ready to soar into the night.

Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
