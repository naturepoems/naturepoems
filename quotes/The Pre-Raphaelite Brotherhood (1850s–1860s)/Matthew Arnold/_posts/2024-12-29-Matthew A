To warblers trilling over the stream,  
With every note so lightly pressed;  
In cold, bright days where stillness gleams,  
A thousand dreams shall find their rest.  

These sounds shall wrap me in repose,  
Beneath the hills where the violets hide,  
And all my thoughts in silver flow  
Remind me of the world outside.  

So let me linger in the song,  
Where nature will impart her grace;  
And in these arms I shall belong,  
In the everlasting embrace.

- Matthew Arnold
