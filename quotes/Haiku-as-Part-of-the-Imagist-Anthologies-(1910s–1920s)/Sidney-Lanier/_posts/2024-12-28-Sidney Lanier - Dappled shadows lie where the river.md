quote: "Dappled shadows lie where the river bends,  
A soft murmur of leaves in the wind,  
Where the journey of life begins and ends,  
In nature's arms, the world rescinds."

Dappled shadows lie where the river bends,  
A soft murmur of leaves in the wind,  
Where the journey of life begins and ends,  
In nature's arms, the world rescinds.
