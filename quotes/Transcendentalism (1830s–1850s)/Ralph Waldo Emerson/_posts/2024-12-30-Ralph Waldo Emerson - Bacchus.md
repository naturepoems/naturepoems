Bacchus

O spirit of wine!  
Rose and gold, you blend  
Into the very plate of the heart,  
In undying laughter, lauded joys  
Infused with laughing life at every turn —  
The grapes you pluck from the boughs,  
In sweet surrender, going round.  

Wild and open for this feast,  
Let us dance until the dim light fades  
And the stars wink to the night;  
Wine that holds the summer light,  
And gold that binds us,  
Curled in centuries of tomorrows a-bloom,  
Hear us call your name;  
One fold, to list a story,  
Share the rapture of the endless chorus!

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
