The sunrise paints the world anew,
With strokes of amber, gold, and blue;
A canvas spread in the gentle morn,
From the birthing light, a day is born.

The chirping birds weave melodies sweet,
As nature awakes, so complete;
In this symphony, my heart resides,
In harmony with the world, as it bides.


- Henry James
