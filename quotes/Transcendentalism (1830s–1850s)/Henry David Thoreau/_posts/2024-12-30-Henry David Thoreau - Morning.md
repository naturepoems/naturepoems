Morning

Ease me into gentleness,
    Let me rise with the sun,
To dance upon the earth,
And listen to the stillness.
Fevered layers fall from passion's seams,
Morning murmurs low but clear,
And wakes both heart and hand.

I will breathe in all the wonders,
    The quiet joy endures,
Let me be where dew drops linger,
To drink their treasures in,
The sun has dissolved its rays,
Evokes in all the nature's plays.

—Henry David Thoreau
