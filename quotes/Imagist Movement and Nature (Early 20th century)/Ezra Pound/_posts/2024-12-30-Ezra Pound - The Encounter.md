The Encounter
The dark was pregnant with bright stars for hours,
A wind stirred up the falling bloom,
For there, near the creased boughs,
A shape moved lithe in stillness and fled.
A soul that broke with overium sights,
In silence bled luminous wine,
From a noble chamber as theirs freed each weight.
For let the songs be similar, renewed and lost.
As we sing like torrents and turning rains,
The natural landscape brought to lightâ€”
Behold! These blooms release hidden tracks amid the dark.

- Ezra Pound
