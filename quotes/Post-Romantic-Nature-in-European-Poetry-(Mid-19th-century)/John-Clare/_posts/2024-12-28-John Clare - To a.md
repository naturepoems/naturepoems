To a Tree

O tree, where I once played so gay,
With limbs that we climbed in the sun;
Through the leaves that whisper in play,
Your shade gave shelter, and joy begun.

In every rustling leaf I hear,
The echoes of laughter and bliss;
In your branches finds my heart a cheer,
In your presence, my childhoodâ€™s kiss.

- John Clare
