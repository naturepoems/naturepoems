Frosted Morn
Awake, dear world, to crystal light,
a frosty breath adorns the morn,
soft twinkling jewels, a pure delight,
where winter’s kiss has gently born.

The branches wear their glistening crowns,
while whispers float on the ling’ring chill;
a shimmering beauty of white gowns,
a frozen beauty, peaceful and still.

In the soft silence, life holds tight,
a promise wrapped in nature’s care,
in frosted realms, the heart takes flight,
a winter's dawn beyond compare.


- Thomas S P S Munch
