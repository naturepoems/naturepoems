The glimmer of the stars dost gleam  
Upon the river's breast,  
While twilight's night comes forth to dream,  
And Nature's heart finds rest.

Upon that bosom’s reach, I lay  
And wander in my mind;  
To brush the soft, divine array,  
Of every leaf entwined.

Embraced in night, wrapped in the light,  
The world suspends its breath;  
As whispered tales of fate tonight  
Bring light to life and death.

For deep within that stillness dwells,  
A burden justly born;  
And Nature's secrets ever tells  
The truths that break the morn.
