O winds of the West!  
O you gales of the South!  
Whispering breezes that dance round the mountains,  
Circling forest, moonbeams that bend over rivers—  
Whose tune does not forget to return to me,  
As the seasons continue to turn.  
The crest of the earth shall teach us the truth,  
While the winds breathe melodies.

- Walt Whitman
