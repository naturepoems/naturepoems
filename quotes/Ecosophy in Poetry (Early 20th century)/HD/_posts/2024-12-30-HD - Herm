Hermes of the Way

Beneath the arch of trees,
Green shadows twine,
Where the spill of light dances
And flowers greet the sun's grace.

Protector—guide the path, 
A gentle twist, a call of the wild,
As every bend in the road, 
Unfolds another story,
Yet to be known.
The essence converging in time, 
To air and earth.

Come forth, Hermes, 
Sway the winds, 
And whisper where spirits fly—
Open the way to the unknown.
To you, the keeper of dreams.
