The mountain’s silhouette,
imposing against the indigo sky,
a witness to time,
a storyteller of the ancient,
a canvas fraught with memories.

Let the winds carry the stories,
a torrent of cries and whispers
through crevices unexplored,
every echo a testament
to what has come to pass;
a heart beats in each boulder,
a life ingrained in the rock.

- Elio Pagliarani
