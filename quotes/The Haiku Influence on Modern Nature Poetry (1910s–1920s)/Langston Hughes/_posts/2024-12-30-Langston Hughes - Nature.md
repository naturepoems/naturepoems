Nature
The trees are all ruffled
With the wind upon their leaves 
And the grass is whispering,
And the water runs soft.

The sun is all golden,
And the clouds float by
Like dreams across the heavens,
The sky has the hue of a pond,
While the flowers nod their heads.

Nature sways back and forth,
In the breeze that dances all around,
Come and listen to her voice,
For she has much to say.

- Langston Hughes
