author: WS Merwin
quote: "I walk beside the river, entranced,
Awed by the flow that carries not
Just the memories of the stones, but
The stories of all that has passed.
How the dragonflies dance in sunlight,
Each shadow a flash of eternity,
Their wings moving through a world
That folds and unfolds, like whispers in time."

I walk beside the river, entranced,
Awed by the flow that carries not
Just the memories of the stones, but
The stories of all that has passed.
How the dragonflies dance in sunlight,
Each shadow a flash of eternity,
Their wings moving through a world
That folds and unfolds, like whispers in time.
