The Shadow on the Stone
My heart was full of thoughts as bright
As could not snap, nor bring now—
That flit from shadow to living light,
Yet what is grown beneath it, I vow.

Night drowns her reign all engage;
Night wears its grasp on silver bones,
And conjured thoughts that gather a sage
Are lost between the vaults of stones.

The wails whisper hope in the unseen distance,
And the moon, the moon awaits in silence—
In that watch we are lost yet enduring—
All life beneath a shaded valiance!

- Thomas Hardy
