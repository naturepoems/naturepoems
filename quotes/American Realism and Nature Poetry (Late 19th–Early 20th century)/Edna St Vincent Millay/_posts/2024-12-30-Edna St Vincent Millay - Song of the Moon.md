I, being born a woman, and distressed
By all the burden of my womanhood,
In the short time that I have left to be,
Will give my nature no great reward.

What shall I do with this, my one short life?  
Shall I conceal it, and retreat in shame?
The moon will shine, the stars will sing,  
And I—will free my endless name.


- Edna St Vincent Millay
