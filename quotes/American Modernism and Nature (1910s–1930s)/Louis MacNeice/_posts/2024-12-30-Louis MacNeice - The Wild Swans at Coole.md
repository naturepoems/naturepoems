The Wild Swans at Coole

The trees are in their autumn beauty,  
The woodland paths are dry,  
Under the October twilight the water  
Mirrors a still sky;  
Upon the half-wet earth  
   They are often gone, but never alone.  
The wild swans are five,  
And I am their only companion.  

I have looked out my solitude  
As I await their return.  

I have written my word as to the event;  
But supremely have I  
Given them freedom.  
Let them come and go as they will,  
For beyond the human eye lies their  
Other kingdom,  
And their journeys has been all I could want  
Or mean or do  
In the past year.  

With the grace of their neat heads and their wings  
Is the flight from here to there,  
Yet I noted how frail they are,  
And the freeness I have given them  
Will also slip away from  
My hands like water,  
I cannot catch them again.

- Louis MacNeice
