Spring
Oh, joyful Spring! when life awakes,
And nature dons her garments bright;
The earth a smile for heaven makes,
As flowers burst, a pure delight.
The birds return, their song renewed,
The skies are clear, the sun aglow;
In every heart a hope imbued,
That life returns as rivers flow.

- Hartley Coleridge
