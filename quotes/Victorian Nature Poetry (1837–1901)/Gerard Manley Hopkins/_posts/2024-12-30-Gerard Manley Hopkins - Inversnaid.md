As kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame;  
As tumbled over rim in roundy wells  
Stones ring; like each tucked string tells,  
Each hung bell’s bow swung finds tongue to fling,  

What is past change;  
I say more: The just man justices;  
Kept equable, the devil’s fury unchecked,  
Lends every man a face;  

When the happy hour comes, to griefs that fall,  
In times of mystery, I fall in as well,  
The divine bring, to a verge, where sorrow said,  
‘There is the land and the fresh yield!  

Alive may be-well out there-  
All is grace and in return, as with song-bough crossed,  
Faith finds sweet closure;  

Only in this land is furnished a greener love;  
No better being cannot permitting it to fly.

  
What is past change—and the past we haunt  
Unlike the reed, in its grain, most ever free:  
That leans to wrong and knows not good,  

But I am borne again and I begin again:  
Ablaze, not long  
Lest the dark sweep of elements outrange me,  
With friends, that rising truth quenches all despair.

A kingfisher, a maiden;  
And like hermit reeds, flying stilled  
Across we list naked arms.


- Gerard Manley Hopkins
