Sunset dissolves
      the day's hard edges,
  a warmth settles,  
each hue deepening,
    the canvas spreading,
      life reflected.

  It knows in quiet  
    the end of brightness,  
  and we embrace the shadows,
    where day and night meet,  
    define their limits,
      the softening light.  

    Colors whisper,
  the edges turn to dream,
    each shape falls back,  
  allowing the night to rise.  

  All is understood;
    a place to breathe, 
    the beauty of it.

- George Oppen
