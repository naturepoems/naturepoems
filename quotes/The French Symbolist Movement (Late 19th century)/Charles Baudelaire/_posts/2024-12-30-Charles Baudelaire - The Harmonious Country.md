The Harmonious Country

But Nature, oh! where you lead, I shall march,
In circles frayed, on magic's surge embark,
I inhale the flowers burst anew,
And every soul there is ever true.

Among rolling fields, the scent of light,
With fallen sounds might drift to our delight,
And as you play, beyond sweet delight,
The heart rejoices in the shining night.


- Charles Baudelaire
