The brook sings on, and water falls,
As calm and deep as cadences
Of purest tones; yet echo calls,
And winds breathe lightly in the trees.

And there the sylvan shadows cling,
Close by the glades where silence lies:
The birds in happy chorus sing,
The bees hum round the flowered skies.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
