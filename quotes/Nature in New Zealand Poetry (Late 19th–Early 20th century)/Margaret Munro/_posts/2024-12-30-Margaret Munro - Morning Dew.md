Morning Dew

Upon the grass, the dew doth lie,  
Like diamonds kissed by morning's sigh,  
Each droplet holds a world within,  
A promise bright, a day to begin.

The flowers burst in colors bright,  
Awake to greet the golden light,  
In gentle warmth, the earth does stir,  
As nature's breath gives life to her.

Oh, morning dew, so pure and clear,  
In your embrace, I find my cheer,  
For in each drop, a dream resides,  
A fleeting moment time abides.

- Margaret Munro
