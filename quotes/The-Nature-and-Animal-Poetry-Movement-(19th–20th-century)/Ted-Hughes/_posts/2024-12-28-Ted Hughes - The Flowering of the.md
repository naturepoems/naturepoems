The Flowering of the Crone

    The old woman roams the fields of green,
    Gnarled branches trace her hands,
    The wildflower children kneel in silence,
    Their delicate faces turned towards sunshine.

    The crone beams as she strokes each petal,
    A delicate bloom of her own weaves to flesh,
    How the world transforms under her gentle touch,
    From barren soil springs a springing devotion.

    Flowers kissed by ghosts revive in a greening round,
    Each leaf a whisper of what could be,  
    She inspires life into shadows
    And shades reality across our throats.

    


- Ted Hughes
