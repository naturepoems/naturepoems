Disillusionment of Ten O'Clock

The houses are haunted
By white night-gowns.
None are green,
Except sorry and sorrowing.
No one is blue except the dreams.

And the people, they weave
And tremble and spin,
Through comfort of coming night.
And those who wear pajamas
Will know of  
What lies under the sky of the real.


- Wallace Stevens
