Crimson and gold spills into the grass, 
Winds tug at my heart, a whisper of change, 
As I watch the clouds roll above, 
Time drifts like the leaves caught in the current."

The broken fence where wildflowers grow, 
Crimson and gold spills into the grass, 
Winds tug at my heart, a whisper of change, 
As I watch the clouds roll above, 
Time drifts like the leaves caught in the current.
