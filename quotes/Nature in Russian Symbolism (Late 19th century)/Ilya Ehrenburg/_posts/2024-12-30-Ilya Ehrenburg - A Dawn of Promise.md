A Dawn of Promise
When dawn breaks through the sleepy haze,
A light cascades on dew-kissed ground;
Each ray a promise, bright display,
A brand new day, profound, unbound.

The world awakens, soft and clear,
In hues of gold, a new refrain;
With every heartbeat, life draws near,
And whispers hope through joy and pain.

- Ilya Ehrenburg
