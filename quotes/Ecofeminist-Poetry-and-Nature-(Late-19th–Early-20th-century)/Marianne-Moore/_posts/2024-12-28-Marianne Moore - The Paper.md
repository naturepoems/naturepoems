The Paper Nautilus

The lovely limited 
teleological body! The seas
by which it dwells are hot and their swell
is future’s strophe. Do not allow
deception under that soft-spoken hull,
or think of loveliness as mere ornament, 
or the true surface placed so, to obscure
what is indeterminate, yet making reason
by their beauty and the light of existence.
A virtue views a victory,
it effectively glances deeper.
The paper nautilus, suspended in vapor,
is here, wanting to be drawn by coincidence.
It remains an others’ being. 
We bury life in clay, it drifts in water. 



- Marianne Moore
