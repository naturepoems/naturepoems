Sonnet XXV,
   by Charlotte Smith

Like thoughts of many a stormy day,  
Yet gentle streams unbroken flow  
To darkened shores where tempests play,  
And bounteous hills with woods bestow,  
Upon the coast with silent glee  
The splendour of the wilds to see.  
Into the depths where shadows creep,  
The tender lures of ocean's sleep.

- Charlotte Smith
