The Evening Star
 
As twilight falls with softest grace,  
The evening star begins to glow,  
A tender light in vast embrace,  
Illuminating dreams below.  

In quiet moments, hearts unite,  
In nature’s canvas, shadows blend,  
With hope and whispers in the night,  
Where love and longing softly mend.

- Edward Burne-Jones
