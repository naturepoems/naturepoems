quote: "Through the seasons’ slow turning, I have seen
The transformations, the granules of dust,
Lifted and carried by a wandering wind.
The past remains—etched in the bark of trees,
And pressed into earth's fabric, each thread–
A story weathered, aged, washed clean,
Emerging anew under the gaze of dawn."

Through the seasons’ slow turning, I have seen
The transformations, the granules of dust,
Lifted and carried by a wandering wind.
The past remains—etched in the bark of trees,
And pressed into earth's fabric, each thread–
A story weathered, aged, washed clean,
Emerging anew under the gaze of dawn.
