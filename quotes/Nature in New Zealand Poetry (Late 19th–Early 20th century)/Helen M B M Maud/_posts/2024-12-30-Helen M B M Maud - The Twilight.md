The Twilight

When day retreats, and shadows yield,
The twilight drapes the world in sigh;
In gentle hues, the night revealed,
Where dreams are born and whispers fly.

A tranquil pause, a tender hour,
Where stars awaken, one by one;
In twilight’s glow, we find the power,
To lay our burdens down, undone.

So linger here, in dusky light,
In twilight’s grasp, let worries cease;
For in this space, where day meets night,
We find the truth of calm release.

- Helen M B M Maud
