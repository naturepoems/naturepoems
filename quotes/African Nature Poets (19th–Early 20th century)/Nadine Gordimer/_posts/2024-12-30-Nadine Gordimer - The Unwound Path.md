The road unwinds,
beneath a canopy of whispers,
reality blends into the echoes,
where the wild things are,
glimpses of what remains hidden
from the eyes of the unseeing.

Let us wander, draped in light,
or perhaps a shroud of dusk,
for every pang of regret
could be but a new beginning
in this terrestrial dance,
where life resounds like a riversong,
nuanced, graceful, intertwined.

This thread connects us all,
to the stars, the earth,
the laden trees, the falling rains,
into all melodies familiar and known,
where destiny finds its way.


- Nadine Gordimer
