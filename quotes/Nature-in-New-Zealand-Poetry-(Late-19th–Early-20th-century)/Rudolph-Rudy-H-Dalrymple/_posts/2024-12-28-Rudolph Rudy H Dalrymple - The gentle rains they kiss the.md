The gentle rains, they kiss the earth,
A soothing balm for weary ground,
As life awakens from its dearth,
In every drop, new hope is found.

From barren land to blooms so bright,
The cycle spins, the dance of fate,
In nature’s hands, the purest light,
Where every moment resonates.


- Rudolph Rudy H Dalrymple
