In twilight’s hours, the shadows play,
On fields where crickets serenade.
The fireflies blink, then fade away,
As night descends, the world’s cascade.

With gentle hand, the moon caress,
The earth below, a silvered gaze.
In nature’s hush, we find our rest,
Amidst the glow of evening’s haze.

- Marie de France
