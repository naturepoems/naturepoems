A Bird came down the Walk—  
He did not know I saw—  
He bit an Angleworm in halves  
And ate the fellow, raw.  

And then he drank a Dew  
From a convenient Grass—  
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall  
To let a Beetle pass—  

He glanced with rapid eyes  
That hurried all abroad—  
They looked like frightened Beads, I thought—  
He stirred his Velvet Head—  

Like one in danger, cautious,  
I wrung my hands—  
I could not see a bird—  
I only thought it was—  


- Emily Dickinson
