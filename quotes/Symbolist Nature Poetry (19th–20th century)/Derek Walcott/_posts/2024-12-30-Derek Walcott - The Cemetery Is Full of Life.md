The Cemetery Is Full of Life

They are buried,
     All ages,
In fields not unbroken by roots
Quaked by storms. Shouts
Drowned in the sky,
Ravenous as the wind,
When whole pools emerged
Like falling rain.
Their songs unselected in mists,
Beside white lilies that entwined
Until the summer poured in wide.

Look there, where
Gold finds green, where the damp slopes
Wavour the last seasons, teeming with time
And untamed fruits relinquished.
And above, a canopy spins

- Derek Walcott
