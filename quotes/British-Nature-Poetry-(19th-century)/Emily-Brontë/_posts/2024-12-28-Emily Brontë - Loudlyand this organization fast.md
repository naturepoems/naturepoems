Loudly—and this organization fast—  
I feel thy laughter echo in the vale!
For when the storm prevails off-times I bask—  
And midst the rustling leaves I set my sail.

My joy encircles trees, and roots are blessed,
From branches drops the dew, I hear it fall.
In each twig’s wisdom, harbored and confessed,  
The golden trees enthrall my mortal call.
 
In whispers soft, I capture nature wide,  
As torrents rush around me on the stones,
When I perceive how trees and heaven guide,  
With every dream I bear, I lose my bones.


- Emily Brontë
