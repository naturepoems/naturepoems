Daylight

Soon the dawn awakens
   as sounds wrap around,
   light cloaked in warmth,
    where sparrows converse.
A spirit stirs in green fields –
   to embrace, to turn light,
wide and distant.

In the glade, the ladder of day,
    each aspect breaking through,
       a slow weave of day,
just begun,
             woven as a guide, 
                    as blossom — 
  a breath of the still unfurling.

- Lorine Niedecker
