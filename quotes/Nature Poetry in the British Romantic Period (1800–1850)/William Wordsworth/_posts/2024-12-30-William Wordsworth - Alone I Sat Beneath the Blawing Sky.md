Alone I sat, beneath the blawing sky,
An even cloud, yet pure from earthly strife;
I heard no sound beside the skimbling sigh.
A calm that lulled in silence was my life.

Green grass did whisper thoughts in youth and ease,
The valley was the place where man can rest;
My spirits flew as high as that high trees,
A wealthy mind, where all was at its best.

- William Wordsworth
