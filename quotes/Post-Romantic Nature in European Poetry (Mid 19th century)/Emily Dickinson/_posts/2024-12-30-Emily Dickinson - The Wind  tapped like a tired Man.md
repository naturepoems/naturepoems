The Wind — tapped like a tired Man  
And like a Host, came in –  
And like a Friend resided there  
And then he went again –  

The Grass, gallant to his Feet,  
Stood straight and tall, and proud –  
But dropping like an Honor Guard  
When the Hurrah was loud –  

A gentle touch, the branches swayed  
With every whispering sigh —  
The Earth rejoiced to feel his breath  
As he traveled through my mind –

- Emily Dickinson
