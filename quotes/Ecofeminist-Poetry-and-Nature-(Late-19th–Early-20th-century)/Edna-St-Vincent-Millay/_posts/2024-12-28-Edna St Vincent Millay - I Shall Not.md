I Shall Not Care

When I am dead, my dearest,
Send no sad, shrouded chapels,
Flocks of silly mourners' tears
Not a wish to keep my hapless; 
But wear the light of laughter’s flight,
Let them smile in sweet endeavor,
And touch the flowers lightly cited,
For I shall not care forever.

Let the stars down fall above me,
Let the daffodils grow free,
For I shall not care beneath them,
Beneath, there shall be no me.
