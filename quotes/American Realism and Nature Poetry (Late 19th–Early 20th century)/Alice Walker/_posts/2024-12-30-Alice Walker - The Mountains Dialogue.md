Mountains breathe,
mighty witnesses to decay and rebirth,
as clouds wrap their heads,
like stories untold.

They speak in thunder,
and we listen,
feeling small,
yet intertwined,
dancing souls on the earth,
where every blade of grass
whispers of yearning.

In their shadow, I find strength,
a call to honor the land,
a reminder of permanence,
every crag, every peak,
a chapter in our dialogue
with the world around us.

- Alice Walker
