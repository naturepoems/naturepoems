In the blooming fields of spring,  
beneath the sunâ€™s embracing glow,  
we hear the silent songs they sing,  
a chorus only blossoms know.
\nEach petal soft, each hue a brush,  
a canvas rich in life portrayed;  
where time stands still, and thoughts can hush,  
the beauty here shall never fade.

- John Dewey
