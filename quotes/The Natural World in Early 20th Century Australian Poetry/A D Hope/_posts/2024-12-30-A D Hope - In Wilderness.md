In Wilderness
Among the rocks and sandy shores,  
Where wild things roam and waters sigh,  
The wilderness continuously soars,  
In awe we question why we fly.

The ancient trees, they watch and know,  
Their roots spread deep, entwined with fate,  
Through time and age, both fast and slow,  
They witness moments we create.

Ode to the wild, the calm, the true,  
Where life finds space to breathe and grow,  
In realms of nature, bold and new,  
Our spirits soar, our passions flow.
