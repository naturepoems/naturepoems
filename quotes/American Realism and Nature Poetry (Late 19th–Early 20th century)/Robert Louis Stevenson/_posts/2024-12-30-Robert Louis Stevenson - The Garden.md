The Garden
As I sat on the kitchen floor  
       And drew my long, long breath,  
I thought of all the joy and grief  
       That made my little death.

I saw the roses falling,  
       And the wall looked blue;  
The bird sang low  
       And the skies were also blue.

The world was full of wonder,  
       And full of joy;  
Yet as I think  
       Of you, I blow the skies away.




- Robert Louis Stevenson
