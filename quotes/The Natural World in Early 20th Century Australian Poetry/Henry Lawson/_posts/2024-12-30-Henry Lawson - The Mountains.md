The Mountains

The mountains I have seen
Stand grandly in the night,
In silence, proud and serene,
Bathed in the silver light.

The rivers dive and soar,
The valleys rise and fall,
And nature's song once more
Is heard around us all.

So let me walk the hills,
With winds that sweep the plains,
Where each sweet whisper thrills,
And every heart attains.

The mountains rise before me,
In twilight's soft embrace,
Reminding me their glory
Is Nature's saving grace.

- Henry Lawson
