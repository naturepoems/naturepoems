IN THE WILDERNESS

The wild wind sings a wandering song,
Through the trees, it flits and weaves.
And I feel as if I too belong,
Underneath the falling leaves.

The woodland’s voice, I hear it call,
As branches sway above.
A gentle pulse, like nature’s thrall,
Whispers soft the word of love.


- Edna Saint Vincent Millay
