a yard full of cards left unplayed, 
each one a moment lost in fog, 
aeons hum and harken while the world spins,
harvest trembles under a pensive sky."

Autumn arrives like a frail bird, 
a yard full of cards left unplayed, 
each one a moment lost in fog, 
aeons hum and harken while the world spins,
harvest trembles under a pensive sky.

- Marianne Moore
