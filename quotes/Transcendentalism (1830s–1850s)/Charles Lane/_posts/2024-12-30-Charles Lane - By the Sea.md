Oh, to wander by the sea,
Where waves embrace the shores so free,
The salty air, the gulls that soar,
Where heart and ocean sing, restore.

Each tide that ebbs, each wave that flows,
A rhythm of life that ever glows,
In nature’s pulse, we find our way,
In ocean’s breath, we learn to stay.

- Charles Lane
