I wander through the meadows,
Where daisies and forget-me-nots,
Paint the ground in hues of innocence,
As the butterfly flutters,
A dancer in the golden light.

The sky leaves its mirror,
On the surface of the brook,
And laughter echoes,
Amongst the beckoning hills,
In harmony with my heart's rhythm.

- Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
