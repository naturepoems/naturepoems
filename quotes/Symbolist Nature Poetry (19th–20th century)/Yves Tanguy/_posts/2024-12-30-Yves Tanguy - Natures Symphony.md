The whisper of leaves sung in the breeze,  
Telling stories of the days gone by,  
Of life’s sweet dance under the trees,  
Where earth and sky entwine and sigh.

A symphony crafted in nature's hand,  
With every step, the heartbeat flows,  
In every rustle, in every strand,  
The essence of time in beauty grows.


- Yves Tanguy
