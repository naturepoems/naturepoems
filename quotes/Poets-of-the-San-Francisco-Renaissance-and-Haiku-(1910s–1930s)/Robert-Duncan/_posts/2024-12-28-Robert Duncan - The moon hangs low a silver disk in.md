author: Robert Duncan
quote: "The moon hangs low, a silver disk in the sky,
Casting soft shadows over the gentle waves,
Kissing the earth with an ethereal glow.
A nightingale sings of lost dreams in the stillness,
While stars dance like fireflies, elusive and free,
Each twinkle a pause in the heart of the night."

The moon hangs low, a silver disk in the sky,
Casting soft shadows over the gentle waves,
Kissing the earth with an ethereal glow.
A nightingale sings of lost dreams in the stillness,
While stars dance like fireflies, elusive and free,
Each twinkle a pause in the heart of the night.
