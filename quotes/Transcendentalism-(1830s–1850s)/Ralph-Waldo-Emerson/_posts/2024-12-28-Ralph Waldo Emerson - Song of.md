Song of Nature

   A slender tree, on which
   The wild rose blooms; so small,
   So shy; its whispers purer yet,
   Seems a tree to call.

   And the brook runs softly by,
   To mingle with its dew,
   Life may seem absurd and shy,
   But it swells in murmur true.

                                                          —Ralph Waldo Emerson
