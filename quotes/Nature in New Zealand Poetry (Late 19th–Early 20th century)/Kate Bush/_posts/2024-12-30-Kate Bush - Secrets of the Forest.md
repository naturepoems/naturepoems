In the heart of the forest, time is lost,
a dance of shadows, a play of light.

Old trees stand as sentinels, solemn and wise,
rooted in the fabric of silent memories.

Moss carpets the earth, soft underfoot,
a reminder of nature’s gentle touch.

Listen to the murmurs among the branches,
a whisper of secrets held close by the woods.

- Kate Bush
