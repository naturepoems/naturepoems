The Butterfly

In the daytime thistle  
numbered the flowers  
shunned by the flying butterfly;  
no sound points them out  
under the angular blue  
of night, with closed wings.  

A dozen of futures  
substituted in the labyrinth  
of dreams and fancies,  
among a velvet shadow,  
freed breaking,  
our skin the random kernel.  

Yonder lives the shade,  
yonder lights abide.  
Toward blue lamps I send  
now the return of my heart.  
I sang of flowers,  
i sang of ghosts.  

Butterfly! Please visit me  
as near as in absence  
of the delicate pulse of my future.  
Fly lightly!

- Gabriela Mistral
