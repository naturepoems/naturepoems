Birches
When I see birches bend to left and right
Across the line of straighter darker trees,
I like to think some boy's been swinging them.
But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay
As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
After a rain. They squarely get there backs
When they've fallen down. I would rather see
The birches bend to the boy swinging them.

But I must go in, and I must leave them swinging,
Never to return, and I had to go
And let them fall under the heavy storm.
When the boy swings the birches back again,
Somewhere I learned, 'You have to fall before you rise,'
And on the last line of break came a shiver
Of joy and of the sunlight.


- Robert Frost
