If I could live my life
As a soft stream flows,
With purpose, ever gentle,
Yet strong where it goes,
I would entwine my being
With natureâ€™s gentle roots,
And in a world of flowers,
Embrace their gentle shoots.
For every petal whispers
Of love beyond the crowd,
In forests full of mysteries,
And all that earth allows.
Dancing through the shadows,
I would wander as I please,
In unity with nature,
In harmony with trees.


- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
