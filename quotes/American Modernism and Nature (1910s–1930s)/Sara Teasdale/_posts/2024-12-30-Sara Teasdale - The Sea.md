Ah, when the night falls
and the world begins to rest,
I recall the shimmer of surf,
the indigo and gray of the sea.

The moon casts a silvery glow,
a beacon to the lost and weary,
a glance that tugs at core feelings,
yet comforts in endless cycles.

Each wave a whisper,
each ripple a promise kept,
a connection through the night,
where stars dance on water’s mirror.

- Sara Teasdale
