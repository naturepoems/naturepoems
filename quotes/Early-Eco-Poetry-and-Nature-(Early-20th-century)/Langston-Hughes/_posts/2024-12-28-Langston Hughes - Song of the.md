Song of the Trees

The little trees—
They dance when the wind blows,
Swinging and swaying,
In the pure spring air.

The black trees stand guard,
   Silent,
   Still,
   With their towering limbs,
Listen to the whispering grass,
   Shivering under the starry night.

A flower falls softly, the dance of the trees,
Hear their laughter echo,
In nature’s sweet embrace.

Together we create the heart of the earth,
   Singing, breathing,
Till the day is done.

- Langston Hughes
