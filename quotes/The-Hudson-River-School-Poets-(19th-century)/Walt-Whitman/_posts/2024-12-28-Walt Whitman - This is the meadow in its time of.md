This is the meadow, in its time of bloom,
Where the colors blend and the senses meet,
Where the daisies dance with the breeze,
And the lilacs whisper sweet.

With the gentle rustle of leaves,
And the soft hum of bees at play,
So joyous is the heart to rest,
In this patch where beauty holds sway.

Nature’s serenade calls out to me,
Her laughter in streams, her tears in the rain,
As I step inside her graceful arms,
I know that I will never be the same.

— From "Leaves of Grass"

- Walt Whitman
