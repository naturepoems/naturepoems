The Idea of Order at Key West

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind
Of man or its control, but was a slew
Of disarray reduced from sense.
And I, who had on that other shore,
Returned, Motived, inspired.

As she sang, we floated on the waters,  
The wild sound of her song appealed
Beyond the waves in harmony unlocked.
In the sound beyond direct capture;  
Key West thus, become aligned with outward lines,  
Order from him as soft approaches,  
Shaped by abstraction, whittled away at  
Dissonance.

Her theme held sway; my heart did become.  
And each dismayed reflection, led full.
In each tone, the gentle distance reached,  
Obscribed flows adorned indifference moments,  
The weather, elusive, honest, and cool,  
Ran with her song and echoed her rashness.

- Wallace Stevens
