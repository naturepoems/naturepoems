Mid-Summer

                The sun lies low on the grass tonight,
                With stars that twinkle, bold and bright.
                The evening swells with scents anew,
                As shadows lay, and night ensues.
                
                Faint songs, like echoes in the trees,
                Are carried soft by gentle breeze.
                The flowers mingle, cool their dress,
                Embracing scents that weave the rest.
                
                Great dance of shadows â€˜neath the moon,
                We cherish still this sweet perfume.
                In every petal, thrill the earth,
                O let us kindle love and mirth.

- Ivor Gurney
