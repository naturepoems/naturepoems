Here lies the heart of the forest,
Wrapped in emerald blankets,
Each tree a sentinel of stories,
Every trunk a chapter of lore.

Among wildflowers and whispers,
I wade through the ink of silence,
In the serene embrace of the dusk,
Where shadows twirl and dance,
With the joy of a thousand memories.

- Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
