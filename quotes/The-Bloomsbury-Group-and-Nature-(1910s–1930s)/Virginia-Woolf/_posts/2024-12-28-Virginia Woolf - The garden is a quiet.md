The garden is a quiet place,
  Where colors bloom and fade,
  Each petal tells a tale of joy
  As fragrances float on gentle breeze.
  I feel the pulse of hidden life,
  Beneath the soil, in roots entwined,
  And at my feet, the soft green grass,
  Cradles whispers of earth's embrace.

  - from "Garden Whispers" (1921)
