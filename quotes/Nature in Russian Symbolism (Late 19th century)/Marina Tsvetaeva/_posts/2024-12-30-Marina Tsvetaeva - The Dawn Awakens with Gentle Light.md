The dawn awakes with gentle light,
Caressing leaves that tremble slow,
Each hue, a promise of the day,
In nature’s arms, we’ll bloom and grow.
The morning dew upon the grass,
Like diamonds strewn across the vale,
In these moments, sacred, still,
The universe begins to sail.
And as the birds proclaim their joy,
A symphony so sweet and bright,
My heart entwines with nature’s pulse,
In the embrace of morning light.

- Marina Tsvetaeva
