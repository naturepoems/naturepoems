In spring’s tender bloom, the world comes alive,
A symphony of colors where dreams can thrive.
Cherry blossoms dance in the softest breeze,
A fleeting reminder of nature’s sweet tease.

Honeybees hum as they gather their feast,
In nature’s banquet, all creatures released.
The fragrance of flowers fills the air sweet,
In the garden of life, my heart finds its beat.
