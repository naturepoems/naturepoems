The Dawn

Awake, my heart,
As the world stirs from slumber,
The dawn wraps the earth in gold,
A new beginning unfolds before us.

The sun rises gently,
Painting the skies with hope,
And the winds carry the promise,
Of another day to cherish.

In this moment of awakening,
Nature sings a symphony of joy,
And I am filled with the light,
Of the infinite possibilities ahead.

â€” Pablo Neruda
