The Rain
Where she stood, it fell
Against glassâ€”pines, mighty teeter
Curl shadow feathered weather
Light from the bright.

Slow like silver,
Slivers of our lust,
In minor swell, it dreams,
Caught by finger fumble,
Huffing smokes of scents as rain,
Drains the joys of birth; glistened.

- Ted Hughes
