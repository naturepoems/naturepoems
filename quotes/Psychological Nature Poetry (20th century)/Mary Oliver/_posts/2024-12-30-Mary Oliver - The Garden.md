The Garden

Here is the garden; I share it with my mother,
with children who dance in the sunlight
and run up through the tall grass
with laughter ringing often as volatile shadows
ingrain the night.
There is joy here, at once ephemeral
and full of breath, and I tend to every bloom to make
the future a better place.
Budded hopes shooting free to the edges
of the seeds I scattered before.
And here too is the soft, cool passing
of evening light, a breath I can feel,
as we sit together, holding the moments close,
for the garden to grow,
to see these petals ease into day.
Oh, mother, I share it with you, what ground we
copied, what flowers weâ€™ve grown this time,
and I believe it still: the trees have roots
that may touch the stars at night!

- Mary Oliver
