The Blessed Damozel

The blessed damozel leaned out
    From the gold bar of Heaven;
    Her eyes were deeper than the sea,
    And as a sea-bird's call, she serenely
    Indicated, as with her finger on its leaky breast,
    The hands of the faithful who were left to does all the tasks.

Her golden hair streamed down; she held
    The green serpent of the months,
    The little scarlet bird that twinkles in the night
    And lingers on the throaty lusts;
    The light of her presence examined the sky
    To greet the engrafted morning's kiss.

O endless wonder! have we not
    A secret power over our disked love?
    In heaven shall we comb the hair of grass:
    Plug the story of the earth with sighs and wiles;
    Shall we rejoice in a feathery light?

But the damozel smiled dimly to behold
    Those golden feathers planted upon the sun,
    Breathed a thin breath, and lent her wings
    Back to whence she fluttered; without a sound,
    Sunset stared her gracefully knowing,
    While the sun looked round like a father or friend.


- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
