The morning dew upon the grass,
A glimmering pearl, as time does pass,
Each blade a world, so small, so grand,
A touch of nature’s gentle hand.

With every dawn, new life appears,
The chirp of crickets, songs of cheers,
In nature’s choir, we find our place,
In every leaf, in every face.

- Charles Lane
