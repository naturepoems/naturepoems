Under the Sky
The vastness of the sky above,
A reminder of the Creator’s love,
With clouds that drift and stars that gleam,
In nature’s beauty, we find our dream.

With every glance, a world unfolds,
In shades of blue, in stories told,
Under this vast, eternal dome,
I find in the sky, my heart’s true home.


- Ruth H M Houghton
