Beyond the Horizon
What lies beyond the horizon
is a question pondered endlessly,
a realm painted in anticipation,
a lure of adventure calling.

Each sunset bleeds into the unknown,
one part mystery, one part promise;
the sky opens to dreams,
a canvas of electric colors
beckoning us to explore,
to venture where the wild things grow.


- Francis Picabia
