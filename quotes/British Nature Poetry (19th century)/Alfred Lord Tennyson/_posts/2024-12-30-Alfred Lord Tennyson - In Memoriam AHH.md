In Memoriam A.H.H.

I hold it true, whate'er befall;
   I feel it, when I sorrow most;
'Tis better to have loved and lost
   Than never to have loved at all.

In Memoriam A.H.H. 7

O friends, with whom my heart hath dwelt,
   To you I turn with the wishful prayer,
That when the final farewell is dealt,
   There may be a leaf of summer air.

In Memoriam A.H.H. 29

Warm summer sun, shine kindly here,
   Warm Southern wind, blow sweetly here;
   Green sod above, light air below,
   Last resting place, for thee, we know.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
