Beneath the Boughs

Beneath the boughs in a shaded glade,
Where whispers form in the dance of dreams;
I linger soft while the sun does fade,
And thoughts of night weave through moonlit beams.

The breeze rustles leaves with a tender sigh;
And shadows waltz with the twilight glow;
While the world fades out with the day gone by,
A stillness reigns in the soft winds' flow.

Here nature holds her sacred space,
With stories learned from ages long;
In every hide and every place,
Resides a beauty, wild and strong.

- Wilfrid Wilson Gibson
