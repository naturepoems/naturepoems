Beneath the Stars  
In the quiet of night,  
where shadows take form,  
below the vast heavens,  
a world to transform.  
Stars dance like fireflies  
in celestial play,  
each twinkle a promise  
of another day.  
Embrace the stillness,  
the beauty up high, 
in the heart of the night,  
astoundingly nigh.

- Carl Robert Jakobson
