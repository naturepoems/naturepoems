To stroll beside the misty shores,
  Where shadows dance on twilight’s edge,
  The whispers of the wind implore,
  To scatter tales along the hedge.

For nature speaks in quiet tones,
  Beneath the boughs where soft winds play,
  A symphony of gnarled old stones,
  That keep our secrets through the day.

- Isaak Walton
