Sunrise Over the Field

An amber glow seeps through the horizon,
Beneath the blanket of night, hope awakens,
Fields stretch and yawn, kissed by the dawn,
Where dreams graze in the light of new beginnings.

The dew clings lovingly to the grass,
Each blade a prism, holding morning’s light,
As the sun rises like a heartbeat,
Banishing shadows to the edges of the day.

Nature holds its breath in anticipation,
As the world erupts in color and sound,
This miracle chases doubt away,
In the embrace of a sunlit field, I’m found.
