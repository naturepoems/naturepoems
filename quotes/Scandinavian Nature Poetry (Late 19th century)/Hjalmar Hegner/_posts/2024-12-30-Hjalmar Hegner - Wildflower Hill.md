Upon the hill where wildflowers grow,  
With petals bright, in colors bold,  
The breezes hum, the soft winds blow,  
A story of the earth retold.

Here time stands still; the sun drapes gold,  
Upon each blade and fluttering wing,  
In natureâ€™s arms, I feel so whole,  
As life and beauty softly sing.

- Hjalmar Hegner
