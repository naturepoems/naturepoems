In Praise of Flowers

What states, abandoned even of bloom,
  Doth leap and sigh beneath my tread?
Where only among silent silence loom,
  Those that quicken hearts and once fed.

   Oâ€™ would that I could stay in sight,
   A glow upon the rose's breath,
For all must blossom forth in right,
  And drown in joy, not death.

- Ben Jonson
