A Summer Night

The night is calm, the moonlight streams
Through foliage thick, like pale fair dreams;
As over fields and woodlands bright,
The warring shadow lifts its night.

Above the hills, the stars that twinkle
Above us, with all their labor, sprinkle
Rustling wheels amongst the trees;
In every sound, in every breeze,

Listen! the crickets chirp and sing,
And soft along the melodyâ€™s spring
The heavens watch, the soft shade falls
As whispers float through leafy halls.

A summer night! Our silence speaks,
And soul in quiet sings and seeks.
O rapture pure, thy peace wide lost!
To grasp this life, or fade, be tossed.

- Matthew Arnold
