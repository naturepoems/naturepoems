A soft blanket, shrouding the world,
Each step a whisper, a fleeting shape,
Blurring the edges of familiar paths,
Inviting reflection in the quiet stillness."

The Fog
A soft blanket, shrouding the world,
Each step a whisper, a fleeting shape,
Blurring the edges of familiar paths,
Inviting reflection in the quiet stillness.

- Francis Ponge
