Through valleys shrouded with a hue,
   Where shadows chase the fleeting light,
   I wander paths of emerald green,
   As nature’s breath takes wing in flight.

   The flowers dance on painted hills,
   Each color sparks a quiet thought,
   And thoughts flow free like streams that spill,
   Like ancient tales that life has wrought.

   The sky, a canvas of the bold,
   Paints dreams upon the endless sea,
   And in its depths the heart unfolds,
   To share with life its mystery.

- T E Lawrence
