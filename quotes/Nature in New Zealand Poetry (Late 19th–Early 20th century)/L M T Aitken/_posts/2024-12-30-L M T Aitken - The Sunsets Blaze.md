The sunsets blaze in crimson hue,
   As twilight falls upon the glade;
The stars awaken, bright and true,
   Beneath the evening's cool cascade.

The nightingale with silver song,
   Fills quiet woods with melodies;
In nature's realm, where hearts belong,
   We find our peace beneath the trees.


- L M T Aitken
