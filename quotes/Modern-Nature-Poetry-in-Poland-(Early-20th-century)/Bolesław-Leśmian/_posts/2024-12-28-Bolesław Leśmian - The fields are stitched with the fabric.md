The fields are stitched with the fabric of night,
A quilt sewn of shadows and dreams serene,
Where the crickets awaken and sing their delight,
In a symphony born in the quiet unseen.

Gentle breezes wander, caressing the trees,
Those guardians of whispers and stories untold,
While the stars peer down, like old friends at ease,
As the moon keeps watch, glowing silver and bold.


- Bolesław Leśmian
