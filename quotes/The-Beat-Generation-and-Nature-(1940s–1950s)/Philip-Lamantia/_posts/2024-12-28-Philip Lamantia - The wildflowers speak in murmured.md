The wildflowers speak in murmured tones,
Among broken boughs and ancient stones,
Flashing colors that ignite the day,
With the essence of life in disarray.

Sun spills down in a golden field,
Each petal’s story yearning to be revealed.
A symphony plays in the swaying trees,
Nature’s heartbeat is the song of the breeze.
