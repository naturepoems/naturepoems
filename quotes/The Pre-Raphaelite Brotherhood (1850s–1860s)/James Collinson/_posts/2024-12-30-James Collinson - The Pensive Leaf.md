The Pensive Leaf


  As long as the waves on the winter,  
  How cold doth it seem here, remind  
  All shades with me seem splintered —  
  In day softly purged with lips aligned;  
  A thought broods down softer with night  
  Whispering down from its towers fair;  
  Adhere as pains burst forth in flight  
  In the hearts that are sweet through the air.
