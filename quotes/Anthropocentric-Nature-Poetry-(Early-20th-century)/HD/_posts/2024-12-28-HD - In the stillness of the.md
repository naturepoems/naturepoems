In the stillness of the dawn,
a brook hums a tune,
a lullaby for the waking woods.

Trees stretch their limbs
in the light, embracing each
ray as a lover's kiss.

Animal calls reverberate,
especially their quivery light
that dances with the sun's glow.

Nature sings in a quiet voice,
reminding us of our place,
in this woven tapestry of existence.
