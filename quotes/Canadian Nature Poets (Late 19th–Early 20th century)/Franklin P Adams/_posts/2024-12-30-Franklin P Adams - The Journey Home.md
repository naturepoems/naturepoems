The Journey Home

As rivers flow and mountains rise,
We seek our way beneath the skies,
In Nature’s arms, where hearts can roam,
We find the path that leads us home.

With every star and whispering tree,
In Nature’s love, we learn to be,
The journey long, but oh so sweet,
In every footstep, life’s heartbeat.


- Franklin P Adams
