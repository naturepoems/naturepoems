The Flower's Name  
But I do not mean to be  
More than I am: I will not try  
To breed a name of shame for me  
While on its leaves the hues outcry  
In soft submission—who am I?  

A flower without a name,  
It must be fame's vanity—  
A patch of beauty's broken tame,  
Where all is spent—where I must plea  
And fade away inevitably.

- Robert Browning
