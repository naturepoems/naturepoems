The flowers bloom with colors bright,
Their fragrance fills the summer air;
In every petal, pure delight,
An offering beyond compare.

The buzzing bees with golden hue,
Do dance from bloom to bloom and sing,
While nature’s symphony rings true,
In every breath, the joy we bring.

Oh, let us heed this fleeting hour,
And walk among the blossoms sweet;
For in this life, we find the power,
To cherish each and every beat.

- Hannah More
