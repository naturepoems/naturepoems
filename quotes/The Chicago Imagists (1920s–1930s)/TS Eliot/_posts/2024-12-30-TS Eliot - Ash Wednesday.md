Ash Wednesday

Because I cannot wait
To go back again and sit
For eternity in the learning
Of trees that drink the sun;
I find myself at ease
With the rustling leaves
And whispering air.

And in that moment
I yield entirely to the simple beauty
Of the light that plays
Upon the blades of grass.

In the garden I see
The flowers dance
And birds sing in tandem…
In the shed of warmth,
Floral fragrances embraced in the summer.

Oh how I live for the bloom of spring,
To feel the smiling sun's embrace18
Upon my spine!

- TS Eliot
