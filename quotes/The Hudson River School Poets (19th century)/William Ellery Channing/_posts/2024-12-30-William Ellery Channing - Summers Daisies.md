The daisies bloom in summer’s song,  
A chorus of the earth’s embrace,  
Bringing joy to hearts that long,  
For peace, for love, and for grace.  

Each petal whispers, soft and clear,  
Of moments pass, but memories stay,  
In gardens where the heart draws near,  
Nature’s gifts, forever sway.

- William Ellery Channing
