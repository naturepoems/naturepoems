Seek not in the creature with two legs,
For the truest teacher is tree and stream.
Nature's hand stretches out like a friend,
Imparting the peace beyond the dream.

Listen—each petal whispers a truth,
Every breeze carries hints of life’s art,
The stars are the poets of infinite wisdom,
The crickets play tunes straight from the heart.

In the night’s tender graces, we gather,
Wrapped in the calm of the moon’s soft light;
Join in the circle, partake of the song,
For the heart of the world beats through the night.
— Margaret Fuller
