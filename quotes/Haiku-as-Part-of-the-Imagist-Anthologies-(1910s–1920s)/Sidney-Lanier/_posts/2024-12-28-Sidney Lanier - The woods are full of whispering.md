quote: "The woods are full of whispering leaves,  
And the river runs bright with the tears of the sky.  
In the quiet afternoon light,  
Nature's heartbeat echoes deep and dry."

The woods are full of whispering leaves,  
And the river runs bright with the tears of the sky.  
In the quiet afternoon light,  
Nature's heartbeat echoes deep and dry.
