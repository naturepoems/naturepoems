The Sky

The light of a great sky
sinks into my sadness. 
How slowly, yet surely it pours, 
it drips like a beloved song.
Falling on petals of evening,
it lingers where sunlight dwells.
All things shine with vividness,
even the shadows stretched, 
touching me softly,
unexpected. 

Only the great blue heavens, 
selflessly sink and age, 
every star within a rapture of the moments,
that swiftly flows star by star.
The night is patient; it waits,
for every dreamerâ€™s heart. 



- Rainer Maria Rilke
