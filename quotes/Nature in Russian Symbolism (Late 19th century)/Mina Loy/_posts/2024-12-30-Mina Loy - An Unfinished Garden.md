An Unfinished Garden
An unkempt garden
clad in heavy vines grows old,
the scent clings less to light;
each crevice moves upon the sun
as bright and storm-blown who chooses;
only silent wading blooms aglow,
his fingers grasp at every streak,
replace winks, it streams softly —
a reminiscence for what once adorned,
you trembled carved with esteem —
a garden where leaves drift down at dusk,
breath rest in light, emerald-green.

- Mina Loy
