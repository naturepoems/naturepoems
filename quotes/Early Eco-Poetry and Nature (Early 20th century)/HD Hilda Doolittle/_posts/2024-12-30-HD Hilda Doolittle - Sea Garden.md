The sea is a soft bed
with a thick, thick covering  
of drifted sea-moss,
where the tender green  
of the cool sea-plant,
is softly   
fringed with floating  
eve,  
as it one sea-rose is frail. 
The long weary chains  
offold time  
repose in the mirrors
of silver sand,  
and gray of water  
is fading, fading.
In long light, with  
weary seas that ease  
from the blue day.
 
She shall not sleep, nor dwell  
under cool, cool star,  
for the wildness heard,  
can hear the far booms  
from the quiet face  
of the incomparable sea.

- HD Hilda Doolittle
