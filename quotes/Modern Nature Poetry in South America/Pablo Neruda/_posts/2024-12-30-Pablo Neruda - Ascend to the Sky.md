Upon the mountain’s peak,
I find my spirit soaring,
a refuge among the clouds,
a bond with the cosmos eternal.
Here, the world unfolds,
a panorama of jade and gold,
each hue a promise,
each breath a statement of being.

In this solitude, I am whole,
where the air sings through pines,
a symphony of ancient whispers,
a conversation with the winds.
I am kissed by nature’s grace,
my heart dances with stars,
a seamless connection forged,
a testament to life in all its forms.

- Pablo Neruda
