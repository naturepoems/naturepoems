quote: "Trees keep their secrets,  
in the sound of the wind  
often a shifting of leaves  
whispering a song for peace.  
it is here we listen,  
feel the breath dissolve,  
a communion of quiet,  
the unbroken thread of time."

Trees keep their secrets,  
in the sound of the wind  
often a shifting of leaves  
whispering a song for peace.  
it is here we listen,  
feel the breath dissolve,  
a communion of quiet,  
the unbroken thread of time.
