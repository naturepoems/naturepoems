The Open Field

An open field where wildflowers bloom,
Their colors a dance in the morning light,
Where the earth is painted without fear or gloom,
And nature holds no boundaries in sight.

I stroll among daisies, sunflowers tall,
Each petal a brushstroke on canvas divine,
The fragrance of earth sings a sweet call,
Inviting me deeper to natureâ€™s design.

Under the wide expanse of blue sky,
I let my spirit soar and roam, 
In the open field where worries can fly,
I find my heart is forever at home.

- John Burroughs
