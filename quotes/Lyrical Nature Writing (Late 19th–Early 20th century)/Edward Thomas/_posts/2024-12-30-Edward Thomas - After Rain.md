After Rain

After rain, the world is fresh and bright,
The earth, a canvas, pristine and clear,
Each blade of grass in vivid light,
A hymn of nature that we hear.

A puddle reflects the sky’s embrace,
As birthed anew, in drops of joy,
In every corner, a gentle trace,
Of life reborn, as the storms coy.


- Edward Thomas
