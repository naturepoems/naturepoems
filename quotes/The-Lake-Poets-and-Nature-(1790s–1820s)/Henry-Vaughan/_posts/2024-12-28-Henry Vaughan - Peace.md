Peace
There is in soul a compass—let us lay
Our ears to nature’s miracles and stay
Amid the woods a-swinging to the breath
Of innocent winds—hey! who would call it death!
Midst shadows which the trembling branches spread;
In ivy'd nooks and wounds, and vale-stilts laid
In plough's deep furrows and green-circled vines
O'er broad hills shooting forth their sad designs?
There comes the little poet to her blue, 
And ends his vision, softly swept anew!

Let us not waste a tender hour in time,
But gather in the youth of every chime!
And hope so frail, that wheresoe’er it flies,
Crouch over all its struggling syllables—rise!

- Henry Vaughan
