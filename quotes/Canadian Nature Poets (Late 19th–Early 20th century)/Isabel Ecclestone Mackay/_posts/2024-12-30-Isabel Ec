A race of men, I see them go,  
In the country where the wild things grow;  
They gather near the farthest shore,  
And, with all their hearts, they sing once more,  
Songs of the woods, and of the streams,  
Songs of the flowers, and of their dreams.  
They lift their eyes to the skies above,  
And lo! The beauty that comes from love—  
Love of the free, the wild, the bold,  
The country where the dreams unfold.

**To the Pine**  

Through light and shade, through storm and sun,  
Thou standest there, a sentinel lone,  
To guard our paths, and greet the day;  
With arms outspread to guide the way.  
In the wild fields, where the wild winds blow,  
Thy needles gather diamonds of the snow,  
Oh, may thy shade, from the summer’s heat,  
Be a refuge to the wanderer’s feet.

**The Singing Leaves**  

Leaves that flutter in the breeze,  
Whisper softly to the trees;  
Tell of sunshine, tell of rain,  
Tell of joy, and tell of pain.  
When the twilight gathers slow,  
Then, with every sigh, they flow;  
And the pulses of the night  
Beat with life and life’s delight.

**The Garden of the Wild**  

In the garden of the wild,  
Where the sunbeams dance around,  
Every flower a dream beguiled,  
Every leaf a solemn sound;  
From the shadows, softly creeping,  
Whispers of the winds are sweeping,  
Life and love and all that’s fair,  
In the garden of the wild, we share.  

---

**The Stream**  

The stream that winds through wood and glen,  
Is like the hopes of youth again;  
With laughter in its bubbling flow,  
And whispers of the vale below.  
It winds away from care and pain,  
To meet the ocean wide and plain.  
Oh, may it ever sing for me!  
The song of youth, the song of free!

**Ave Maria**  

Through the stillness of the night,  
Come the stars with gentle light;  
Whisper secrets to the moon,  
In the midnight's soft cocoon.  
Nature holds her breath and waits,  
For the touch of heaven’s gates;  
And the hush upon the earth  
Is a promise of new birth.

**The Mountain’s Heart**  

Upon the mountain, proud and high,  
A heart is beating toward the sky;  
In silence, wrapped in dreams so vast,  
It tells of ages spent and past.  
With every peak, and every vale,  
There’s a story in the gale;  
And the stars, in their bright throng,  
Sing the mountains’ ancient song.  

---

**The Elm Tree**  

The elm, so grand, in strength and might,  
Stands watchful, through the day and night;  
With arms thrown wide, a haven brings,  
For fleeting joy and tender things.  
Though storms may rage and tempests roar,  
Its heart beats strong forevermore.  
Oh, may we learn from yonder tree,  
To stand with grace, like it, and be free.  

---

**The Sky**  

The sky above, a canvas wide,  
With nature’s colors, brushed with pride;  
Each cloud a dream, each star a sigh,  
And every dawn a sweet goodbye.  
The winds that stir the evening air,  
Bring promises the heart can share;  
In whispers soft, they come to play,  
The sky, our home, both night and day.  

---

**Whispers of the Earth**  

The earth beneath, so rich and deep,  
Holds secrets it is sworn to keep;  
In every stone, there lies a tale,  
Of summer’s sun and winter’s hail.  
Listen close, and you shall hear  
The whispers of the land so dear;  
For nature speaks in tones so clear,  
When heart is open, and life sincere.
