The trees are in their autumn glory,
The leaves are sinking, slowly falling;
All other things but trees are stories,
But trees are their own topalling.

The stars are glimmerings of infinity,
And the great moon makes no mistakes;
But in the morn, through their mutiny,
The trees do yield when silence breaks.

- Joyce Kilmer
