The trees that have it in their pent-up buds
To darken nature and be summer woodsâ€”
Let them think twice before they judge me.  

December, the month of quiet and not
to be sawn until like a moon through night, 
Stay from a time that has gone by:  

Winter too will wink at me, as if
Each flexible limb, long turned aside,
To voice again my ragged breathing.

- Robert Frost
