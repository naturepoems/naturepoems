The Silent Woods
Amongst the trees, a whisper low,
The silent woods hold sacred tales,
In their embrace, we come to know,
The truth of life that never fails.

Branches twist like ancient pens,
Writing stories in the air,
Each rustle echoes, time transcends,
In the quiet, we find prayer.

- Aasta Holth
