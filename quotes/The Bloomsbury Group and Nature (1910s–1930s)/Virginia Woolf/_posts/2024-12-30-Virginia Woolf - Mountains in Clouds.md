Clouds gather,
A shifting tapestry,
Upon the mountains,
In shades of blue and grey,
And down below,
The fields spread golden,
As the sunlight bends,
In a labor of grace.
Life, it eternalizes,
Within these realms of ðŸŒ³ .
Nature, whispering legends,
Soothes the troubled heart, afloat.

â€” **Virginia Woolf, Mountains in Clouds**

- Virginia Woolf
