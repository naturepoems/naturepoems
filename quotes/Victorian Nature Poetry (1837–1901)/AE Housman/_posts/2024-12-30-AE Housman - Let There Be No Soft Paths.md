Let there be no soft leeward paths,
No gentle winds to play this day;
For all my dreams are bound to earth,
Yet cast like drifting leaves away.

So as I tread this woodland path,
I find the echoes haunt my soul,
The rush of spring, the song of wraiths,
Reminds me of my lost control.

But nature’s song is sweetly sung,
Despite regrets that weigh me down,
A solace found in songs long flung,
Will help me wear my broken crown.

- AE Housman
