Echoes of the Forest

Each step upon the soft earth,
a conversation with roots and boughs,
as ancient whispers twirl in the air,
a melody sung by all of life.

Birdsong spills from branch to branch,
a lively chatter of instincts core,
as sunlight filters down like prayer,
making emeralds of the leaves.

Here, time dissolves, and I am whole,
each heartbeat intertwined,
in this cathedral formed by the wild,
a reverence that knows no end.


- María Pizarro
