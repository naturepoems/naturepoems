Ode on Melancholy

No, no! go not to Lethe, neither twist
Wolf’s-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;
Nor suffer thy soul to be a place of woes,
Lost and weighed down deep in vainly bitterness;

But when the melancholy mood will blend,
With reason’s eyes;  when flowers weep,
Plucked and caught beneath each tremulous call,
And boundless clouds will always share the light—

Only that in light’s bright dawn are flowers bright!
*In things we stay close where the hope holds.*

- John Keats
