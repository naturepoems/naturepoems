SONNET XXXVI

Every day, I can feel the summer heat,
Licks like a fire, it reminds me of you; â€”
And every day your eyes await my greeting,
The gold of sun upon the blue.
This summer dawn, when all the world feels free,
The honeysuckle clings to my spine,
The azure sky speaks of possibility,
Yet your touch remains only in my mind. 


- Edna Saint Vincent Millay
