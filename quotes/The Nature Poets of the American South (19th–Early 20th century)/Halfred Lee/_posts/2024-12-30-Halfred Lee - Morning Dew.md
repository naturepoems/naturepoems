Morning Dew

With dawn's first light, the world awakes,  
Each blade of grass, a promise makes.  
The dew drops glisten, pearls of grace,  
Nature's touch on earth's embrace.
  
Birds sing sweetly, welcoming day,  
As sunbeams chase the night away.  
In every color, life anew,  
The beauty found in morning dew.


- Halfred Lee
