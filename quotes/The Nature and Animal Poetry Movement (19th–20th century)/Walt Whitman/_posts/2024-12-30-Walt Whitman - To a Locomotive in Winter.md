To a Locomotive in Winter

Thee for my recitative!
Thee in the driving storm even as now—thee in the rushing steam,
Thee in the cold wind and the wet of the day—thee in my car’s
rushing down the tracks,
Thee are the force that we know.

The dark of the evening with the flickering lights,
The sound of engine thrumming like a distant sea.
Thou bringer of Spring and Summer! 
Thou art the stream of life!


- Walt Whitman
