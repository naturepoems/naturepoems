The grass so little has to do,
A Sphere of simple green,
Yet Art in the mountain dew
To you would seem, was seen.

To see a deer, or cricket call,
That is all we're ask'd;
And only Pray'a little fall 
Before our eyes, at last.

Yet nothing would it touch the grass —
That little flower in sight —
And on its face lie down and pass
That long, elusive night —

It – only marks, the pleasure there
And hints a hidden crown —
Yet here an upheaval knock, still air —
And diadems faintly down —

- Emily Dickinson
