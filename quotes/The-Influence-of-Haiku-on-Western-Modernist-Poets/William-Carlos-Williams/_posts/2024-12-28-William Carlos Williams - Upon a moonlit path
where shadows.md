where shadows"

quote: "Upon a moonlit path,
where shadows lengthen,
whispers of grasses sway
and meet the glow of dusk.

Unseen, the nightingale
sings softly to the stars,
each note a pulse of air,
each breath an embrace of peace."

Upon a moonlit path,
where shadows lengthen,
whispers of grasses sway
and meet the glow of dusk.

Unseen, the nightingale
sings softly to the stars,
each note a pulse of air,
each breath an embrace of peace.

- William Carlos Williams
