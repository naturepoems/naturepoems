An Autumn Day

A day in autumn, crisp and clear,
The leaves fall gently, a golden sea,
As I walk the path with a heart full of cheer,
The beauty of nature brings joy to me.

Each breath of air, a whisper of change,
The abundance of harvest, a sight to behold,
The world around me seems wondrously strange,
A tapestry woven with colors so bold.

As the sun begins to set in the west,
And shadows stretch long upon the ground,
I bow my head, in gratitude blessed,
For the simple pleasures that can be found.

- John Burroughs
