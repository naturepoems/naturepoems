O to the dead, the dead,  
The unbeholden, the unrecogniz'd;  
For you, O death, for you,  
The wide-headed feral dogs,  
For you that never would materialize;  
For the constellations that arise with my name!  
For the broken-ocean where the waves tether through my bones!  
You, wandering animal, will be with me.

- Walt Whitman
