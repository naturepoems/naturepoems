The Sea—an Oration
The Sea, the Sea!
What does it know of me,
What, save a bit of foam 
From my poor breath,
When I am gone, and I am dumb?
\nWhat does it tell of me?
That I am a consequence—
That I awake, and laugh, and die
There, where he lies—
And he, perhaps, is a consequence, too—
But what is a consequence, 
To him, creeps past?
What do I matter to it?
And the pulsing wave is nothing,
Nothing but me,
Like air above, below, so buoyantly false—
The Sea, the Sea,
Amazes me—
\nIt is combined of tears,
Of hope, of horror, and regret—
Is it not so? Is not he me?

- George Meredith
