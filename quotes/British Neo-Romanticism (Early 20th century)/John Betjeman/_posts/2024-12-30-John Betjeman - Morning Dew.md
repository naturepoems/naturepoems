The dew upon the morning grass,
A world awash in diamond light,
Here, time seems slow, as moments pass,
In Natureâ€™s arms, I find delight.

The sun peeks through, a warming ray,
Each glimmer spells a brand new day,
And as I breathe the fragrant air,
I feel the whispers, everywhere.

- John Betjeman
