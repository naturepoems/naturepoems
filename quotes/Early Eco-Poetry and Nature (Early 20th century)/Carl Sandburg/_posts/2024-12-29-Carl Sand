FIREPLACE
When the winter flames 
shimmer from the bedroom,  
the dark wood in the dusk  
dances with light.  
The blades of the trees outside  
bring their hands to the fire,  
a soft singe  
in the heart of snow;  
this the story alive  
  
  
touching stone to stone,  
a timeless warmth beneath the skin.  


- Carl Sandburg
