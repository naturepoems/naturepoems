The Cloud

I am the cloud, and I am the sky:
Beneath me lurks the thunder's might,
And when I pass the sun shines bright.
I watch the earth, so low and shy,
Yet I can lift her every sigh.

And when I weep, the valleys sway,
And when I smile, the meadows play,
I am the cloud, and I am the sky;  
I twinkle in the dew's bright gleam,
A fleeting wisp of love's soft dream.

- Marjorie Pickthall
