The Great Figure

Among the rain  
and lights  

I saw the figure  
5  

in the black  

of the city,  

and the fire  

with the green light  

struck the  

homeless,  

and great misfortune took  

mankind  

gripped at the throat  

and left him dust  

among the trees  
slowly falling.

- William Carlos Williams
