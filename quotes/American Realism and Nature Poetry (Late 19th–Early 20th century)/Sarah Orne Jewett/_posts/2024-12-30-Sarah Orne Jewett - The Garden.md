The Garden

The garden's clean, beneath the trees,  
A framed horizon in views supreme.  
A land of dreams, where dappled ground  
Calls all in nature to find the gleam.  
Here graceful flowers drop their leaves,  
And bird songs stir the evening air;  
Come walk with me, for all the year—  
The joys in leaves when summer's fair.

Let's wander where the roses climb  
And touch the petals of wild aster's blush.  
The garden plays with colors bright;  
Where sunbeams dance, and shadows hush  
In angles neat, by every fall  
They beckon me upon my quest,  
It offers peace that we must seek,  
Between the blooms my heart finds rest.

- Sarah Orne Jewett
