A vale of peace, where silence reigns,
Among the hills, where memory gains,
A path unwinds, through wood and stream,
In nature’s arms, I dare to dream.

From every stone and every blade,
The songs of earth so gently fade,
Yet in this stillness, I shall find,
The flowing essence of mankind.


- Roger Fry
