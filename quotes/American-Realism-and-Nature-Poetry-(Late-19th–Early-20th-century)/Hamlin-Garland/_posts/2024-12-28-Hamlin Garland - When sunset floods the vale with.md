When sunset floods the vale with gold,
And shadows creep across the hills,
In silence, peace, this world enfolds,
While evening's breath a stillness fills.
O nature's balm, so pure and sweet,
Where weary souls can find their rest,
A prayer of gratitude repeat,
And bide within her gentle breast.

- Hamlin Garland
