The Hayfield 

I march on the right, amid the blue,
                My heart is heavy with the dew;
The skimming lark sings clear and fine,
                And the golden thread of sunlight shines.

Before me spreads the verdant vale,
                With touches soft of summer pale;
Over fields ripe with evening glowâ€”
                Sweetness unfolds as I walk low.


- William Morris
