The Dewdrops

When morning breaks, so fresh and bright,
The world adorned in crystal sheen,
Each blade and bloom a pure delight,
With dewdrops clinging, softly gleaned.

Like diamonds dropped from heaven's hand,
They twinkle in the early morn,
A choir of nature's sweet command,
As daylight's gentle heart is born.

Oh, fragile beads of light, so rare,
Hold fast the magic of the day,
In every whisper of the air,
A lesson taught in nature’s play.

- Amelia Welby
