To the Grasshopper

O Thou that swing'st upon the trrees,
The gentle air thy song-rapt voice is speeding,
Thy shrill delights, thou flighty breeze,
With every rise, thou seem'st to lead me!

Then let me, happy as the blade,
In thy embrace, and sing thy story,
For all the memories, softly laid,
Bring nature's hush, and win the glory!

- Robert Herrick
