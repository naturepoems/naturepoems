The Pine
---

Lofty Pine! I see you stand,
With arms that reach to the sky—
Your verdant needles hold the land,
Your roots keep dreams alive, not shy.

With every season, you bear witness,
To life’s quick turn, to summer’s kiss,
Standing resolute against the storm,
In fierce winds, you find your form.

---

So let your spirit guide me true,
Through steadfastness, I grow with you.


- Henry David Thoreau
