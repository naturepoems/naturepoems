The Twilight

At twilight’s edge, the world transforms,
As day surrenders, darkness warms;
The sky ablaze with colors bright,
In lovers' hues, the dance of light.

The stars emerge, in velvet skies,
With whispered hopes, as daylight dies;
The nightingale begins to sing,
A serenade, of love's sweet spring.

In every shadow, secrets swirl,
In twilight's glow, a tale unfurl;
As day departs, the night is here,
A canvas wide, of dreams sincere.

- Thomas Wentworth Higginson
