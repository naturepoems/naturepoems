The Eyes of Mary

The eyes of Mary are bright and clear,
Like the heavens fresh after rain,
They beckon with a gentle cheer,
And offer solace from the pain.

In dawn-lit fields where the daisies grow,
Her laughter echoes through the vale,
And in the vale, the wildflowers show,
The beauty of a soft-spoken tale.

The winds weave through her flowing hair,
With fragrance of the blooming thyme,
And nature whispers in the air,
In melody, of joy sublime.


- Mary Webb
