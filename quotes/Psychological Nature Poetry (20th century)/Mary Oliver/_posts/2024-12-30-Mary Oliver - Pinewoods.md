Pinewoods

In the pinewoods, far away
from the city and the sun,
your face will be full of sunlight
and all the blue sky
will stretch around you.
In the pinewoods, far away
there is an air that moves
your thoughts like dry leaves in the wind.
In the pinewoods, far away,
your soul will slip away
into the thickest green shadows
and hover there
with arms held open in the sun.
In the pinewoods, far away
from the city and the sun.
In the pinewoods, far away.
These thoughts will tell you
that even the dullest were wise,
that all the bright creatures understand.
In the silence and air,
you will understand also.
The mountain meadows
and the deep forests will fit you
in the softness of their embrace,
you will know at last how to hold
for everything that vanished in the dark,
this light that has gotten too strong.
These trees swing around you
with their blossom of old safety,
whatever that is. There is no
word you can wear like a coat
to keep out the light. It is all over you.

- Mary Oliver
