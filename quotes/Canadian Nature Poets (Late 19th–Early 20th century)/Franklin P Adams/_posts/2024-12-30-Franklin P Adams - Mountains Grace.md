Mountain's Grace

The mountains stand with silent pride,
In cloaks of snow, their shoulders wide,
Guardians of secrets, old and wise,
They touch the clouds, embrace the skies.

Through valleys low and rivers swift,
Nature’s artistry, a perfect gift,
In every summit, dreams reside,
And in their shadows, fears abide.


- Franklin P Adams
