A snowy hush, a tranquil scene,
In winter's grip, the world is keen;
The trees wear coats of glimmering white,
Transforming earth in pure delight.

Each flake a promise, soft and true,
With every breath, the world anew;
In silence deep, our hearts unite,
In winter's warmth, we find the light.

- Vladimir Solovyov
