Thy voice is the music of wild whisperings—
When evening twilight bids the day farewell,
A lark does rise from little water springs
To greet the colors where the shadows fell.

The boughs do bend above the silver stream
That sparkles brightly as it flows along—
And time itself is woven in this dream: 
A world of quiet, freedom, and song.

And Nature's heart, aglow with peaceful breath,
Cradles the joys of all that we hold dear;
Each leaf, each breeze, surrendering to death—
Yet life renews its essence year by year.
