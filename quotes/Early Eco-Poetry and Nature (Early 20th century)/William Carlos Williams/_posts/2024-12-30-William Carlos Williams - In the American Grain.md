In the American Grain

A war
in which I shall
give mine

unobstructed

a freedom

that I have called

nothing and take from it

my glance
of viewing.

The grasses!

By no reasons

to be represented
no marching from one

end to the other,

In silent spring,

volcanic rimmed, they have

held out to me

as fine asâ€”

like stars live whoever that light,

On wildness then!
and most quietly as a

drift of halos,

To grace is its flow
on accurate earth.

- William Carlos Williams
