The tide rises, the tide falls,
The twilight darkens, the sky falls,
The sea will come and go,
And the vast waves, black and still,
Shall come and cover the shore anew.

And the voice of waves shall sing,
Across the night, across the sleep,
The simple sound, the constant vows,
Of nature's never-ending song.

And still in time will come unfurls,
The myriad mysteries of light,
From the dull night shall arise again,
The sun, the moon, the stars, in splendor bright.

So rests the depth of the sea,
And the gentle night shall be,
In its soft embrace, beneath the sky,
Forever, sweetly, sand shall lie.


- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
