The Wild

In the heart of the wilderness wild and free,  
The echoes throb with life’s joyous decree;  
Where the torrents roar as they rush to the sea —  
Here’s the realm of the wild, eternally.

With the mountains steep and the skies so high,  
The pulse of nature sings echoing nigh;  
When the shadows fall and the stars awaken,  
In this grand expanse, my spirit is taken.


- G L D Mackay
