...I looked to the trees
for an answer,
and the flower said,
under its petals in the moon-light
it has gone to the deep, dark earth.

But here is where I sink,
under the clear blue and gold
ready and locked in a breath,
for the dry comb of a bee, 
for the fishing line hanging,
one single thread.

I will hang on beneath; it is summer.
So let the stars scatter above us
like summer flowers before the rain.

Let the winds read their papers;
let the bees buzz.
Let the child laugh in his childâ€™s
freedom, knowing he is the world.
