A gentle rain on thirsty earth,
The murmur of a brook gives birth,
To feelings deep like ancient lore,
Each drop a whisper, forevermore.

In the hush of dawn, the world awakes,
And every creature gently shakes.
Nature’s rhythm, a sacred song,
Reminds us where we all belong.

Amid the chaos and the strife,
This melody breathes the essence of life.
In every petal, every stone,
The soul remembers it is not alone.


- Juliusz Słowacki
