To an Isle in the Water

On the island, time stands still,
Where quiet waters lap the shores,
And every breeze is steeped with dreams,
Where moments linger, life restores.

The reeds, they whisper ancient tales,
And willow branches brush the ground,
The softest breath of summer’s breath,
Awakens blossoms all around.

Here cicadas hum their melodies,
A lullaby to heart and heart,
In this fragment of paradise,
Beneath the dancing hues of art.

Oh, how the world comes alive,
In nature’s throbbing, vibrant choir.
As currents swirl and eddy by,
Here on this isle, I find my fire.
—Louis MacNeice
