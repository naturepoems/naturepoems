For winter's rains and ruins
Are over, and all the season
Of snows and the sun's errors
And the white and golden weather
Shall be no more, but only
The stars, the summer's bounty
And purple mists and shadows
Of loss and the soft dark flowers.

And frost and fire shall meet,
And autumn's golden harvest
Shall vanish in the sky.
Beauty's hands shall hold them
And love shall crown their hours.

 - From "The Garden of Proserpine"

- Algernon Charles Swinburne
