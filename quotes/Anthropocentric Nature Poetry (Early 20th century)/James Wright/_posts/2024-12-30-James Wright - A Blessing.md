Before the sun rises, I will be gone.
When I pass among the trees, I will disappear...
These trees that more and more reserve to themselves
They touch me; they lull me into a sleeping state,
A grove of aspens that whispers at twilight,
A good day to breathe, a good night to sleep.
In those first moments of dusk,
In the waste of evening light,
Leaves touching ... it all, it all comes back,
My life settled into the rhythm of the leaves.
This is my joy and pain, a simple song sung well.
A tree as the sun falls, becomes a darker shadow.
And me?
I will be the quiet hum of heartbeats beneath the stars.

â€” "A Blessing"
