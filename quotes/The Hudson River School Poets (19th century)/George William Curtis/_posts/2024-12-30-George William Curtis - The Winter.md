The Winter

In winter’s hold, the world lies still, 
Encased in white, a hoary chill; 
The trees like sentinels stand high, 
With flakes of snow that autumn sighs. 

The winds do howl, a wild refrain, 
While quiet whispers echo plain; 
A universe of peace unfolds, 
As nature’s story gently molds. 

With every gust, the frosty breath, 
Transports the dreams of life and death; 
And in this cold, a warmth we seek— 
In moments still, our hearts do speak. 

O winter, cloak of gentle grace, 
Wrap me tight in your embrace; 
For in your depths, I sense the fire— 
The essence of my heart’s desire.

- George William Curtis
