The River

The river flows with silver grace,
Through valleys green and hills so bare;
In every turn, I find a trace,
Of nature’s heart, in flowing air.

Each ripple speaks of time’s embrace,
Of memories both sweet and rare;
In harmony, we intertwine,
The river's song is truly fair.

- Thomas Woolner
