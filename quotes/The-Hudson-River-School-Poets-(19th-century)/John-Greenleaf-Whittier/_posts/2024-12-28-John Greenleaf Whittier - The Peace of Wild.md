The Peace of Wild Things

  I go among the trees and sit still;
  All my thoughts hold their breath,
  I come into the peace of wild things
  Who do not tax their lives with forethought
  Of grief.

  I come into the presence of still water.
  And I feel above me the day-blind stars
  Waiting with their light.
  For a time
  I rest in the grace of the world,
  And am free.


- John Greenleaf Whittier
