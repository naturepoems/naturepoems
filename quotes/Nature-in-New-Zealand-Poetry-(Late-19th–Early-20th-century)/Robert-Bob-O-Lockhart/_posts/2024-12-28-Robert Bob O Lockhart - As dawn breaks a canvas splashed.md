As dawn breaks, a canvas splashed bright,
With the palette of day chasing away night,
The dew on the petals, like jewels in the sun,
Nature awakens, and the day’s just begun.

The brook murmurs softly, a sweet serenade,
While the willows sway gently, in coolness they fade,
Embracing the magic that each sunrise brings,
In every heartbeat, the wonder life sings.

- Robert Bob O Lockhart
