Rebirth

Awake, O heart! And hark unto the morn;
  For in the dew-drenched grass the light unfolds;
  Life's miracle, all nature sweetly born,
  Through buds and blooms that grace the world's enfolds.

The birds are singing, heralds of the sun,
  As lilies nod their heads in joyous glee;
  The world awakens, each newly found,
  And Life, reborn, is nature’s wild decree.

The hum of bees, the soft caress of air,
  All mingle with the fragrance of the dirt,
  As every seedling stirs, and softens care,
  And wraps the earth in garments, rich and curt.

Rebirth, come softly, as the winds do blow,
  And fill our hearts with beauty's calm refrain;
  As nature weaves her magic—life will flow,
  And in her arms, we find our true domain.
