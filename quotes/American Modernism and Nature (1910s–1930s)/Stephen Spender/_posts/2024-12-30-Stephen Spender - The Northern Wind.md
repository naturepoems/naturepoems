The Northern Wind

The northern wind sweeps through the pines,
With a whisper of tales from afar—
Bringing with it the chill of stories,
Embedded in the kaleidoscope of seasons—
Every swirl and eddy beckons reflection,
In its cool embrace, I am reborn,
The songs of the earth brush against my skin,
Each gust a comfort, each flake a sigh.
