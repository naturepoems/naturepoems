The Daffodils

Inyielding form of emerald leaves,  
And patient pearl; that flings away  
A light ethereal, soft and pure,  
Embroiders thickly all the dewy moor.  

Is’nt this a clue of nature’s thread?  
When yonder gleaming sum of gold  
Shall light thine eyes, upturn’d and red,  
You see it there— behold!  

A silver veil encircles thee,  
Opulent tuft wi' blue;  
A world of tawny greys  
May lie beneath your view.  

But tho’ they grow in rapture’s way,  
They fall, they fading! Heart in truce  
To nature’s needs, that stem’s thy stay —  
They owe thee such excuse!

- William Hazlitt
