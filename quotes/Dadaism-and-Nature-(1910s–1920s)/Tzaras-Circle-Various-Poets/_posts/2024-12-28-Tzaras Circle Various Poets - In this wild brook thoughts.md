In this wild brook, thoughts dissolve,
       fractals of déjà vu splinter,
  remnants of laughter echo  
    from petrified trees.
   The ethos of birds  
        carried on a breeze—
  whispers intertwining,  
      stitching old rifts with ephemeral silk,
         the world a jigsaw, incomplete.
