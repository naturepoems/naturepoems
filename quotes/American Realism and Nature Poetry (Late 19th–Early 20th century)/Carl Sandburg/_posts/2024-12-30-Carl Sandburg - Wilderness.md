Wilderness

The trees are not tall and the leaves
green and yellow are neither bright nor dark.
In the wilderness, a host of people live
and the great woods lie dead.
I saw a river by the foreground
and a lake by the border.
Here is a summer night—
and the houses, empty and dark,
stare out into the wilderness.

- Carl Sandburg
