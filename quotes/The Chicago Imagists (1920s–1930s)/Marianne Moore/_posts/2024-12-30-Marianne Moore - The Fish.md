The Fish
         I caught a tremendous fish
         And held him beside the boat
         Half out of water, with my hook
         Fast in a corner of his mouth.
         He didn’t return my stare.
         He was inside, with his struggle and I,
         Outside, and he was fish. 

         It was more like the tipping
         Of scales than the immaterial
         Light of the fin, which, in a moment,
         Slipped through my fingers, rise and fall
         The shallow bow half filled with orange
         And mackerel map on the surface.

         And I, sheathed in my laboring skin,
         Staring at the glistening scales
         Like rubble, and he lies still.
         I will signal the sea add more to my life.
         My blood still pulsing in him, almost a child
         My wonder was pure within him, I missed it.
         In a hurry my foot would still seem awake.
         Nothing, mackerel sun, like tiny moons
         Looked at, turned golden. 

         I let the fish go - my fish, the fish of the sea.
         I think he knew I sent him the warmth,
         That he came back, strange ocean, enhance, enhance.
         Or perhaps he knew he could never die

- Marianne Moore
