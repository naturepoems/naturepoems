The mountain rises bold and regal,
A sentinel of rolling green,
Each summit pierces tranquil heavens,
In quiet strength, the world is seen.
And lakes like mirrors hold the sky,
Reflecting dreams that nature spills,
In solitude, I find my purpose,
Amidst the breeze and echoing hills.
Each rock, a witness of the ages,
With stories carved by wind and rain,
In the depths of nature's splendor,
I seek my heart, I seek my pain.

- Marina Tsvetaeva
