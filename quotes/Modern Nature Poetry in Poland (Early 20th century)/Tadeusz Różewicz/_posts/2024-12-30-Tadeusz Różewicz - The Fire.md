Flames dance
around the fire,
consuming the wood,
a slow, deliberate ritual,
yet in the ashes
we find the remnants
a whisper of what once was,
a tether to a moment
we cannot contain.

Night swallows the embers,
as dreams rise,
carried on smoke,
into the infinite sky,
where nature’s breath
riddles the dark.


- Tadeusz Różewicz
