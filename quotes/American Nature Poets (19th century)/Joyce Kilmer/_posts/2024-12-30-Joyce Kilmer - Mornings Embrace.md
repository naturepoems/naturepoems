On dewy mornings, crisp with chill,
As sunlight kisses morning's face,
The world awakens, dreams fulfill,
And nature whispers in embrace.

The petals glisten, bright and bold,
The birds soar high, they soar so free;
In nature’s arms, the heart unfolds,
A symphony that sings, ‘Just be!’

- Joyce Kilmer
