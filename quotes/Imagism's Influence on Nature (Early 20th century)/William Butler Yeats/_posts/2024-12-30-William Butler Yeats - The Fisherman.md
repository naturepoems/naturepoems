The Fisherman
Although I be but a fisherman strange,
With nets that sometimes catch nothing in range,
The rivers flow and lilies dance awake,
A bright white bird from the tempest does break.

On the crest of the waters, the sunlight will rise,
With funny dimples and sounds that surprise.
While the feathered friends around build their nest,
I gather my heart wherever I can rest.

- William Butler Yeats
