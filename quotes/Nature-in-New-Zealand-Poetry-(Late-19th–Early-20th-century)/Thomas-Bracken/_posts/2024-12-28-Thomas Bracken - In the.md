In the Garden
 
In the garden, where silence
Lies softly on every flower,
And the heart of each bloom beats
With delicate love in its hour—

Where the petals are kissed by the dew,
And rich scents are wafted around,
Here the spirit of Nature is true,
In this stillness, her beauty is found.

Let the sun sprinkle gold on the leaves,
Let the trees speak of ages gone by;
In each passing breath that one weaves,
In the garden, true happiness lies.

- Thomas Bracken
