The Sea and the Jungle

There’s a camp in the jungle —
The blaze of a fire so bright,
But darkness falls too quickly,
And you cannot see the light.

The sea comes creeping softly —
Great dunes rise in the night.
With the sky and the stars winking,
The death of the sun is sight.

My time is a dream —’tis folly,
In the tongue of our dawning years,
But peace is about the corner,
In the heart of the wild—no fears!

- Rudyard Kipling
