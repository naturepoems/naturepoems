Dawn

In the shimmer of the new-born day,
  The world lays soft and pale;
From mist and fog, in gentle sway,
  The sun begins to sail.

With blush of rose, and gold’s bright gleam,
  The mirthful morn awakes;
As nature dances ‘neath the beam,
  The quiet heart now breaks.

So rise and hear the glorious flight,
  The lark sings clear and true;
In dawn’s embrace, find pure delight
  In everything anew.


- Mary Gilmore
