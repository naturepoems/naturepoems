A Route of Evanescence  
With a revolving Cloud  
A sudden Blow - from the Desert  
It directs the note of the Proust -  

The Honey-bee is out in the Light  
To hover and skirt that dew;  
Strange blooms are thickening  
And laughing to come up in bloom -  

The wind has its promise in its music  
And beckons upward more!  
Delicately - like days of the silent  
Repose that curl the breeze -  

Enthralled in a vacillating ring  
Directs the scenery like a light,  
Measured by the sceptre that reigns  
In Nature - a phantom in flight!

- Emily Dickinson
