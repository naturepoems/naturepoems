Cloaked in Green

Cloaked in the embrace of green,
The forest holds my secrets,
As I wander beneath the boughs,
Lost in the ancient whispers,
Of nature’s timeless heart.

The earth sighs beneath my feet,
Each step a prayer to the ground,
As the sun filters through leaves,
Painting patterns on my skin,
With the warmth of sacred light.

In this realm of tranquility,
I find pieces of my soul,
Scattered like seeds in the breeze,
Nurtured by the wild’s devotion,
Where I am both lost and found.

- Konstantīns Raudive
