The Heart of the Rose
 
Red rose in the corner of the garden,  
The petals whisper tales of love,  
In summer’s light, so soft and bright,  
Underneath the sky above.  

With every breeze that stirs the air,  
Your fragrance dances, sweet and rare,  
A silent song, a gentle sigh,  
A beauty that will never die.

- Edward Burne-Jones
