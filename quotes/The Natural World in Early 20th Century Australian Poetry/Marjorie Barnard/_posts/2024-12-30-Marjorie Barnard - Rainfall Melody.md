The rain begins its gentle fall,
A symphony on parched dry land,
Each drop a note to natureâ€™s call,
In dance with earth, a soft command.

The flowers lift their heads and sway,
Embracing life with every drop;
For in the rain, the world gives way,
To growth that never learns to stop.

- Marjorie Barnard
