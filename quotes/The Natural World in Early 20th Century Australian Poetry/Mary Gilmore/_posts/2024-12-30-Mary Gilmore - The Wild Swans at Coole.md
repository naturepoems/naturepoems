The Wild Swans at Coole

The trees are in their autumn beauty,
  The woodland paths are dry,
Under the October twilight the water
  Mirrors a still sky;
Upon the glassy water among the stones
  Are nine-and-fifty swans.

The curlew calls, and the great grey heron
  Is flying to his nest,
The night's whirl awakens the waning stars
  The full moon in the west
Is a silvered sea, and the autumn light,
  Is led by the swans' flight.

And the most of us unite our swift, sad thought,
  To lie on marble," said, "The swans move on into the night."
