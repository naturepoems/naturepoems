Requiem for a River

The river runs deep, the river runs wide,
And the voice becomes a song,
The voice of memory rises and falls,
In ripples of time, in whispers.

Let us hear the echoes, let the riverâ€™s song
Flow beneath the silence of the earth,
Where the journey of life weaves
Through the fabric of existence.


- Judith Wright
