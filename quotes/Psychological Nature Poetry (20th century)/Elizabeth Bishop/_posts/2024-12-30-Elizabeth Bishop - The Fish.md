The Fish

I caught a tremendous fish
and held him beside the boat
half out of water, with my hands
a little cupped like buckets.
He didn’t fight.
He hadn’t fought at all.
He hung a grunting weight,
a drab and enormous fish
like a monster from the deep,
with scales like decay,
but it was a beauty –
dim, fluttering, and silver,
like the surface of a lake,
quiet and whispering to me
about the distances he’d traveled
just to meet me here.

I looked into his eyes
and saw the ocean reflected,
whole armies of fish
streaming toward the surface
and another world
would suck him down.
I knew then I would
let him go.  

I let the fish go.
