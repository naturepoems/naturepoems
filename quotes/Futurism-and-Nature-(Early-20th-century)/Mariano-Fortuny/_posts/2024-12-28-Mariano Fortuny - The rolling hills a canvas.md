The rolling hills, a canvas vast,
Painted with hues from the morning's cast.
The rivers flow like thoughts set free,
Winding through the heart of the green sea.

Mountains stand tall, guardians of time,
Their peaks reflect the sun's bright chime.
In every corner, life unfolds,
Nature's secrets in silence told.

- Mariano Fortuny
