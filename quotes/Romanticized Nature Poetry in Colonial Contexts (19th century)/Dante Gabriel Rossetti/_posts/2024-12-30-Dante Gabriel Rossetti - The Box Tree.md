The Box Tree

I
  The box tree trembles in the breeze,
     The fragrance lingers, cool and sure,
     In verdant shade where whispers squeeze,
     Each secret blooms, the world is pure.

II
  As dusk befalls with dreams reclined,
     I wander lost, beneath the flares,
     In these old woods, my heart defined,
     Each leaf a tale, free of cares.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
