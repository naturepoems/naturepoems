Stars pour like whispers from the night,
  A cascade of light in the velvet sky,
  They paint the vast, infinite canvas,
  Each a reminder of unseen stories.
  I lie on the cool earth, feeling small,
  Yet linked to it all—both dark and bright,
  In the solace of this cosmic play,
  I find a piece of eternity to hold.

  - from "Echoes of the Night" (1932)

- Virginia Woolf
