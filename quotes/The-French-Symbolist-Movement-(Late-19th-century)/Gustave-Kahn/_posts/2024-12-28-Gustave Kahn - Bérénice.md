Bérénice

The woods are full of whispers,
The trees stretch their limbs, the breeze slides,
Under the fabric of the leaves, and the night
Draws shyness from stars in silence.

O the soft touch of the sky!
Dreams flow in the gentle folds,
Drift like petals, caressed by air,
In gardens where shadows dance in the light.

- Gustave Kahn
