Autumn Song  
Beneath the rustling trees  
   and the scattered glow of dying leaves,  
I ponder the words,  
   the whispers that fall like rain  
of summers past, then find  
a single word,  
   a lull of breath,  
as still as twilight  
   on shimmering waters,  
inviting me closer  
  to this silent end.

- Louise Bogan
