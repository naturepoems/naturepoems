The woods stretch out, green and vast,
A world untouched by timeâ€™s cruel hand,
Sunlight filters through the branches,
Casting shadows that gently stand.

Every leaf tells a story,
Of seasons passed in silent grace,
The whispers of the wind echo,
In this tranquil, sacred place.

In the embrace of nature's arms,
Life breathes deep, the spirit soars,
In the woods, under azure skies,
Soul finds peace forever more.

- Julian Tuwim
