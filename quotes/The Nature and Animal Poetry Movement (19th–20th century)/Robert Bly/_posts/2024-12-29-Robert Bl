The Man Who Could Not Stop Screaming

They say there is a man somewhere
Who could not stop screaming.
His head is not in the sky, as
Is too often said, but down the
Ground in the weeds, where he grasps
Each twitch of green life,
And the panic of everything
That crosses his path. 

This man is weeping fresh roses,
Shouting to the bumblebees
Moving under his feet
In a tickling rush. The sky weeps.

This man is the river, flowing
Through his dear screaming; his breath
Breaks the lines of depth
Turning in spirals
Under the wings of soft dark,
The sun a bitter fruit, falling.


A Dream of a Tree

There was a tree planted above the sea,
With roots drawn down into war,
Into the quiet belly of things.
The leaves breathe loudly there, O tree,
In a wide clasp around you, a peace that defies.
The twisting sky holds, the sun drips down, the
Sea collects its hoard of stones,
The tree reads the bones conveying beauty,
Each dewdrop a voice now.
As it shakes its hair out,
Waking the moon, tracing the light.


The River

When we were walking to the last creek,
With a wild scream, scattering the insects,
I saw that it was like a letter,
Like the great mind touching the earth.
The river plunged, through heavy stones,
Across green violets and broad lily pads.
I felt the pressure of silence, like
The weight of hands pressed heavy, pressed soft.
The river lies down its length,
In a whirling warmth of respite,
Under divinations at night,
Where moonlight speaks above the waves.


The Bridge

What is the bridge?
It is the last page of the summer,
The place where it ends,
The turn of fragrant air
And winding touch, soft around the heart.
The swell of the waters, full of unknowns,
Rising above the island of flowers.
What more can we say about this? An answer
Drawn from a drop of shadow, it trails off 
As beauty, full-eyed, confronts the silence,
The afternoon sun weeping through branches, a sigh.


In the Mountains

On the path through dry hills,
I saw the quiet exile, the distant pulse
Of trees screaming quietly above me,
For the long blue sky,
How it moves between branches,
Mothering the shifting shapes.

Each misty hand presses close,
And the cloud-birds of blossomed dark
Spur the voice of youth, each grass blade,
Each stone a heart,
Sings the song of what is unseen.


The Waterfall

The waterfall pours obsidian light,
Spilling all through the rocks,
Like autumn’s dust upon winter’s frame,
In a tranquil wind of hollowness,
Where echoes are breathing, the jagged smoothness
Of the river’s hymn forms a sound,
Crashing the land with notes of thunder.
I can see the night's heartsongs,
The hopes of the green things long buried.


Morning

In that soft dawn, pale foliage stir,
Cloud silver bleeding across the old soft grass,
Where the matted love cradled by dew,
Cradled by the arms of heavy trees,
Breathes a precipice of quiet,
Each sigh pressing alight
From the yawn of the world beginning,
Each fruit ripened, full of the voice of summer.


Hawk

The hawk swings low,
His voice a shadowed rambling,
Dancing across dim fields,
With the sudden lightness of a sigh,
The earth lifts from us as it folds,
Air above, golden and gleaming,
While the bright edges of winds stretch high,
As we move curl-ingly, tenderly,
Tracing the chase of shadows
Where the heart beats the loudest.


Tidal Pools

In the rippling pools,
Little fish dart right and left,
Ghosts playing beneath the waves,
Where the rocks breathe slowly,
Carrying the silken weight of light,
Bound to the green energy of motion.
They remind the stillness,
The echoing grace of water's hold,
Caressing deep the shines of water.


Evening

The tired evening swells around,
Calls of the last birds falling,
The gathering light trembling,
The gold arms of silence breathing,
With the soft thick scent of grass,
Woven thoughts of earth and air 
Waving their familiarity, a
Caress of beauty held close,
Soft and openly bare, lifted higher.


Winter Night

The sky twists around, thick and dark,
The snowflakes fall like thick dreams,
As a silver quilt spills from the heavens,
Covering the earthy world anew,
Where tenderness lies beneath,
The bite of frost glimmers, sharp—but
Still holds the tender breath of heal,
Grains of light falling on the world,
Even the hushed silences shall hold warmth,
Each tear—the soft envelope of nature.


The Desert

Upon the hot, wide plains,
Life crouches low around the sand,
With echoes of long-past memories,
A history woven into gold-threaded earth.
Each frame of bone becomes the focus,
Each breath the silence of nature,
The trees sprawling like ancient giants,
Adorned with the blessings of quiet shadow,
Where each grain gleams in whispers,
Reminds us of the child-born seed,
And the possibility of a thousand burst open dreams.


The Birth of the Night

When the stars burst alive and break,
Hoops of color bent into shadow,
As the silhouetted trees stand tall,
The moon climbs above the peaks,
Filling the valleys with deep blue(–)
The air freshens at the edges,
As whispers of night fall deep,
Craving an embrace, a feeling 
Of softness, a longing echoed,
An awakening to the verdant spiral.


The Old Red Fox

Hiding in that invisible twist,
The old red fox fixes its gaze,
And in the quiet dusk it curls,
Twirled up under thickets of thyme;
The echoing calls dance around,
Each shadow wing flutters close. 
He glides through the fading light,
Soft, distanced, yet the heart trembles,
A sudden spark bursts open within,
A fierce clarity of nature,
Sitting quiet until all fades.


The Edge of the Lake

The lake returns its surface to sky,
Evening reflecting where loved ones lie,
With allards—are breaths of the wild,
Embracing the golden grains spilling,
Each footfall leads where life pulses,
And paths of old resonate across the neck,
Awaking petals of memory keen,
Opening the breath of richer whispers, and
Embracing all that nature reveals, anew.
