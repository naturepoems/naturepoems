Oceans vast and deep, with your tides that arise,  
carry whispers of stories where the seagull flies.  
The salt of the sea, the wind’s softest song,  
reminds us of journeys that make the heart strong.

The waves crash and fall, in a rhythm divine,  
as the sun dips below, in a golden incline.  
In this natural dance, I lose track of time,  
nature’s sweet promise, a melody sublime.

- Émile Zola
