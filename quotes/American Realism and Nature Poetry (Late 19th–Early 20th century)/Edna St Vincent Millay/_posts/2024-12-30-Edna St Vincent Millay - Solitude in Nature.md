To be alone in Nature’s arms,
With every breeze, there comes a balm;
The flowers blooming, fresh and bright,
In solitude, I find my light.

The silent woods, they sing to me,
With every rustle, softly free;
In Nature’s warmth and gentle glow,
My heart can feel its seeds of hope.


- Edna St Vincent Millay
