quote: "A Song of the Road\nThere’s a road where the sun shines bright,\nAnd it leads away from the strife,\nWith the trees waving gently in the light,\nAnd the song of the birds is life.\nFollow the path, to the beautiful vale,\nWhere the rivers run clear and wide,\nAnd the flowers bloom and the deer will trail,\nIn the lap of nature’s side."

A Song of the Road\nThere’s a road where the sun shines bright,\nAnd it leads away from the strife,\nWith the trees waving gently in the light,\nAnd the song of the birds is life.\nFollow the path, to the beautiful vale,\nWhere the rivers run clear and wide,\nAnd the flowers bloom and the deer will trail,\nIn the lap of nature’s side.

- Siegfried Sassoon
