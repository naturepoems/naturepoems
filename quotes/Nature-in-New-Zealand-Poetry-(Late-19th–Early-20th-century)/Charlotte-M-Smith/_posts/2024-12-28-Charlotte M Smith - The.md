The Spring
With choral song the springtime breaks,  
Oft singing in the trees,  
The gentle breeze, like laughter wakes,  
The blooms upon the peas.  
The golden fields with yellow flowers  
Invite the honey bee,  
Each moment hush’d to feel the hours,  
That seek our souls to be.

The blossom'd boughs in varied grace  
Hang o'er the verdant green,  
And every joy will find a place  
To fill the spaces' scene;  
For nature—sprightly—laughing sings  
Against the azure skies,  
And in her beckoning, sweet springs  
She weaves our lives and ties.

- Charlotte M Smith
