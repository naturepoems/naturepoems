Whispers of the Wind

The wind carries secrets,
From the valleys to the peaks,
A timeless wanderer,
In whispers soft and sweet.
It dances through the branches,
With laughter in its sheets,
And rustles through the grasses,
Like a lover's gentle tease.

I hear the stories spinning,
Of the mountains, vast and grand,
Each breeze a silent promise,
Woven by nature’s hand.
So let the wind take me,
On its journey far and wide,
Where I might know the world,
And all its wildest ties.

— Wole Soyinka
