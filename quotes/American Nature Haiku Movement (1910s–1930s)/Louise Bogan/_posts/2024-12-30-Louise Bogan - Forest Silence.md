The forest held its breath,
The trees stood proud and tall,
Their limbs grasping softly at the twilight—
And in that moment,
A deer stepped quietly,
Offering grace in its silence.

Moonlight flowed like water,
Glistening on the moss,
While shadows danced
In ancient rhythms,
A song older than time.


- Louise Bogan
