The Fish
I caught a tremendous fish
and held him beside the boat
half out of water, with my hook
fast in his mouth. He didn’t even struggle.
He hung there, coming nearer and nearer
and I thought I had him, but he was
more than I had imagined, a great life,
a tremendous fish, and as I took him, I knew
I had changed, there was salt on my hands,
the sun like a blessing on the shore.

- Mary Oliver
