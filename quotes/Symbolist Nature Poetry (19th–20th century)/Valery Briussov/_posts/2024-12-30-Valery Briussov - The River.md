The River

Beneath the sky where whispers flow,
A river winds, a silken dream,
It carries tales the currents know,
Of time, of love, of timeless stream.

Each bend a glimpse of worlds anew,
Reflections dance upon the tide,
In emerald depths, old secrets brew,
Where nature’s heart and soul collide.

It murmurs soft to rocks and reeds,
A lullaby of life’s embrace,
In every ripple, memory breeds,
In every drop, a lover’s trace.

So sit beside this gentle stream,
And let its song wash over you;
For in its flow, we drift, we dream,
The river winds, and so do you.


- Valery Briussov
