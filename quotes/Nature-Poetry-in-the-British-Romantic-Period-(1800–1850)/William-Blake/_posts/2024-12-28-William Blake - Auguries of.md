Auguries of Innocence
To see a World in a Grain of Sand,
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,
And Eternity in an hour.

A Robin Redbreast in a Cage
Puts all Heaven in a Rage.
A dove house fill’d with doves and pigeons
Shudders hell thro’ all its regions.

A riddle or the Figge
Possesseth all to its heart.
A flower in a flowerbed,
A songbird of lily and reed.


- William Blake
