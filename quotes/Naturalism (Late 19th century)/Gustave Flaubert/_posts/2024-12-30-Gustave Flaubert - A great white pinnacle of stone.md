A great white pinnacle of stone,
That juts into the glowing sky;
And oh! the colors there have grown,
From golden hues to violet sighs.
Each night the stars descend like dew,
To kiss the blooms that flourish here;
In nature’s hand, a painter’s view,
A canvas filled with dreams so dear.


- Gustave Flaubert
