Orchard

     As a child I played in a garden,
     among your thorn trees,
     By the twisted roots and twisted branches,

     Your fragrant breath held gently,
     fierce as silk, fierce as the moment
     I held the garden with both hands,

     with eyes wide open, kept them wide, 
     as I was tender, as I was fierce
     â€”Fierce as the new blossom, fierce as the fruit.
