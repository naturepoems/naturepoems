In silence rolls the harvest moon,
   The fields are gold and brown;
   The quiet fall, like natureâ€™s tune
   Is sung in their renown.
   When twilight shades whisper before,
   The stars come twinkling back;
   A thousand spirits of yore
   Call forth the shadows black.
   And here where every creature shines,
   With tender grace divine,
   A bounty rich on earth aligns,
   As love of Life is mine.

- Sarah Orne Jewett
