Wildflower

A wildflower blooms
in the cracks of
this city street.
It stirs a kind of longing
inside my chest,
a reminder of open fields,
when everything was free. 

How the sun shone
on my youthful face,
one with nature,
one with the wind,
now I wander these walls
of concrete and steel,
feeling the pulse
of the earth still beating,
still alive beneath,
even here, in the hardest
of places.

Let it go, I say,
let the city crumble,
let the roads return to
The Wild, let the flowers
reclaim their space.
