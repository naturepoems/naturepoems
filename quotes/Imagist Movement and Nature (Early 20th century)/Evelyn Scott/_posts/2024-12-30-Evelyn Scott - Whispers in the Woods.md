The branches, twisted and strong,
Entwined in eager touch,
Like lovers lost in secret woods,
Their shadowed thoughts of each other.
The flutter of leaves above,
Whispers tales unheard,
As shadows dance like phantoms,
Fleeting, dreaming amidst the quiet night,
In darkened recesses of our hearts,
Where Nature breathes its sacred song.

- Evelyn Scott
