Tropical Rain

Each drop a tender embrace,
a soothing balm upon the skin,
with the sound of nature’s applause,
a symphony played in rhythms.

The earth drinks deeply, sighs,
as colors bloom in rapture,
a dance of life ignites anew,
every heartbeat in tune with rain.

I linger in this shower of whispers,
a cleansing fate of fleeting moments,
as the fragrance of earth rises,
a celebration of existence’ core.


- María Pizarro
