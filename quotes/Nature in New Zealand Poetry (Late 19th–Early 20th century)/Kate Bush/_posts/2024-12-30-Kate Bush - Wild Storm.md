A storm brews in the distant mountains,
a wild tempest painting the horizon gray.

Yet in the chaos lies the beauty,
a fierce reminder of nature's raw grace.

Lightning forks through the twilight sky,
each crack whispering a warning and a promise.

Dance in the rain, let it wash over you,
a baptism by the very breath of the earth.

- Kate Bush
