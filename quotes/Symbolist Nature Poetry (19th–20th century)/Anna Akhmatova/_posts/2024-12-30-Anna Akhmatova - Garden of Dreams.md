Garden of Dreams

In the garden where flowers bloom,
I wander lost in fragrant lanes,
The petals blush in softest hues,
And dance about like sweet refrains.

Amid the blooms, I close my eyes,
And let the world fade far away,
In nature's arms, I hear the song,
That carries my heart through the day.


- Anna Akhmatova
