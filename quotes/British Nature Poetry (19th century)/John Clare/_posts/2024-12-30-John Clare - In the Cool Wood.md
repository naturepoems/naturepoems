The woods have a trembling stillness all around,
   The soft winds murmur through the trees,
And the stars that glance from the sky profound
   Wink like silent jewels on the breeze.

Down in the wood by the fresh green glade,
   The wild daisies dance in the light,
The timid hare sits low in the shade,
   And the blossoms are wild with delight.

- John Clare
