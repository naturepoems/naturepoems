In the twilight woods where shadows play,
Soft whispers of leaves greet the ear,
A carpet of moss beneath the trees,
Nature encircles, drawing all near.

Fireflies flicker, lanterns of the night,
As stars awaken in the velvet sky,
In the stillness, a universe breathes,
In nature's arms, dreams dare to fly.

- Gustave Flaubert
