Song for a Dark Girl

Way Down South in Dixie
(Break the heart of me)
They hung my black young lover
To a wishbone tree.

Black like me.

The tree was all we had.
Black like me.

And now he swings in the wind.
(Break the heart of me)
He is a man who loved me,
And black like me.

Black like me.

- Langston Hughes
