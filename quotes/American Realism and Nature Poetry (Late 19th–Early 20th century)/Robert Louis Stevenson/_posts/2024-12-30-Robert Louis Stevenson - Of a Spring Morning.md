Of a Spring Morning
The little bird, the small, the sweet,  
The bird that sings  
On a branch of tree,  
Is full of joy,  
And all the sky is in her song  
A spring morning, in the light of gold,  
The world is fresh and new,  
It is a sweet story.  
Each leaf, each fragrant flower,  
Paint the colors bright  
That echo through the hours,  
Like playful children,  
Opening every door  
To life’s adventure.




- Robert Louis Stevenson
