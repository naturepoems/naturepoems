In the evening light, the mountains
   fold softly into shadows,
   the colors whisper of endings,
   as day yields to dusk,
                   and the waning sun
breaks into calm reflections.

   I sit wrapped in the quiet,
   lulled by the constant song
   of crickets and the breathing
   of the forest,
   here the wild things roam,
   and my heart finds peace
   among the earth's stories,
   written in the rustle of leaves,
   spoken between the stars.


- Wendell Berry
