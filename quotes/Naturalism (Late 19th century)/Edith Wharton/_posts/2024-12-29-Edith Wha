The wildflowers bloom in tangled grace,  
And in their colors pass a silent spell;  
I often catch the whispered night,  
As twilight sails across the vale.  
 
A single star breaks through the dark,  
Its gaze upon the world is kind;  
And in its light I find my truth,  
My hearts rest easy, and unwound.  

For nature speaks in vibrant hues;  
     Each petal is a tale of joyâ€”  
Through every turn of leaf and branch,  
I gather treasures of the day.  

The moonlight bathes the fields in peace,  
Where dreams take flight with every breeze,  
And as I walk,  
  I know I am;  
     A part of all this wonder here.

- Edith Wharton
