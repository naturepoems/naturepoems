When twilight falls and shadows blend,  
The world transforms in dusk's sweet grace,  
With fireflies dancing, stars ascend,  
The night unveils its soft embrace.

In nature's realm, a secret's kept,  
Within the whispers of the trees,  
In peace and calm, my spirit slept,  
In harmony with night's own breeze.

- Hjalmar Hegner
