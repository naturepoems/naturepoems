The sun has long been set,
The sun has long been set,

And while the dove and the moon reside,
Like summer blooms, on the path,

I see a farther side, green den,
And sense the moon is in no haste.

Under silver threads of trees,
In sweet, sweet solitude, I bide,

While enough silence soothes my plight,
Wrapped up by disuqiet sea of night.

Nature holds me, and fills my heart
With peace beyond all comprehension, yet,
'Tis here my truest self shall start,
Originating in affection and creation, set.

Together with hues of dawn.
Forever free, where I belong.

- William Wordsworth
