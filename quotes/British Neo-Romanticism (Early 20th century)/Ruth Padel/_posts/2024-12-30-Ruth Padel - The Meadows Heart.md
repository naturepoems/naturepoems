The Meadow’s Heart
In the heart of the meadow,  
where wildflowers bloom bright,  
colors explode into song,  
a cacophony of life,  
celebrating warmth and light.

Butterflies soar above,  
poets of the air,  
as honeybees hum,  
a busy ballet of creation  
set against a backdrop of green.

Here, beneath the wide sky,  
I breathe deeply,  
letting the chorus of the earth  
remind me of my roots  
in this thriving tapestry of life.

- Ruth Padel
