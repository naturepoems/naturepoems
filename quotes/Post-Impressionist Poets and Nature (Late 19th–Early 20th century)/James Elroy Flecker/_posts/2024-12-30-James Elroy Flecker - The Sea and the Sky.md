The Sea and the Sky

O ocean wide, in depths so blue, 
With glimmering waves and secrets true, 
Reflecting skies of azure sweep, 
Where dreams of sailors dare to leap.

Your whispers echo on the shore, 
In every breath, your tales implore; 
The dance of light, the play of time, 
In every heart, you make it rhyme.

And in your arms, the world is born, 
From every wave where hopes adorn, 
A never-ending symphony, 
The sea, the sky—our poetry.

- James Elroy Flecker
