The Cat

The cat

that I kept

waiting for hours

stayed away for

a month

but this morning

is excited

a tail

up the street

and I was waiting.

The wind is

just a hint

and I heard,

The crocus brought

me a message

of flowers.

They come

from the woods

in pollen

and in the same

in fragrance

and the smoke

fades again.

Oh springtime!

come back!

and stay!

- William Carlos Williams
