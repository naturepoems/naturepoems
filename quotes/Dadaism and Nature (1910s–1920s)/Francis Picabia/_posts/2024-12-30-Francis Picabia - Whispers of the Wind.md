Whispers of the Wind
Hear the whispers of the wind,
a serenade that travels far;
it knows the secrets of mountains,
the laughter of rivers,
the sighs of ancient stones.

Do you hear them too?
The tales of the psyches uplifted
by breezes wrapping around
like an embrace of soft fabric;
a caress that carries stories
from one heart to another.


- Francis Picabia
