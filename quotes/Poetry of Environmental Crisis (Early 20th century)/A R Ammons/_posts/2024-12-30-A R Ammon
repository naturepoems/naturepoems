Meditation

To practice stillness, to inhale
The sweet foundation of nature’s serenade,
We cast aside our struggles, even fears,
And listen deep to the brook’s rhythm,
Hear consciousness swirl within its cadence,
In a world that sometimes feels so loud—
Find nature’s breath, within the hills, trees, rocks,
Remind ourselves of the delicate balance,
Life elegantly intertwines, nothing out of sync,
Pure connection still holds among us—
As if we are but branches, part of this fabric,
Our roots are the song sung through time.
