The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock (Excerpt)

I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
I know the voices dying with a dying fall
Beneath the music from a farther room;
So how should I presume?

And I have known the eyes already, known them allâ€”
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?

And how should I presume?

- TS Eliot
