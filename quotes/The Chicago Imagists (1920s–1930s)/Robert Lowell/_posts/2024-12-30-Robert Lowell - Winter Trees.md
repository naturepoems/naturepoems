Winter Trees
by Robert Lowell

The trees are bare,  
the sky a slate gray  
as winter’s chill descends.  
Bare branches stand stark  
but wrapped in power –  
a promise, a flicker
as the sun fades away.

And I recall the life  
in leaves, the green's return  
as time curls to embrace  
a slumber that awakens  
in an effortless sweep,  
in spring's radiant embrace.

- Robert Lowell
