Standing on a hill beyond our reach,
green, veiled by rocky face,  a spring sky opens,
where sun-storms glow gluttonous through seeds 
woven tight as each looped bar, tinkers gain.

How tangled was that leaf before it’s cast,
willed until dropped from a spark to remain,
each yarn of the entire tongue enlightens
to breathe gems along with pride over pray-unveil.

Yet ancient hound howls above this veil 
find grace in its own shadow spilled along shores,
through the deepsroad, streams running vast,
the scores start, a cradle hung low.

By shadows swooning, blue consumes, burns
like petals blossoming through edges of flight,
a cotton band suffices, breathing, broken dam turns,
till about drowning wide we float, shoring soft scents.

Nature gives a reach to touch and hold light,
at head's needs feeding womb, let the tie flow,
lodges within to deprive and dry, to adorn.
I’ll turn where each new bloom gives clearer shapes,
where stones breed and nature writes sentences full.

- Ted Hughes
