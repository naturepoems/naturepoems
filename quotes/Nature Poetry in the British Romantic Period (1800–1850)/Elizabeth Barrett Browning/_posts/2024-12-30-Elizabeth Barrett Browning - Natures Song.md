The earth is full of beauty, the sky is full of grace,
In every hour, in every place;
The light of day, the hush of night,
The glimmering stars, the moon so bright.

A gentle breeze, a fragrant flower,
The beauty of the world in every hour;
A quiet stream, a rustling leaf,
Nature’s song brings joy; it brings relief.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
