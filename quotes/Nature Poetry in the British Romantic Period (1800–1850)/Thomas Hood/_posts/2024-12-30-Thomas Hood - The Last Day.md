The Last Day  

In one last summer’s eve, we saw the golden light,  
Each leaf aglow with charges bright!  
The river’s flow as low as low could be,  
Wound through the fields like drink of sea.  

Yet glimmered last, as shadows grew,  
And lingered still when day was through —  
And thus we pass from dawn till dusk,  
For naught remains where fragrance was!

- Thomas Hood
