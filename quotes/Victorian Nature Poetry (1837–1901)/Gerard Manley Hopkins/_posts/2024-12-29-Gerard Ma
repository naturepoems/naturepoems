To a Poet

Take heart, O poet, eager at the azure height!
The things you touch are marks of tentative wheel,
Yet they stand out fair beneath the light so bright,
Where folds with graceful use of further don and seal!

Let the oil-streaked wings take you over span; 
Miss not for wonders the thrilling epiphanies,  
For only mirrors, your names will catch the damped bright fog so high!
Where those reels to gemmy flowers, retreat near warmth  of every shell!

And thus, dear, I hold—go forth in the morning mist—
Each hour speaks thus clear — for glory where dwells the air;
An echoing memory made of moments and all mixed,
So we shall see; whether songs towards their grace hold fair.

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
