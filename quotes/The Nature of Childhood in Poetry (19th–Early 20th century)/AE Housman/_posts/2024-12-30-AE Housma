Each moment lingers in the air,  
Each whisper from the fields around,  
The frozen beauty yet so fair,  
In nature's arms, true peace is found.  
The nights may darken, days may flee,  
But in the being, joy instills,  
In every tree and leaf, we see  
The heart of nature’s gentle thrills.

- AE Housman
