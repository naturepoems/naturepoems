In the embrace of the wild,
where nature whispers softly,
you are bathed in golden beams,
a heart dancing with the wind.
Each blade of grass,
each insect, each stone,
is a part of this communion,
where life unfolds, uncontained.

I wish to plant my dreams,
in this unfurling of existence,
to feel the pulse of the living,
a rhythm that connects us all.
For this earth, rich and abundant,
is where I find my solace,
a sanctuary aligned with the universe,
a celebration of our very being.

- Pablo Neruda
