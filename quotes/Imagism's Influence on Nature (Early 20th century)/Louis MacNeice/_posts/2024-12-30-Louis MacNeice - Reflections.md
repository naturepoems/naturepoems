Water, water, everywhere; 
Glimmers the reflection of the stars,
And the moon weaves together the strands;
Within my heart are gentle whispers of bars.

The river flows and sings,
Rock and moss, neither pause nor cease; 
A moment in the flooded springs,
Whispers of wonder in silences of peace.


- Louis MacNeice
