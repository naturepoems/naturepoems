Under the boughs of the dim trees
Where the deer creep softly,
I hear the rustle of the leaves,
A breath like a lover’s sigh.
The air is sweet with the scent of earth, 
And my heart feels the weight of silence.

Let the day glide past like a stream, 
For time does not haunt or bind me here;
In this calm, I find the pulse of nature, 
A fragile thread that holds the world.

- Richard Aldington
