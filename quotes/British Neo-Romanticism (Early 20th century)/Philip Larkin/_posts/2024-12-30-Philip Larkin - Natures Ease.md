To sit and watch the swaying trees,  
As time curls low beneath the boughs.  
I question not the quiet ease,  
Of natureâ€™s gift in soft-spun vows.

Beneath the buzz of laid-back bees,  
There lies a pulse most pure and clear,  
Where breath of life resounds and frees,  
All types of pains we hold so dear.

Let sunlight filter through the leaves;  
In the shadows truth starts to show.  
In tranquil moments earth believes,  
In faithful grace, lovers in tow.


- Philip Larkin
