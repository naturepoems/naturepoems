Lament for the Crickets

Underneath the echoes  
of the distant pines,  
thousands of crickets  
reveal love â€” denied.  
The dusk so bright  
as if climates of old were gone;  
a calling amplifies beside the glow  
between my ears  
attuned to whispers far,  
for a moment plays  
a tune of ruin;  
but you laugh,  
known all along,  
and the cardinals beam.

From dusk to dawn  
my soul remains the gleaner  
of that girly dance,  
descending crickets mingle  
to a notation free  
that stood not close.

- Gabriela Mistral
