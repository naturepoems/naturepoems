O, fleeting day, a blessed gift,  
In clouds adorned, I find my bliss;  
With every breeze, my passions lift,  
The fragrance of your subtle kiss.

In gardens rich with colors bright,  
Each petal soft, each leaf a crown;  
With day’s retreat comes jeweled night,  
As stars upon my dreams fall down.

--- "A Day’s End"
