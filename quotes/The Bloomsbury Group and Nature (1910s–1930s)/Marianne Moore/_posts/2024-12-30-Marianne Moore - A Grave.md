A Grave

The forest darkens as rain weight falls --
The quiet waters call to me through the trees.
Within the dark, soft blind strokes
I hear growth that in the unlighted binds,

A whispering peace cools over petals,
And invisible callers sing like winds.
Here is another root where my bones lie,
A forest claimed hushed deep and feigning.

The flowers knew the ghost of ancient poet  
Wander beyond the canopy  
And stillness sees my cranium worn  
Into the body of bruised silence.


- Marianne Moore
