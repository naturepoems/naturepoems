Inversnaid

This darksome burn, horseback brown,  
His rollrock highroad roaring down,  
In pinches and in laps runs clear,  
Among a crowd of stars, but still  
In beauty lost, our grappling deer,  
Upon your borders hold, my heart,  
And with your grace rebounding,  
Lifted, borne aloft, I roam -  
Into the wild, I dare not roam.

â€” Gerard Manley Hopkins
