The dawn breaks, painting horizons,
With shades of amber and rose,
The sky an open invitation,
To dreams yet unfurled.
Birds awaken in joyous chorus,
Welcoming the day with song,
As the sun spills light across the land,
I stand amidst this miracle,
In awe of natureâ€™s canvas,
And I, a mere witness, claim this moment, this breath.

- Arthur Rimbaud
