Amid the dappled forest glade,  
The light pours down in amber streams;  
Where leaf and float and dew cascade,  
A paragon of tranquil dreams.  
The woodland whispers life afresh,  
In harmony, design, and grace;  
For in each rustle, every flesh,  
Resides the pulse of nature’s face.  


- William Holman Hunt
