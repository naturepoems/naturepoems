In a world of trees and shadows deep,
  A sanctuary, where silence sings,
  I wander far on winding paths,
  Beneath the watchful branches’ arch.
  Each step a lullaby of peace,
  The intimate brush of moss beneath,
  Encircles my spirit,
  With the heart of nature—a sacred trust.

  - from "Sanctuary of Trees" (1912)

- Virginia Woolf
