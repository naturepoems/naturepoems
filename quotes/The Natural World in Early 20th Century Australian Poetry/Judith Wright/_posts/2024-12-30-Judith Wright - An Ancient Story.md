An Ancient Story

The earth has its sagas,
Written in stones and bones,
In the gentle curves of hills,
The sharpness of the mountains. 

Each path is a story,
Even the wind carries whispers,
And the grasses weave legends
Into the fabric of soil.

From the heart of the forest
To the edge of the sea,
An ancient story flows,
The life of the land.


- Judith Wright
