The Mother
I gave you poems,
All the words I have, and glow,
Where for birds I swooped
And shed the dew of dreams,
The morning mist settled down,
And with love was known.

I couldn’t give a child
The thrift of one gleeful ground.
I stood, I walked among
The nights through bruised
Excited ploys; traversed ardent shoals.
But you, my dear
Shall be no worded song,
No purified gift of love.

Still, I kept in sight the soft sand,
With tufts of grass,
The fragrances to hold,
The joys and glories of young unfolding.
Content enough in my heart,
Where the sun-of-it all shall break,
With birth-stones falling
Among the living leaf; and love.
Spectacle seeks the soft entwined.
After all, thought can draw the line of a freeman. 

With secrets now visible,
All refugees shall recollect,
The buried cusp holds none,<br>
For you have partook in rest, my son.

- Gwendolyn Brooks
