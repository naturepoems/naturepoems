A Spirit of Nature

From the earth a meteor flies,
And a shadow of the skyâ€”
Like a blaze of light that dies
On the hill-tops near and nigh.
'Tis the summer day of cheer,
When the sun does brightly glow;
At the last I find it clear,
'Twas a spirit of the snow.

Oh, my heart is light and free,
And my soul on wings of air!
In the dappled light I see
Rare creations everywhere.
The sunbeams drown the meads,
While in shadows soft I roam,
Thinks I, Where no herdsman leads,
There alone I have my home.

- John Burroughs
