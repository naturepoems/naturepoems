On a Day of Winter, the Skies are Blue 
There is a loveliness that naught can wed 
Beyond the heart's most silent, still design, 
Enveloping the world with pristine lines— 
The soft and slow percussion of the dead, 
Yet, o’er the sod, the grace of life still bred. 
Each glance of sun, each fleeting tinge of vine 
Will speak while winds in whispers intertwine 
And every painted leaf sings of the spread 
Of life anew, beneath the winter queen. 
Listen, then, to nature's gentle sigh; 
Feel the pulse of life in frozen scene— 
The solitude of winter’s chill—alive!

- John Keats
