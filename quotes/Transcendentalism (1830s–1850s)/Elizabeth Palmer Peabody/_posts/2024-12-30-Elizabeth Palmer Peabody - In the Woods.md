In the Woods

The sunlight ripens the dew,
And through the trees,
O’er the mossy roots,
We hear the sweet whispers;
The brook flows,
And the hungry bees,
Gathering sweet flowers from every shade,
Make the song of summer,
Under the trees.

I love the mighty woods,
They open their arms,
To the blue of the sky,
And emerald of grass,
Keep me that I shall not fade,
Like the flower—but leave away, 
With the pluck and sweetness,
To hold nature in me.

- Elizabeth Palmer Peabody
