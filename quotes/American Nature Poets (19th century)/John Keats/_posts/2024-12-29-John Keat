To my brothers
 
Take my hand, my dear, the day was warm and sweet,
Bring forth for us the final peach we grew
Upon golden boughs, bleached up to the sky's off hue;
And breathe, my friend, for I find rest beneath those feet.  

All garden's budding and as wild as till, 
Fill me to whom warmth shall keep us safe yet go
And place yon far sound and soften tales we know;
Shall time be here for honest heart be still?.

So I, into these worlds of nature shall find sighs,
Take me from this hill and shade!—once all ceased,
Yonder blooming charm, shall ever be deceived.
For pine shall catch; and dull return must rise.

And can I ask thee but a smiling heart, my own,
To grace my silent road, to lead by shade so fine—  
Since quietly yet remain the stillness of moon and chill?
All glimmer someday shall let forgetting lean;
My brothers yield, in tender sighs of folds profound,
Our lives entwined—till light shall ever find good yields,
And warming air to walk us far, each voice unknown.


- John Keats
