A winding path through the forest unfolds,
Inviting my heart where adventure mold.
Each step a connection, a bond with the earth,
In this journey of life, I witness rebirth.

With every rustle, a tale comes alive,
In the dance of the wild, my soul learns to thrive.
As the sun casts its glow and the moon starts to rise,
In the arms of the forest, I find my goodbyes.
