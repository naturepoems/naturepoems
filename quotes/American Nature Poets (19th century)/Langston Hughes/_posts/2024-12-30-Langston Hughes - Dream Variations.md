Dream Variations
To fling my arms wide
In the face of the sun,
Dance! Whirl!
Whirl!
Till the quick day is done.

Rest at cool evening...
Beneath a tall tree
(Throwing shade over me)
Iâ€™ll be a poet...

In the night, I dream of arms
And all the stars shining bright.
A place where flowers bloom,
And the birds are heard in flight.

- Langston Hughes
