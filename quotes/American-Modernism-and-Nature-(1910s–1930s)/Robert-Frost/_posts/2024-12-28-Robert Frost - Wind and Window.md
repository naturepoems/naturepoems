Wind and Window Flower
Lover’s quarrel, I have been alone.
I am not with you, what have I known?
The stars are obscured with changing clouds,
The night is flung like a tale of shrouds.
Love the moon like I love the stars,
How she hovers like the sun among our scars.

Let the wind blow soft as it may,
While leaves tangle down and memories sway,
Fresh breath upon the window pane,
Will lead the flowing murmur of rain.

- Robert Frost
