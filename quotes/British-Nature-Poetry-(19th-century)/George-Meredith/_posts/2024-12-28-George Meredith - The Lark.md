The Lark Ascending

    E'er then the heart should break,
    O lark, I stand and wait,
    To hear thee lift thy voice,
    And raise me up from fate.

    A streak of blue, a glimmer,
    A flash of golden light,
    Thy song doth mirror heaven;
    My spirit takes its flight.

    O glorious lark! thy heart,
    Doth soar beyond the sun,
    With thee I weave the air,
    In rapture, we are one.

- George Meredith
