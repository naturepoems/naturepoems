now the evening makes me feel
   light as a song,
               time poses
        and says solemn homeward,
 as you stride - away,
   like curtains of movement;
tight as the stars do hang 
in thoughtful capping  
   air of twilightâ€™s tasks,
light in of breath close,
   wrap the rain.

- ee cummings
