At Night

It is a simple world,

and the songs amaze

and secret sounds

up into the sun.

Between the flowers,

the clouds play!

Something just swells

that we don’t claim,

but lay soft Harry,

and round and out

the finger blows

shimmering away beyond.

The oar shall be

there at dawn

for all the hidden rays.

Can you be awake
to the stranger’s hand?

Oh gentle night!

- William Carlos Williams
