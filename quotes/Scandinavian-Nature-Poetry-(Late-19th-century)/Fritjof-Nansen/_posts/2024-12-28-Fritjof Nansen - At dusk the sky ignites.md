At dusk, the sky ignites,  
A canvas of purples and gold,  
As the day surrenders  
To the calm of twilight,  
And the hush of stars  
Begins to illuminate the night.

The mountains stand like sentinels,  
Silhouetted against the dying light,  
And in the cool embrace of evening,  
A breeze stirs softly,  
Carrying the scent of earth and pine,  
A reminder of the day that was,  
The life that thrives beneath the stars.

In the stillness, I find peace,  
Cradled in natureâ€™s arms,  
As the world breathes deeply,  
And the melody of crickets  
Begins its soothing song,  
A lullaby for hearts  
That yearn for the wild.

- Fritjof Nansen
