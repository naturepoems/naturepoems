The gentle fall of summer rain,  
Kisses the parched and thirsty ground,  
Each droplet sings a lullaby,  
To hear the earth’s sweet, soothing sound.  
Petals lift to greet the sky,  
Awakening dreams that lie in wait,  
And in this moment, life returns,  
As nature holds us, and we create.

- Ellen Ballance
