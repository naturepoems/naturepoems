Down by the brook, where wildflowers grow,
And daisies bloom in sunlit glow,
Life flows gently, a tranquil stream,
Reflecting all that we could dream.

The dragonflies flit through the air,
While butterflies dance without a care;
In this still place, we find our peace,
And all our troubles seem to cease.


- W H Auden
