quote: "The solitary bee, 
drone and superficial, 
tries to understand rocks, 
but only the lichen lives here, 
a thin blue line threading unfocused shadows./ 
To be alone, but not lonely, 
to not live away from 
a life being lived./ 
A flower-like snare, 
catching the sun by day, 
yet only bird song at dusk."

The solitary bee, 
drone and superficial, 
tries to understand rocks, 
but only the lichen lives here, 
a thin blue line threading unfocused shadows./ 
To be alone, but not lonely, 
to not live away from 
a life being lived./ 
A flower-like snare, 
catching the sun by day, 
yet only bird song at dusk.

- Marianne Moore
