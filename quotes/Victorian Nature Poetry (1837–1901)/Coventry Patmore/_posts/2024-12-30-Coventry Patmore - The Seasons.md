The Seasons

I. Spring

Incited by the moisture of the night,  
The stir of air, the stir of light,  
The breath of water, dew, and steam,
  
I hear the voice of nature call,  
And promises of flowering  
Through every tree and living thing.  

   Each bud, like hope, lies folded  
And waits the spring’s awakening;  
The grass and flowers begin to wake,  
To thrust aside the earth that lies  
Like a vast scarf, about their heads.  

   The leaves that hide the birds  
Are coming to the branches.  
Well shall our hearts be light,  
And, in the softening air,  
All things shall be born anew.  

II. Summer

In radiant joy the hours go by,  
With the nature of delight  
Beneath summer’s brilliant sky,  
   Illuminating green and gold.  
Each flower is a loud delight  
From every bough a song is rolled.
 
   A gentle breeze caresses me,  
Half swathed in mist, half clear,  
Where trees bend low, and dewdrops sparkle,  
Entwined about each burning ray;  
Oh the solemn joy in every day!  

III. Autumn

Whilst fingers shake the laden boughs of trees,  
Brushing autumn’s boon around,  
The glories of the yellowed leaves,
  Each whisper of the passing breeze  
Is like soft music without sound,  
For lo, the end is near,  
And all must change and fade.

IV. Winter

Yet where the garlands hang, full and bright,  
And the dead save its burdening weight,  
Through frost and fog, beneath the moon’s pale light,  
The boughs are bent, and in joyous sorrow waited.  
The splendor of the summer memory,  
In winter’s arms anew, shall be our bliss.
