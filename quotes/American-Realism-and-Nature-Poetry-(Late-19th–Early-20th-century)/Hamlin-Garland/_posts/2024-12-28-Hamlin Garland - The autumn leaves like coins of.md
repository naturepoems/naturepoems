The autumn leaves, like coins of gold,
Fall gently down to kiss the ground,
A tapestry of tales retold,
As seasons turn, new joys are found.
In nature's cycle, life goes on,
With each caress of winter's breath,
And spring anew, the earth’s best song,
To dance the dance that conquers death.

- Hamlin Garland
