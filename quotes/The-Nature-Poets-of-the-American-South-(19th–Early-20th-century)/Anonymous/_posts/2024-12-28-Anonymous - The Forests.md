The Forest's Embrace

In twilight’s glow, the forest stands,  
A sentinel of whispering trees;  
Where shadows dance on soft, cool sands,  
And echoing the nightingale's pleas.  

With every rustle, every sigh,  
The ancient woods breathe tales of old;  
Their secrets hidden, as time flies,  
In nature’s book, forever told.
