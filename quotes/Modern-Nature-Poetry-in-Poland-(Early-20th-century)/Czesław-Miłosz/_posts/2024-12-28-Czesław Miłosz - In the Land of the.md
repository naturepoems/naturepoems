In the Land of the Gods

In the land of the gods,
where every mountain sings,
where the rivers weave tales
through the valleys, deep and wide,
I walk,
listening to the echoes of eternity.

The trees hold wisdom,
bending with the winds,
pulling me close,
breathing life into silence,
as the world spirals on,
in a dance of shadows and light.

- Czesław Miłosz
