THE MOTHER OF ALL NATURE

Nature is so strong, whole, and simple,
That is is safe to admit she cannot die, —

The flower must fade, the blade go down,
The snail must die, the thrush must cease to sing,
The sun must drop out of the sky—

Yet, as I stand and think,
The vast and intricate order of it,
The seasons and the cycles,
Tells me the whole cannot perish,
And I wonder if that is God’s greatest gift to me.


- Edna Saint Vincent Millay
