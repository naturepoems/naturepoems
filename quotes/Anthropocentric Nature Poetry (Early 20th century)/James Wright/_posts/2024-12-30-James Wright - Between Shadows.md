Between shadow and sunlight
There lies the beauty of being,
A path woven through the forest,
Where trees stretch their branches wide,
Offering their quiet embrace, as if to say:
“You are not alone.”
Here, nestled in the silence,
I find my heart speaking softly,
Each rustling leaf a reminder,
Each footstep a connection,
To the earth, to the stories beneath,
Where roots entwine like destinies,
Where the fragrance of pine lifts my spirit,
A promise—there is always a way back
To the simplicity of nature, still alive.

— "Between Shadows"

- James Wright
