Waltzing Matilda
Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong,
Under the shade of a coolibah tree,
And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled,
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me.

Down came a jumbuck to drink at the billabong,
Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee,
And he sang as he stuffed that jumbuck in his tucker bag,
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me.

- AB Paterson Banjo Paterson
