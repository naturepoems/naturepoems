The Waterfall

A waterfall sings,
Veiling the rocks with white lace,
A gentle roar of spirit
That rumbles beneath the air.

It tumbles down joyfully,
As if escaping the chains of time,
Flooding the silence with echoes
That will never die out.

Glimmering in sunlight,
Each drop is a wish,
Falling like dreams,
Imagined and now alive.


- Jorge Luis Borges
