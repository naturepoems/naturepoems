Springtime in the Sierra

The sun bursts forth with a radiant glow,  
Rivers swirl with laughter, cascades refrain;  
In the embrace of the meadows, beauty does flow,  
With wildflowers blooming, a colorful chain.

Ice melts away, and the joyous streams dance,  
Echoes of life resound, with each little leap;  
In valleys, through mountains—a wondrous romance,  
Where blissful horizons stretch vast and deep.

Let us rejoice in the splendor of spring,  
For nature awakens, with love at her core;  
In the Sierra’s arms, our hearts take wing,  
In this sacred season, forever explore.
