On the mountain's highest crest,
Where the sky kisses earth's embrace,
Every weary soul finds rest,
In the beauty of this sacred space.

Here the winds sing tales of old,
Carrying dreams on dove's swift flight,
In the heart, courage takes hold,
Challenges bloom in the heart's light.

- Jean Blewett
