Spring  

Awake! arise! for summer's gone;  
Go, seek the vale! The flowers are shrunk —  
The alders broken and fallen prostrate;  
All things are fading! Lament this hour!  

The sun plays peep, behind each tree;  
The dew-drops bathed in love, refine;  
Emerging greens, gay with energy,  
Strain upward, toward a higher line!  

The streams in rippling lull are deep,  
Where silent worlds instill;  
Life glimmers here, beneath the sweep,  
Of nature's voice so still.  

My heart has found a fixed repose;  
In every nook I see  
Those sights, which every tale well knows;  
O grand simplicity!

- William Hazlitt
