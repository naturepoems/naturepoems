Into the Woods

Into the woods, where shadows play,
Where echoes roam and secrets dwell,
Our hearts like starlight learn to sway,
In timeless trance, where spirits tell.

With every breeze, the whispers call,
A symphony in twilight’s gleam,
We walk, entwined, we hold it all,
In the embrace of nature’s dream.


- Robert Graves
