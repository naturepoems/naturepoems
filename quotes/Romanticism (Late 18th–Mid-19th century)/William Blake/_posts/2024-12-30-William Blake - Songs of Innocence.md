Songs of Innocence

Piping down the valleys wild,  
Piping songs of pleasant glee,  
On a cloud, I saw a child,  
And he laughing said to me:

‘Pipe a song about a Lamb!’  
So I piped with merry cheer.  
‘Piper, pipe that song again;  
So I piped: he wept to hear.

Drop thy pipe, thy piper’s crown;  
I have lost my sheep,’ he said.  
‘I can’t keep my pipes from sounding,  
For I’m lost in thought instead.’


- William Blake
