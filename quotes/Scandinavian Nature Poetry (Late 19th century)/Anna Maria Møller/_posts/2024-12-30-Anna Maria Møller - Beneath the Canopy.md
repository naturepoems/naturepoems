Beneath the Canopy

In the forest's heart, a world unknown,
Where light breaks through in gentle tone,
Leaves converse in whispers low,
In this temple, nature’s glow.

Moss carpets the ground in velvet grace,
With every step, we find our place,
The fragrance of earth, the songs of birds,
In every whisper, the heart is stirred.

The canopies weave tales of old,
In branches wear a cloak of gold,
With every breath, the wild we savor,
In nature’s arms, we find our favor.


- Anna Maria Møller
