Whispers of the Wind

The wind it whispers through the trees,
With tales of lands both near and far,
It carries songs upon the breeze,
A lullaby beneath the stars.

In every gust, a voice is heard,
It speaks of earth, of sky, of sea,
In natureâ€™s breath, our hearts are stirred,
To roam the wild, to simply be.


- James McAuley
