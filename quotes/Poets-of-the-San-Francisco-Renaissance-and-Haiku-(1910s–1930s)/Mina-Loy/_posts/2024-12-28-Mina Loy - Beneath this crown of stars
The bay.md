The bay"

author: Mina Loy
quote: "Beneath this crown of stars,
The bay sleeps with all its dreams,
Reflecting the waltz of passing clouds,
Scooped up as vessels of thought,
Glistening, they arc over water,
Illuminating visions,
Each ripple whispers tales unheard,
Nature's saga unfolds,
Crickets chirp stories of twilight, 
Breath of dusk holding close."

Beneath this crown of stars,
The bay sleeps with all its dreams,
Reflecting the waltz of passing clouds,
Scooped up as vessels of thought,
Glistening, they arc over water,
Illuminating visions,
Each ripple whispers tales unheard,
Nature's saga unfolds,
Crickets chirp stories of twilight, 
Breath of dusk holding close.

- Mina Loy
