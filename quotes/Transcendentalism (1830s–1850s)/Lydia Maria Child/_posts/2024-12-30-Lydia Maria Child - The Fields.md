THE FIELDS

Look at the fields, so broad and wide,
Their bounty every season lends,
With health in every rounded shape,
And love that nature's path extends.

The golden grain in sunlight sways,
The flowers weave a fragrant air,
Unfurling petals, vibrant hues,
The quiet promise freely shared.

Among these bounteous fields we sigh,
With gratitude that fills the heart,
For all of nature’s gifts bestowed,
A sacred life, an art.


- Lydia Maria Child
