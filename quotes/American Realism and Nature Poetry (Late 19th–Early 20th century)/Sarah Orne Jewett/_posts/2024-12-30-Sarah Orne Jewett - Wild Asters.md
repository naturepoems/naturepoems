Wild Asters

The goldenrod is yellow, 
The corn's in the shock; 
The sky is overcast, 
And the dark clouds flock.
The leaves of the trees are swaying, 
The best of the shows are yet to come: 
Ah! The woods are aflame 
As the wild asters bloom.
Let me go whispering in the green,
'The air is sweet, come out to play;'
With me on a sun-sprinkled bank 
And feel the softening wind's sway.

The sassafras spell of autumn 
Is sweet to the heart that knows; 
And thoughts of the summer rain 
Bring tender loving shows. 
Then walk in the wild with me, 
And let us go by the brook—  
See how the asters bend 
Among the trees where we look!

- Sarah Orne Jewett
