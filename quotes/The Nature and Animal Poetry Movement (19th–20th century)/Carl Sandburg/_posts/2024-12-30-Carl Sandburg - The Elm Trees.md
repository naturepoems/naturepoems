In the nighttime, the elm trees know,
their leaves stretch and bend low,
weaving gold between fingers,
shadows slanting over paths,
quiet—and only whispers know.

Among the green, call the sun
where days will dance again,
between spaces of air,
a soft light,  
a deep sea,  
a memory;  
where that sweet sadness breathes.

- Carl Sandburg
