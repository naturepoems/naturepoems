Oh, the songbirds trilling all the day,
With sweet notes ringing in the air,
They fill my heart in a glorious way,
As I linger on in the world so rare.

Each feathered friend with a wisp of grace,
Flits through branches, here and there,
Their melodies sweeten this sacred place,
And life, it seems, is nothing but care.

They share a secret with the trees,
And beckon me to join the throng,
In their chorale of harmonious ease,
Where in the bushes, life feels so strong.
