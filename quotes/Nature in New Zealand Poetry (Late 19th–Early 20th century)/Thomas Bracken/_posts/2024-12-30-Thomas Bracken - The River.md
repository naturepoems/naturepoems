THE RIVER

There’s a river that flows through the heart of the land,
A silver thread twining, a nature’s hand;
It dances with laughter in the warm sun’s ray,
And whispers sweet secrets to the world each day.

In the springtime it rushes, with joy unconfined,
While the flowers lean down to their reflections kind;
And the hills watch in silence, with joy to behold,
The beauty of movement, with splashes of gold.

In the autumn it wanders so slow and serene,
A mirror of colors, of the rich and the green;
And the leaves, they drift gently upon its breast,
In a lullaby soothing, where peace is a guest.

O river of life, with your currents you lead,
Through valleys, through cities, you’re Nature’s own creed;
As long as you flow, in your ceaseless embrace,
You’ll carry our dreams to a far sweeter place.

- Thomas Bracken
