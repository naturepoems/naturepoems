Let me walk with you,
In the golden embrace
Of dawn gently breaking,
The sun’s radiant face,
As birds fill the silence,
In joyful flight sing,
And the world pulls me close,
With the gifts nature brings.

Through valleys and meadows,
Beyond mountains’ great size,
Each step is a gift,
And beneath endless skies,
Holding hands with the Earth,
I find solace and grace,
For in every moment,
Life's sweetened embrace.

- Henry David Thoreau
