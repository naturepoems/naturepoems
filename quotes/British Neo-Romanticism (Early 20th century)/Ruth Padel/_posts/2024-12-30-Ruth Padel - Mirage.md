Mirage
The desert stretches infinite,  
a pulse of heat shimmering,  
where mirages dance in the distance,  
a whimsical play of light and shade.

Sand slips beneath my feet,  
each grain a whisper of time,  
where shadows weave their secrets,  
curled in the arms of the ancients.

I long to reach the horizon,  
but know the true journey is inward,  
as I embrace the stillness within,  
a refuge in the endless expanse.

- Ruth Padel
