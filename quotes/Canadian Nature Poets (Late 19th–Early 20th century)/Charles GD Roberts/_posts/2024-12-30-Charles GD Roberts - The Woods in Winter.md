The Woods in Winter

When winter’s cloak, so still and white,  
  Enfolds the trees in peace,  
I wander through a world so bright,  
  Where quiet never ceases.  
With every step a crunch of snow,  
  A song beneath my feet,  
And icicles in shimmering rows  
  Are nature’s bright retreat.

The boughs hang low, adorned in frost,  
  Like jewels upon a crown,  
As silence deepens, and I pause  
  To savor winter’s gown.  
The woods, a realm of still repose,  
  Are cloistered from the din,  
And in my heart a warmth still grows,  
  As solace dwells within.

O winter woods, with time so slow,  
  You whisper soft and light,  
And wrap my weary soul in grace,  
  Through every starry night.  
So here I’ll dwell, embraced by peace,  
  While nature sings her hymn,  
In winter’s arms I find release  
  To let the heart grow dim.

- Charles GD Roberts
