A Bird came down the Walk –  
He did not know I saw –  
He bit an Angle-Worm in halves  
And ate the fellow, raw –  

And then he drank a Dew  
From a convenient Grass –  
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall  
To let a Beetle pass –  

He glanced with rapid Eyes  
That hurried all abroad –  
They looked like frightened Beads, I thought –  
He stirred his Velvet Head –  

Like one in danger, Cautious,  
I offered him a Crumb –  
And he unrolled his feathers  
And rode him softer Home –  

Than Oars divide the Ocean,  
Too silver for a seam –  
Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon,  
Leap, plashless as they swim –  

—Emily Dickinson
