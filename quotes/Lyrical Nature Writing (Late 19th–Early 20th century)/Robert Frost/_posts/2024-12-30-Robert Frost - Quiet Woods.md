In the middle of the woods
There’s a place of quiet peace,
Where shadows stretch and deepen,
And life seems but a soft release.

The pines sway gently overhead,
As whispers float upon the breeze;
And though our paths may take us far,
This woodland cradle holds such ease.

Here time seems nothing—it stands still,
The heartbeat slows, the mind sets free;
To wander here is to reside
In nature’s grand simplicity.

Though seasons change and days grow long,
The spirit yearns to return near
To those tranquil woods where branches sing
Of solace, love, and ancient cheer.

- Robert Frost
