Here lie I, drenched in the perfume of flowers,
Amongst sunlight and shade and soft summer hours,
In the deep embrace of golden glades,
Where time flows along like the water cascades.

The air is filled with a sweet and fresh aroma,
While all the bright colors of nature are in bloom,
Here, there is but joy where life unfurls,
In the embrace of nature, my heart whirls.
When I walk among the boughs with sweet delight,
And let the sun gather me in soft light.

See how the petals hang in their skirts,
A dance of grace in which each flower flirts.
O, heart of mine, drink deep this art untold,
In a world of wonder, forever bold.

- John Keats
