The Peace of Wild Things

I go among the trees and sit still.
All my listenings are in the sacred dark.

I cannot imagine what’s behind this door
and so I take the time to sit still,

because now the children can play
under the trees or break open the tiny buds.

And I close my eyes to the wild things around me,
whispering sleep and peace,

and the dream that I hold.

Until I too want to rise,
become wild, be part of the whisper.
