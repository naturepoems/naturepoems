In a Far Country

From the uncivilized wilds to the dreams of gold, he ventured into realms that whispered of freedom but echoed with the cries of the lost.
Nature undisturbed enveloped him, fierce as the north wind, cradling his form in beauty and terror, sacred in its wildness and rawness, yet perilously indifferent to the struggles of men.

- Jack London
