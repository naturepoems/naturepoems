Birches
When I see birches bend to left and right
Across the lines of straighter, darker trees,
I like to think some boy's been swinging them.
But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.
Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them
Loaded with icy hammers, bending branches down
To stay. That is what the game is, but I’d rather
See their slender tops ascending in the sky
Than have them all wither down to the ground.

So I hold on to my childhood, but I do not let it
Take me over. One minute I was one of them,
Then I slipped back to earth.

Earth’s the one thing we make our own, and it’s easy
Just as it’s easy to go up and go right on.
Why not walk into a tree or a clay plain?
Just walk right into the heart of what you want to say!

- Robert Frost
