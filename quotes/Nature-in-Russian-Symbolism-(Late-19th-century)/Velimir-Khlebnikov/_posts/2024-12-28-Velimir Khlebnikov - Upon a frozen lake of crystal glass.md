Upon a frozen lake of crystal glass,  
the world feels wrapped in embrace,  
the trees adorned in white garments,  
a silent celebration of winter's grace.  

In this frigid beauty, hearts find warmth,  
each breath a fog in the chilled air,  
and as nature sleeps, dreams are born,  
a promise of spring in the quiet prayer.

- Velimir Khlebnikov
