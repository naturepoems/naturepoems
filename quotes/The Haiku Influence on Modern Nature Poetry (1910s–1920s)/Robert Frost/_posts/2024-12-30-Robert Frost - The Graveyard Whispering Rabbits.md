In a disused graveyard in the town of York,
I found where rabbits had come to play.
They leaped across a single stone,
Marked with the name of one long-hearted,
Whose life of wildness now lay still,
Starved out in the open, without theft or toil.

Underneath the changing skies,
I watched their moves, their bounce and styles,
Excited little lives of velvet gray,
On the grave of manfully penned over,
In stark ribbings, once painted bones.

I could have closed my eyes in envy,
But a harmony arose and sang,
The urge to sway and leap with play,
And so at dusk the tombs played me.
And I a gallivant of light and shade.

- Robert Frost
