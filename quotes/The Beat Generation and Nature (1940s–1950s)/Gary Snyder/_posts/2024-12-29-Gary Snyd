Beneath the vast expanse,
Where clouds drift lazily by,
I dance with the wind, 
And it carries my dreams,
To the mountain tops and beyond,
The horizon painted with hope,
As I wander this path of existence, 
The road unwinding beneath my feet,
Nature shares her wisdom, 
And I embrace her unending beauty.

- Gary Snyder
