The Lark Ascending

O high-ho! To the lark, this is the day  
  The music of creation, in the eternal ways  
Sings its song of height, in calm and shade:  
  O soaring, where the heavens appear in glade!  
For surely thine art coded into heaven’s way,  
  This opening of the light where you sway!

- George Meredith
