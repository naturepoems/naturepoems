The Goldfinch

In the blue sea there is a bird,
A goldfinch, in the sea's vastness,
It climbs the airy heights,
Whirling in raptures of pure bliss.

It sings and flutters gaily,
In a melody so tender and sweet,
And the waves are caressing,
As if the sea echoes the tune's heartbeat.

The goldfinch darts, it darts and sways,
Caught in the sunlight's warm embrace,
A spirit born from nature's grace,
In its talons, the sky's bright rays.

Oh, fleeting wonder of the sea,
Yet remained within the heart,
Forever singing free and pure,
A melody that won't depart.

â€“ Nikolai Gumilyov
