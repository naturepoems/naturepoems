The Windhover

I caught this morning midday molten gold
In the slaughtered sunlight, and in the haze of this huge day,  
A bird hung still; unwounded, a falcon, of course,  
Over the wild, mature, soaring, sky; no longer cold.  
But I love the feel of prairies in this whirring sun,  
And the battle cry of spirits, struggling just out of sight.

I do not stand still but rise, unbent, between earth and heaven,
Falling in the incomplete grips of this wind, I fly.

â€” Gerard Manley Hopkins
