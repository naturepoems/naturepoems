The Sea-Limits

So we shall have ere long a wave,  
A moon above that smiles as bright;  
He stays undrowned yet, nor had  
Eclipsed the drift with sunk cloud;  
The winds meanwhile are bards, forgive  
The lonely storm unsealed;  
And there the paths of yesterday  
Climbing steep above is revealed.  

To look with winding joy, as stays,  
For while without is precious firm,  
Fair ways of sunken seasons sway;  
They take their birth of hope in dreams,  
To hear the glad chime of labour loud;  
Betwixt the feet in living seams  
Now roams a flight, intense and proud.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
