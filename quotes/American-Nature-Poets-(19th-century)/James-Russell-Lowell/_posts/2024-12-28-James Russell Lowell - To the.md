To the Dandelion
Dear common flower, that growest wild,
   Near to the hearts of men,
   The fairest thing that greets the eye
   In all our broad domain!

   I love to see your cheerful oath,
   And mark your golden hue,
   And find in you the spring's delight,
   A cup of heaven's dew.


- James Russell Lowell
