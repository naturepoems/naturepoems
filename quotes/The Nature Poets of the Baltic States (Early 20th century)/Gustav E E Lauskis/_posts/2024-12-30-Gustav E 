Nature's Whisper
In the quiet of dawn, nature's whisper begins,
With the soft swell of life, the day finally wins.
Birds greet the morning, their melody sweet,
As the world awakens, my heart skips a beat.

The rustle of leaves, the sigh of the trees,
Each sound a reminder, of beauty that frees.
In natureâ€™s embrace, where the spirit can soar,
I find my truth, and I long for no more.


- Gustav E E Lauskis
