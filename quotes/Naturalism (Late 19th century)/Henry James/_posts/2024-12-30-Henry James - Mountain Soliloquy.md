Among the peaks, where eagles soar,
The mountain's heart beats, forevermore.
Its craggy ridges, ancient lore,
Echo tales of those who swore.

To find the truth in the rocks and stone,
To climb and conquer, to be alone.
Yet in that solitude, wisdom is found,
Natureâ€™s silence, a sacred ground.


- Henry James
