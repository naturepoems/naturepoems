Autumn

                    There’s a breath of autumn’s glow,
                    On the trees that sway and bow,
                    A rustle in the golden leaves,
                    A crisp embrace that weaves and cleaves.
                    
                    The fields are turning, colored bright,
                    Beneath the skies, the fading light,
                    This harvest time, as bounty swells,
                    With whispered tales in chamomile bells.
                    
                    Each tree’s adorned with richness rare,
                    In Nature's glad and gentle care,
                    O let the autumn’s song resound,
                    In heart and earth, forever found.
