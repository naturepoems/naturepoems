A glittering sheen of morning dew,
On petals laced with the dawn’s view,
In the garden movement, shadows play,
Awakening visions where thoughts stray.

The sparrows flit in fierce delight,
Wings of freedom taking flight;
In the realm where nature’s breath,
Tells of life, and love, and death.


- Philip Lamantia
