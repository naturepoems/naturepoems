The Wind

The wind, unbridled and untamed,
Blows free across the fields,
Its whispers call to the wildness
That stirs within the heart.
It fills the sails of my soul,
Driving it forth into the unknown,
Where the sun-kissed beaches call,
And the horizon stretches afar.

It howls through the naked trees,
Filling their branches with song,
The symphony of the earth,
Echoing in the caves of my silence,
And in the whispers of the flowers,
Opening their petals to greet
This masterful force that knows no bounds,
And I turn my face to the elements,
And breathe deep of the freedom you offer.

- D H Lawrence
