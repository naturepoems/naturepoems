The Silence of Water

In the shade of the blue trees,  
The hush of a lake lies still,  
Where dreams take care of their thoughts;  
You wait for the hush and the wind,  
To dream of your building shadows;  
Then the stillness and wide blue water  
Swirl together, threatened by the light!  
Of natureâ€™s sorrows, a quiet flow  
Makes a song across the row;  
Oh, the silence of water!  
The sound, and wait, and rise!

- Lesbia Harford
