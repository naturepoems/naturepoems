The Straw

I love spring most
Of all the seasons,
When earth is soft and
The air is breezy.
Rolling out the straw,
Waking fields of green,
Another year approaches.

The light shifting through gardens,
Chasing long lazy rays,
Turns our eyes back
From reluctance and post,
A bloom from out the harvest's hope.


- Gwendolyn Brooks
