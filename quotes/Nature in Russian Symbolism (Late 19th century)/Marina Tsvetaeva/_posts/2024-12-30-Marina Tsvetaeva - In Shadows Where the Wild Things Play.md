In shadows where the wild things play,
Beneath the boughs of ancient trees,
The breath of nature weaves its song,
A melody that brings me ease.
Each rustling leaf tells tales of time,
Of spirits dwelling in the shade,
In the heart of the forest’s rhythm,
Life’s halcyon serenade.
Here I find my solace waiting,
As the night enfolds the earth,
In the pulse of each soft whisper,
I discover endless worth.

- Marina Tsvetaeva
