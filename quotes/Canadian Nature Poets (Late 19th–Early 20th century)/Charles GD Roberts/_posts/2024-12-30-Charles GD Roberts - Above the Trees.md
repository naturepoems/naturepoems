Above the Trees

Above the trees, up high and bold,  
  The golden sun spills light,  
That dances on the dewy leaves,  
  In a brilliant, warm delight.  
The intimate whisper of the boughs,  
  And the sighing of the pines,  
A symphony of wildest grace,  
  In a world that sun defines.

The shadows play, the breezes hum,  
  The flowers wake and breathe;  
And as the mountain's pulse beats strong  
  All nature finds reprieve.  
So I, in wonder, feel the thrill,  
  Of beauty pure as essence,  
Awake to light, a wish fulfilled,  
  In a love beyond all presence.

- Charles GD Roberts
