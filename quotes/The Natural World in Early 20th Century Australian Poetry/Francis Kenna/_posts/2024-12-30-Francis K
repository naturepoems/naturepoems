The Hills Are Calling

The hills are calling, come away,
Into the wild embrace,
Where every path and winding trail,
Leads to nature’s sacred space.

With wildflowers in vibrant bloom,
And skies of azure hue,
The heartbeat of the earth resounds,
In melodies so true.

Let’s wander far from city’s rush,
Where silence reigns supreme,
In the arms of ancient mountains,
We can find our timeless dream.

So heed the hills, their gentle call,
With each step, feel the thrill,
For in the heart of nature's grace,
We'll find our spirits still.

- Francis Kenna
