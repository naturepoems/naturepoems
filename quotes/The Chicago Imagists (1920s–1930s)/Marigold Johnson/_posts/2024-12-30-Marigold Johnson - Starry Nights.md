Starry Nights

Under a blanket of velvet sky,
The stars emerge, a jeweled sea,
They sprinkle dreams, they wave goodbye,
To daylight’s hold, to memory.

In silver glows, the cosmos speaks,
Of wonders vast, of time and space,
In each small spark, the heart seeks,
Its rightful place in the universe’s grace.

- Marigold Johnson
