quote: "The River Stone
So smooth, the river stone lies down,
Worn by waters, carved by time,
A vessel of memories, of the rush and flow,
Reflecting the sky, caught in stillness exalted."

The River Stone
So smooth, the river stone lies down,
Worn by waters, carved by time,
A vessel of memories, of the rush and flow,
Reflecting the sky, caught in stillness exalted.

- Francis Ponge
