O Thou who, with the aetherial ray,
Thy light o’er nature dost diffuse,
Guide my soul while it walks the way—  
Let me trace thy flights,  
In solitude and silence sweet,
In the grove or by the brook,
Where the bees their honey meet,  
And the nightingale wakes our loneliest nook.

- Mary Wollstonecraft
