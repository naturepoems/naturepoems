Misty Morning
Upon the hills, where fog does creep,
The dawn awakens with a sigh;
In muffled hues, the world in sleep,
Is wrapped in silence, soft and shy.

Yet in this veil of hushed embrace,
The sun breaks through with golden ray;
And natureâ€™s voice, with gentle grace,
Calls forth the day, in bright array.

- Ilya Ehrenburg
