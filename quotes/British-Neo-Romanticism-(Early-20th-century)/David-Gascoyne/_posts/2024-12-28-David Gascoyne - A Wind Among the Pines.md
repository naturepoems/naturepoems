A Wind Among the Pines  
Her face lost  
Among the wavering limbs,  
And the moonlight  
Cascading like water,  
Gentle as the breath  
Of forgotten dreams—  
A wind among the pines.  

She offers her hand  
To the child of the night,  
And they dance  
On the dew-drenched grass,  
Where the tall blades bend,  
Like hopes made manifest  
Under her care.  

So she carries the past,  
Each flutter of leaves  
An echo, a sigh—  
And the stars, they twinkle,  
Lost in the embrace  
Of the timeless woods.

- David Gascoyne
