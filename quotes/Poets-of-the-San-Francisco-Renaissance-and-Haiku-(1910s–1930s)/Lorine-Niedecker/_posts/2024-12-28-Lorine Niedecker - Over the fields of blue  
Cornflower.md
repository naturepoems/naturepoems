quote: "Over the fields of blue  
Cornflower rises,  
A carpet woven  
Of whispered dreams,  
The landscape breathes,  
Welcoming each step  
Into the vast hanging sky."

Over the fields of blue  
Cornflower rises,  
A carpet woven  
Of whispered dreams,  
The landscape breathes,  
Welcoming each step  
Into the vast hanging sky.
