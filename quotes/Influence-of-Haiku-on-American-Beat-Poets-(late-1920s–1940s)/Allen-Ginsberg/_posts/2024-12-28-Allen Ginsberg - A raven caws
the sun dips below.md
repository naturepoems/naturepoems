the sun dips below"

quote: "A raven caws,
the sun dips below hills,
a star arrives early—
a whisper of night calls,
time to drift to dreams, 
a dance of dark and light."

A raven caws,
the sun dips below hills,
a star arrives early—
a whisper of night calls,
time to drift to dreams, 
a dance of dark and light.
