The Gulf Stream

Flowing serenely, the waters bending,
  Into the arms of bright shores,
A tale of nature straining, blending
  The far and the near shores.

O sailor's heart does rise on wing,
  As the seas embrace
Where the tides impose cherry blossoms swing,
  To the bright, shining place.

Give heed to the waveâ€™s sweet lullaby,
  That endless harmony,
Let the earth and the waters sigh,
  Forever flow free.

- James Russell Lowell
