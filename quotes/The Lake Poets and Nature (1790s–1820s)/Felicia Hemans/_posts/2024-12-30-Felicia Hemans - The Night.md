The Night

The moon doth softly sail upon the sea,
At twilight hour, in silver sheen, so fair;
And stars of heavenly glow in harmony
Shed beams of light o’er a world that’s rare.

The nightingale sings softly in the glade,
Where weary travelers seek beneath her song,
And shadows dance in nature’s gentle shade,
Embracing beauty, sweet and pure, along.

Oh night, thy calm brings solace to the soul,
In every whisper of the breeze it stirs;
With grateful heart, we yield to thy control,
As bright the skies above our vision blurs.

In every twinkling star, we find delight,
For in the arms of night, our thoughts take flight.

—Felicia Hemans
