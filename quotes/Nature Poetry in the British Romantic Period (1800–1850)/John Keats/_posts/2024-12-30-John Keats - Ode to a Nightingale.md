Ode to a Nightingale
My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
   My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
   One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
   But being too happy in thine happiness,—

Thou art not the branch to bear  -  but the fruit,
   That pleads in innocence of pangs and grief.
When thou art gone, still glows a darkling hue,
   And I sink down and moan that I can’t follow,

And thou delight'st in the sweet thrill of the breeze,
   In thy minor key, a sobbing bough that goes
Through the warm dusk and outstretched shoulders trees;
   From you the world does perish and flows
Waiting for thy sound to quell the night,
And the soft whispered hush to never go out.
   — Ode to a Nightingale

- John Keats
