Above the shimmering lake,
The clouds shadowed the earth,
Birds darted near and far.
In the restless air,
Life moved in ripples,
A pulse in nature’s heart.

The sun bled gold,
Against the horizon's edge,
Painting visions on the water,
Where the world became a mirror,
Reflecting dreams and shadows.


- Louise Bogan
