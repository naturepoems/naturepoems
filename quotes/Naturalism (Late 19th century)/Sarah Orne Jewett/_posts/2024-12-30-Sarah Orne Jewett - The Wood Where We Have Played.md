The wood where we have played these years
   Is now so still and pale;
   The moonlight shines in cold clear spheres,
   And brings a ghostly trail.
   The sunny slope we did not see
   Beyond the river reed;
   The grassy knoll was good and free;
   The grey moss hung like weed.
   And now the autumn time is here,
   The golden leaves are folded back,
   Yet still I sit, and muse and fear
   The winterâ€™s lightless track.

- Sarah Orne Jewett
