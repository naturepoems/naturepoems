The Quiet Land

In the quiet land of shadows,
Where the golden sun shall set,
I shall find my peace in silence,
Where no troubles linger yet.

For the mountains stand so mighty,
And the valleys stretch as wide;
In that stillness I shall wander,
With the mountains as my guide.

- Rosa Zagnoni Marinone
