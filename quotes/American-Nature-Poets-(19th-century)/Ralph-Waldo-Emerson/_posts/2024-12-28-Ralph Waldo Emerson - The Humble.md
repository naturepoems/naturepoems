The Humble Bee

Burly, dozing humble-bee,  
Where art thou going with thy buzz?  
Thy head is a bee's, the honeyed hive  
Nests at thy low side,  
It breaks the blossom's honeyed heart  
That is all fruit and all without.  

He is the one who can tell us  
What nectar taste yonder seeks,  
'Twixt sunbeam and scent,  
He guards with fervour the summer's end.  

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
