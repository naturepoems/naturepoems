The desert unfolds under a blazing sun,
Where life finds a way, resilient and fun.
Cacti stand tall, guardians of the dry,
In their stillness, I learn how to try.

Mirages dance playfully, teasing the mind,
In the sweeping expanse, a treasure to find.
In silence, I ponder the stories they hold,
In the heart of the desert, I find myself bold.
