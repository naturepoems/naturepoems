Spring’s Return 

O spring, thou golden apparition,
Thou gentle breath of life anew,
In fields of green, in bloom's edition,
The flowers lift their heads to you.

Let the rivers run with laughter,
And the skies break forth in light,
For beauty’s song, it must be captured,
As winter's grip gives way to flight.

With every breeze a promise, born,
Of love, of peace, of skies restored,
In golden glow, and meekness worn,
Life rejoices, and all is adored.

- Amelia Welby
