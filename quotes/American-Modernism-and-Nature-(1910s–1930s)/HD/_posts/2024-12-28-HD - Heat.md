Heat

The swinging orbs of the heavens  
chase one another;  
the stars,
and the cool rustling  
 of leaves  
in the tall trees.  
There, in the cool night,  
we stand,
our nakedness washed in  
a long,  
low splendor:  
we sway, unknowing,  
that we too  
are before their light  
for the sea-motion. 
Let us kneel,  
for the heavy heart of the Earth,  
undulate under 
our knees.
