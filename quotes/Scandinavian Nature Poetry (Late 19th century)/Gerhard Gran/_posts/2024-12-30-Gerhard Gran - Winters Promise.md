The winter's breath brings crystal frost,
Upon the branches, crisp and light,
Each flake a diamond, love embossed,
On nature's canvas, pure and bright.

Yet in the stillness, warmth will rise,
The promise of the springtime sun,
Nature's cycle, wise and kind,
In every end, a new begun.

- Gerhard Gran
