In the fierce embrace of dusk,
As the world exhales the day,
I find myself reflecting,
On the beauty of letting go.

The sky burns with colors,
Orange and violet, a farewell,
Setting fire to the horizon,
And in this transitioning light,
A calm descends like a soft breath.

The songs of birds fade to whispers,
As stars awaken to the night,
With a promise wrapped in silver,
And the symphony of crickets,
Sings the world into dreams.

Let me dwell here in the twilight,
Where shadows dance with the astral,
In communion with the universe,
For in this sacred stillness,
I am whole, I am alive.

- Ettore Cozzani
