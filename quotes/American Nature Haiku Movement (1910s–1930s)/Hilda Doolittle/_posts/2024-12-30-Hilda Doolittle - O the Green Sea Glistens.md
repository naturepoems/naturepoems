O, the green sea glistens
      in mad, glimmering dreams!
      O, the dim-trees whisper  
      across the valley!
      O, the waves dance,
      in a beckoning silver!
      O, wild bloom, soft wind!
      I whisper, love!
      The sun is a wild thing,  
      summer drunk  
      on flowers and waves.

- Hilda Doolittle
