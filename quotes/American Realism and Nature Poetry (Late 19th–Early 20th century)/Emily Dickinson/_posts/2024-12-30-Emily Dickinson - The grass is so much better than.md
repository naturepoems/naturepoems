The grass is so much better than  
The Portion and the Wind –  
It cannot afford the Respiration –  
Of all the Florida Joy –  

The Trees are lost for many days  
For all is good and kind –  
Bigacious than Eternity,  
They War – and cease  

And to free your hand of Dread  
Is more than meets the Eye,  
To hold the Night’s Assurance,  
Beneath the Navy Sky.  


- Emily Dickinson
