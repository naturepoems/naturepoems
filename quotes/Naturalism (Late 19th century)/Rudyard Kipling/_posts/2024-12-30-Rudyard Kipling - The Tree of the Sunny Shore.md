The Tree of the Sunny Shore

Beneath the tree of the sunny shore,
I dream in the peace of the woods once more.
I mark the song of the breeze once more —
Its laughter echoes deep, on freedom’s core.

Wave upon wave of honeyed light,
Comes sailing in tender squalls of twilight.
The dusk grows deep where the waters sigh —
The tree holds close to each low borne cry.

I linger long with the humming birds' wings,
As shadows whisper and Nature sings — 
A vow is born ‘neath the stars that touch,
Where the tree of the sunny shore beckons so much!

- Rudyard Kipling
