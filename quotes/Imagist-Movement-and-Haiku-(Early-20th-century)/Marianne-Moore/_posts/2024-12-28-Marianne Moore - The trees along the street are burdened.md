author: Marianne Moore
quote: "The trees along the street are burdened with snow.
In the stillness, the branches bow, a quiet offering,
Their outlines blurred, a canvas of white and gray,
A landscape drawn softly, as if to embrace the cold.
A moment caught, breathing in the brisk, crisp air.
Peace rests gently in this winter scene."

The trees along the street are burdened with snow.
In the stillness, the branches bow, a quiet offering,
Their outlines blurred, a canvas of white and gray,
A landscape drawn softly, as if to embrace the cold.
A moment caught, breathing in the brisk, crisp air.
Peace rests gently in this winter scene.

- Marianne Moore
