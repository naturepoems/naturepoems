The Winter’s Heart  
Cold as ice and fierce as fire,  
Winter’s heart, a willful choir,  
Where frost adorns each barren tree,  
In stillness, life waits patiently.

With breath that steams in frosty morn,  
And sunsets draped in hues of worn,  
The winter sings its somber song,  
In nature’s hold, where I belong.

- Carl Robert Jakobson
