author: WS Merwin
quote: "As twilight approaches, colors bend,
Violet and rose entwine across the horizon;
A canvas brushed by unseen hands,
Blends of warmth fading to resolve
Into the dark, the quiet that comes
With the beating wings of night.
This pulse beneath the stars ignites
The heart of solitude wrapped in stillness."

As twilight approaches, colors bend,
Violet and rose entwine across the horizon;
A canvas brushed by unseen hands,
Blends of warmth fading to resolve
Into the dark, the quiet that comes
With the beating wings of night.
This pulse beneath the stars ignites
The heart of solitude wrapped in stillness.
