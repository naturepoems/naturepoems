There is a place in nature thine,  
Where heaven fills the air,  
With fragrant scents and colors bright,  
In summer’s golden glare.

Beneath the boughs the shadows weave,  
A tale that time has known;  
To all who wander, and believe,  
That life is never lone.

For every rustling leaf doth sing,  
Of joys forevermore;  
And heaven's harmony shall bring  
A beauty to our door.

So let me linger here awhile,  
And bathe in sunshine's grace;  
For nature's smile through every trial,  
Shall ever hold a place.
