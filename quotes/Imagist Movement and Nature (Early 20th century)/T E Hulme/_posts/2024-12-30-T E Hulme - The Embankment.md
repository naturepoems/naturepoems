The Embankment

I

The moon is a stone,   
A white, disc stone,  
That is waiting for the tide.

II

The sea is a vast,   
Wide glass.
And the waves are all
Little knives,
Shallow soft blades, -
They chop the stone.

III

Take that away from me,
That vast glass,
The knives of the tide
Have slain the moon.

IV

But I am living,
A large animal,       
With my teeth,      
And claws,       
That have taken
The skin from the stone, 
And I call for life.

V

The moon is dead,      
And my body,      
A stone less corner,      
Is waiting for the tide,  
Like death waiting for life.

- T E Hulme
