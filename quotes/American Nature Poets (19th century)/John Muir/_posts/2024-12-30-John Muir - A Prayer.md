A Prayer

Let me, O Nature, feel thy peace,  
Bring me refreshment in silence sweet;  
Each sunrise a balm, each breeze a release—  
With life in me, endless pursuits to meet.

In wild places, in solitude grace,  
Let whispering winds be the voice that I hear;  
In rustling leaves, in this vast, open space,  
Let me find strength to quell every fear.

Wrap me in beauty, unfold my soul,  
In nature's arms, I desire to be still;  
With mountains and valleys, the heavens extol—  
A gentle reminder of love’s greater will.
