The forest whispers secrets,  
Among the twisted roots and trunks,  
Where sunlight dapples on the ground,  
And every shadow breathes in dreams.

The air is thick with stories,  
Old as time and soft as moss,  
And here, beneath the ancient trees,  
Nature sings in muted tones.

Each leaf, a tale of seasons,  
Of storms that have come and gone,  
Of quiet mornings kissed with dew  
And evenings wrapped in golden light.

- Andrej Ērgļs
