Amidst the fragrant blooms, where the lilacs delight,  
The world bursts with color as morning greets night;  
Each petal, a poem, each stem a sweet song,  
In the garden of dreams, where souls simply belong.  

The perfume of blossoms wraps ‘round me like silk,  
Nature's gentle embrace, more soothing than milk;  
I wander through pathways lined with golden hues,  
Closer with each moment to the essence I choose.  

For in this lush haven, my heart finds its rest,  
In the vibrant embrace that nurtures the best;  
To lose all my worries, to dance with the air,  
In the beauty of Nature, I live without care.

- Marcel Proust
