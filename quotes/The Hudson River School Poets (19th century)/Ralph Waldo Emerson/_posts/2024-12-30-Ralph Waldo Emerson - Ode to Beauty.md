Ode to Beauty

O beauty ever, rare and bright!
Thou canst unveil my heart’s delight:
Wherever winds blow fair and free,
I chant thy praise in harmony.

Whether the light from garden beds
In rippling streams of gold descends,
Or whispers rise at misty morn
Where yarrow, wild and bold, is born,

Give me Love’s secret grace and tight:
Transform this heart a living light.
For every wave and bird combines
To shape thy songs in sweetest signs.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
