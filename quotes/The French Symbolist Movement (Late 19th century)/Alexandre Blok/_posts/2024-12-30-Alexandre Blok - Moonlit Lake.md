Moonlit Lake

Under the gaze of the silvery moon,
The waters shimmer, a delightful tune;
Reflections sway in the gentle ripples,
Where nature beckons, her soft scribbles.

A haunting calm, an enveloping peace,
As shadows stretch and the night finds ease;
The shorelines whisper, secrets unfold,
In this tranquil realm, a story told.

Oft, fleeting dreams skim the surface deep,
While the night cradles those in its keep;
Lost in the depths of a moonlit tale,
A soft sigh, a melody, a sweet inhale.

- Alexandre Blok
