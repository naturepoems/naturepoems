A Wanderer

I am a wanderer between the woods and fields,
The gentle stream and the gray mountain's heights,
Where eagles soar over the meadows' shield,
And the west winds paint the global sights.

With each footstep in fragrant clover,
I taste the honeyed air of roam,
Where the bloom of dreams runs ever over,
I seek with joy my nature's home.

Under a veiled sky of hues divine,
The spirit dances through each leaf,
From the tangle of the chaos entwined,
I interview my heart, become the thief.

- John Masefield
