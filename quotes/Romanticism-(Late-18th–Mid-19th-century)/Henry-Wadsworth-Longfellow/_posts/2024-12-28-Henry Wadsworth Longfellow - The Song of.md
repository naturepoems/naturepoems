The Song of Hiawatha
By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

By the shores of Gitche Gumee,  
      By the shining Big-Sea-Water,  
      Stood the wigwam of Nokomis,  
      Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis. 
In the sky the sun was setting,  
Placid in the world of waters,  
And the stars arose in stillness,  
Closing bright and silent vigil.
