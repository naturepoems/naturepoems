The Silent Lake

In quiet moments, still and clear,
The lake reflects all we hold dear.
With every ripple, every wave,
It whispers secrets, brave and grave.

The mountains loom, a guardian strong,
In nature's realm, where we belong.
And in the twilight, shadows blend,
The silent lake, our faithful friend.

So venture forth, and find your peace,
In nature's arms, let worries cease.
For in the stillness, heart’s awake,
In gentle sighs of the silent lake.
