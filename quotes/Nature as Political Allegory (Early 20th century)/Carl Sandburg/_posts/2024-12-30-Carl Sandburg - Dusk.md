Let the sun come in tears,
Like a breath at the end of the day.
Where the cool green leaves
Brush close to the cheeks,
And the open fields listen,
Filling with the colors of night.

Bring upon the coming dusk,
Soft linens, lightness,
Wrap us in the shining,
So we can dance, dance, dance,
On the circle of this world,
While the end comes in beauty, 
In the embrace of the earth at rest.


- Carl Sandburg
