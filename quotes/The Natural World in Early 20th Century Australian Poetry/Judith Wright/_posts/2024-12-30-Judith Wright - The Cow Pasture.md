The Cow Pasture

In fields of echoing silence
Where cows watch over the river,
Time slows to a standstill,
Breath becomes the pulse of the land.

The cows chew their cud,
Beneath the heavy-laden limbs
Of trees watching with old eyes,
And the grass bursts underfoot
In a wild rush of life.


- Judith Wright
