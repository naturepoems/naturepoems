Mother to Son
Well, son, I'll tell you:
Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.
It's had tacks in it,
and splinters,
And boards torn up,
and places with no carpet on the floor—
Bare.

But all the time
I'se been a-climbing' on,
And reaching' landin's,
and turning' corners,
And sometimes going' in the dark
Where there ain't been no light.

So, boy, don't you turn back.
Don't you set down on the steps
'Cause you finds it's kinda hard.

Don't you fall now—
For I'se still going, honey,
I'se still climbing,
And life for me ain't been no crystal stair.



- Langston Hughes
