The Ocean’s Edge

Footprints in the sand,
Dissolve in the sea’s embrace,
Waves crash in laughter,
Froth breaking light into glitter,
Reverberations of the deep,
Whispers from below.

Polished shells lie strewn,
Like hearts forgotten, mystical,
Each whisper a story,
That churns in the salty air,
The tide murmurs past dreams,
Evoking ghosts of wanderlust.

Where the horizon swallows the sun,
The sky bleeds orange and gold,
At this canvas of infinity,
In the dance of nature’s hand,
We are insignificant, yet bold,
In love with life’s fleeting moments.


- Hugo Ball
