The Brook

Like a child returning home,
I found the brook dancing with the sound
Of laughter creasing through my mind,
And the playful silver turns above.
In riotous whirl, it prances by,
And slipping, laughing, gurgling sings,
As the bright stones below
Flicker here and there in sunny streams.

—Henry David Thoreau
