A Silent Voices
Through the massed silence of the trees,
When the voice of the wind is a whisper,
And the stealthy tread of the leaves, 
Is the only sound to be heard,
I come to seek a lonely peace,
Where the heart takes root in silence, 
And the veins of the forest pulse, 
In the rhythm of nature's gentle breath.
Where the immensity of the sky,
Embraces the tops of the pines,
And the air is sharp, and the shadows deep,
I find my solace and sweet release.

- Louise Imogen Guiney
