The sun dips low, painting skies with its glow,
  As night cloaks the world in a velvet embrace.
  Stars twinkle gently like secrets they know,
  And the moon takes her throne, regal in grace.

  In the hush of the night, I find solace within,
  Where nature whispers softly, cradling my soul.
  The beauty around me, both quiet and kin,
  Reminds me that life is its own glowing scroll.

- Anna Brigadere
