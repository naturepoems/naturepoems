The mountain's majesty calls to me,  
With peaks that pierce the azure sky,  
Each rugged face a story told,  
Of ancient times that pass us by.  
Clad in snow, or wrapped in mist,  
A guardian of the valley’s fate,  
I feel the pulse of the earth below,  
In every heartbeat that I await.

- Ellen Ballance
