A Little While  
Tell me, a little while,  
You will not turn away;  
The shadows it makes—  
Will melt beneath the skies,  
Like leaves that retreat in the hush;  
We shall meet in springtime sunshine  
When all upon us smiles.  
Tell me there has come,  
Not yet a day but loves a trust star.

- Christina Rossetti
