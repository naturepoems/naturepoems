quote: "The sea is a great blue stage,
The waves, actors in a dance,
With foam and spray that break and play,
Against the rocks, unceasing, fierce;
Nature’s theater, ever engaging,
Life’s eternal, rhythmic, and free."

The sea is a great blue stage,
The waves, actors in a dance,
With foam and spray that break and play,
Against the rocks, unceasing, fierce;
Nature’s theater, ever engaging,
Life’s eternal, rhythmic, and free.

- Ezra Pound
