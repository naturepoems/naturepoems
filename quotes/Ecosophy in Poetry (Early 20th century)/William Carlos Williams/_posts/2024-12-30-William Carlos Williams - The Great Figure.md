The Great Figure

among the rain

and lights

Of the city

that float

Like a butterfly

in the large

night sky

I saw

Ten

By the truck

in the night

I could

hear them

through the night

Obsidian

Shining like

the street

lamp's eye

And I could

not help

but wonder

What it

was like

For the

old woman

who raised

her hands

to the sky

- William Carlos Williams
