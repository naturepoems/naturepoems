The Nature of Time

In the stillness of the woodlands deep,  
Where time itself seems to stand still;  
The rabbit hops, the deer does leap,  
In tranquil peace, the heart does fill.  

Each season’s change, a sacred rhyme,  
A cycle that we cannot see;  
In nature’s hands, the flow of time,  
A dance of life, eternally free.
