Earth's Answer
Prison'd on this earth,
I give you my love no more,
For it is destructive, weakening,
Of the freedom of our ground!

I see her the stars breathe,
   In their adoration,
   And that the birds signify
What can be felt,
   And heard.
I cherish her, for I see again
The harmony of the world.

- William Blake
