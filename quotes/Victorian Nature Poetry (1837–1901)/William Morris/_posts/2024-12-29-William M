Spring

  The winter’s sun is changing morn to day,
  The frost that bound the stream has fled away,

  The woods are ruffling into leaf and bloom,
  The flowers breaking from their sodden tomb.

  So let thy love be fresh as spring avails,
  As fragrant buds bring life upon the trails.

  Let the golden glory of the season’s fold,
  Be matched by joys that never will grow old.

- William Morris
