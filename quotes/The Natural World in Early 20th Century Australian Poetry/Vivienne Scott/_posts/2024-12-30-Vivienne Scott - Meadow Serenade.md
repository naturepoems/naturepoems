In a meadow where the bluebells sway,  
The sun spills gold at the close of day,  
Every breath infused with grace,  
In this sanctuary, time finds pace.

As twilight weaves its purple shroud,  
The earth stands still, yet sings aloud,  
Beneath the starsâ€™ eternal watch,  
Nature whispers, dreams to hatch.
