Beneath the surface where silence sings,  
The ocean’s depths, a secret trove,  
Whispers of currents, the stories they bring,  
Multicolored dreams where legends rove.

Shards of light in fractured waves,  
Tales of sailors, of lost and saved,  
An echoing call from hidden caves,  
Nature's lore in the blue engraved.


- Yves Tanguy
