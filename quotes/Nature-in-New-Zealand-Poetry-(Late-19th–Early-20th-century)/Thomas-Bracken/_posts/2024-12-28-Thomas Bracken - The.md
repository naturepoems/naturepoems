The River
 
Upon the mad river, deep and wide,
Where whispers of wind carry tales,
I wander in splendour, nowhere to hide,
As my heart's echo folds and trails—

The waters they dance in their crystalline song,
The laughter spills over the stones,
While nature reclaims her dominion so strong,
And o'er the wild world softly moans.

I find in her presence the peace that I seek,
In her arm both fierce and warm,
Through the wild caress of her tumultuous streak,
In the river, I find shelter from harm.

- Thomas Bracken
