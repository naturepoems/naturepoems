Upon the hill there is a tree,
An aged tree it is, and gray;
And on it hangs, as if a bee,
A very little ball of play.

Not so many years ago,
It rose so high, with branches wide,
And â€™neath it, in a shade of snow,
The birds have plucked and made their bide.

Ah! but now the bramble weaves,
And wraps about it as a chain;
And every bird that once it leaves
Finds comfort elsewhere, feeling pain.


- William Browne
