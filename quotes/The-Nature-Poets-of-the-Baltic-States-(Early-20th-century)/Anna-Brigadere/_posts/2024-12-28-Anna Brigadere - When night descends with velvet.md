When night descends with velvet cloak,
And fireflies flicker, softly spoke,
The moon spills silver on the field,
Where secrets of the night revealed.

In darkened woods, the echoes cry,
The hidden life, a lullaby,
With natureâ€™s pulse, our spirits blend,
In whispered winds, we find a friend.

- Anna Brigadere
