A Summer Day

In the summer day
when the sky opens wide
and the clouds sail on,
I fall asleep among the flowers,
under the shade of the birch tree,
with the soft warmth all around me.
My dreams float like dandelion seeds
carried on the breeze,
yet I listen to the wind sings
the melodies of the gathering clouds.
The air is sweet with honey,
for each flower drinks
and a butterfly rests on my shoulder.
I hear the unentering quiet,
and awaken to find
that the summer day
has wrapped me in its arms,
with nothing needing to be explained,
as the rain comes softly falling.

- Mary Oliver
