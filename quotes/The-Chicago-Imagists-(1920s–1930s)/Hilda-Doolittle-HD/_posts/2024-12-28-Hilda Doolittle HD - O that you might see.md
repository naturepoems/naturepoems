O that you might see  
      The green flake of dawn,  
Or touch with a hand the rice  
      Of the fallen stars  
That burst from the sky—  
      A flower of the earth!  

For the dawn is like a water-lily  
      Floating deeper in the light,  
Its roots are trembling,  
      Dream-like and fragile,  
Beneath the beauty of the day.
