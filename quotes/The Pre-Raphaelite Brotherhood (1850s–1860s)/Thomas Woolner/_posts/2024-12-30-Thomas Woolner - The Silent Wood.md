The Silent Wood

In silent woods where whispers glide,
I stroll among the gnarled old trees;
With every step, the earth's soft sigh,
Brings solace borne upon the breeze.

The sunlight dapples on the ground,
A golden quilt of light and shade;
And in this sacred, hallowed ground,
I find my thoughts from worry laid.

Each leaf a prayer, each branch a guide,
In nature's arms, I am unchained;
For in her stillness, all collide,
As heart and earth become unfeigned.

- Thomas Woolner
