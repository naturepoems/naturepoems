Nature, the Only God
Thou art my breath and spirit from the morn,
As stone upon the air waves swiftly wakes,
A line of song unbroken, yet unshorn,
Let time that weaves the running brooks that pace.
The life of vines and forests' gentle grasp,
Arose in silence, born to be the flame:
Hear, days unfold eternal joy to clasp,
Let every thorn, its bitter nip, proclaim.

Thou art not still; upon thy face delights
Of shadows theft and moments blown aloud.
Ever I rise amid the whispering heights,
O Nature! endless beauty’s captive crowd!
To thee I turn, to life, to gentle peace,
O joyful Being! Gan my heart release!

- Henry Vaughan
