The Frost

The frost of night on heaven’s breast,
  The glittering world below,
  One soft moon's picture, time's caress—
  The stillness of the snow.

A silver dawn in dreamless rest,
  The air is like a dream,
  And ghostlier than the brightest jest,
  The hills are pale with gleam.

O quiet earth and starlit sea,
  Let this remain the same,
  And I will weave a world of thee,
  Where love might see its name.

- William Wilfred Campbell
