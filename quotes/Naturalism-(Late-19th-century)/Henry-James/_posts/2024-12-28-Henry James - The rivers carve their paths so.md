The rivers carve their paths so wide,
Flowing fiercely, nature's pride;
With each bend, they whisper lore,
Echoing tales of the wild and more.

They sparkle like jewels under the sun,
A shimmering dance, a race never run;
In their currents, I find my fate,
With nature's rhythm, forever innate.


- Henry James
