To the Moon

O Thou pale queen of night,  
With all thy shining cast  
Upon me in thy light,  
Bring dreams of times long past.

What stories dost thou tell  
Of lovers ‘neath thy rays  
Who bid the earth farewell  
To dance in thy bright ways?

As flowers bloom in dew,  
They bask in Thy caress;  
What scenes dost thou renew,  
A lover’s soft redress?

Guide me with radiance clear  
‘Twixt shadows and bright dreams;  
And hold my heart so near  
As silent as thy beams.

- John Davies
