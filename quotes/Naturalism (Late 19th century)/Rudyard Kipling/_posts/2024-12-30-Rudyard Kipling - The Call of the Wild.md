The Call of the Wild

The night comes heavy to the shore,
The moon rides high, the storms will not implore.
In the darkness lies my yearning song,
â€˜Neath the stars, I find where I belong.

The rustling leaf, the whispering tide,
The wild within I cannot abide.
Take me where the beasts run free,
In the wild, I find my destiny!

- Rudyard Kipling
