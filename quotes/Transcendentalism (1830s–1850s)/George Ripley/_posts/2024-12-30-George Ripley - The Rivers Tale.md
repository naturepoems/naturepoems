The river flows, uncharted,  
A tale of life's sweet departure,  
Underneath the whispering winds,  
Where the heart forever loiters,  
In the dreams of ages past.

Each current tells a story,  
Of journeys near and far,  
Reflections of the glory,  
That dance beneath the stars,  
As time unwinds its golden thread.


- George Ripley
