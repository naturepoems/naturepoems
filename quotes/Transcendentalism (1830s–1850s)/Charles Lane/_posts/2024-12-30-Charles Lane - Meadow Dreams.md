A tranquil meadow, lush and bright,
Beneath the sun’s warm, golden light,
Where every blade of grass is kind,
In nature, a peace we hope to find.

The flowers dance, the butterflies,
Flit freely under open skies,
In this embrace, we’ll plant our dreams,
In nature’s hands, life brightly gleams.

- Charles Lane
