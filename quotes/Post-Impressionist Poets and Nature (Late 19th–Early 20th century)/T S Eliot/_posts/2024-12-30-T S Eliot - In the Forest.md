Beneath the boughs, where shadows play,  
   Nature's secrets are kept at bay.  
   The murmurs of leaves, the rustle of grass,  
   Hold tales of wisdom, through ages that pass.
   
   In the heart of a forest, serene and vast,  
   Echoes of laughter recapture the past.  
   Join the dance of the creatures, large and small,  
   For in nature's cradle, there's magic in all.

- T S Eliot
