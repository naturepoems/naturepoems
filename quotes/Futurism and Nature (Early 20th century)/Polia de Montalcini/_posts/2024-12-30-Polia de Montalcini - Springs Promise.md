Spring’s Promise

Awake from slumber, the world,
renews its vows with the earth,
how tender, the blossom’s sigh,
opening to the sunshine’s warm kiss.

Each bud is a proclamation,
a burst of color unfurling,
a symphony played gently,
on the strings of nature’s heart.

Listen!—the echo of life’s laughter,
a dance within the dark soil,
as hope rises from hibernation,
beckoning all to witness—
a promise profound, of what is yet to come.

- Polia de Montalcini
