Birches
When I see birches bend to left and right
Across the lines of straight, narrow roads,
I like to think some boy's been swinging them.
But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.
Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
After a rain. They click upon themselves
As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.
Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-covered ground.

They are dragged down by the load, and yet,
When I see birches bend to the left and right,
Across the lines of straight, narrow roads,
I like to think some boy's been swinging them.

I’d like to get away from earth awhile
And then come back to it and begin over.
May no fate willfully misunderstand me
And half grant what I wish and snatch me away
Not to return. Death is not the end. I do not know.
I’d like to get away from earth awhile
And then come back to it and begin over.

I am going to put myself in the position,
Of swinging through trees, both winter and summer,
Back to the way I was as a boy,
To go back to being alive in the woods.

I would like that sort of immortality,
One that provides an illusion of being alive,
Holding the trees and air around.
For that is my heaven.

- Robert Frost
