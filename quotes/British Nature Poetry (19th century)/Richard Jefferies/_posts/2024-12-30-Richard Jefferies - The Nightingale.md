The Nightingale
In the shade of moonlit trees,

I hear the nightingale’s sweet pleas,

Her song a balm for weary souls,

A melody that gently rolls.

With every note so rich and pure,

She sings of love that shall endure,

In evening’s hush, her voice rings clear,

A serenade for all who hear.

- Richard Jefferies
