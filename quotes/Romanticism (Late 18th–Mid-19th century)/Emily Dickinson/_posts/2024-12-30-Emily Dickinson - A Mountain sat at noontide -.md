A Mountain sat at noontide -  
In his Vermilion robe -  
His head was full of Mist -  
And his throat, the double globe -  

In thousands, to assume -  
The grandeur, yet unfold -  
He mid the gaze of many -  
And his gaze is double gold -  

And though the gold -  
Of many flows -  
Yet only we, of Mortals -  
For a dream to unfold -  

Into what diviner  
Of upper Range -  
He merely sat, in silence -  
And all the stars were there -  

Then all that was light -  
What the scene could know -  
Graced by Heaven, credulous -  
Yet filled with such a glow -  

Effused through all his Accent -  
The Audacity that now -  
Seemed as profound, as finitudes -  
Underneath, Power’s bow!

- Emily Dickinson
