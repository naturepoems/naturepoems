Fragrance of Dusk

Evening drapes its shawl of stars,
a soft sigh escaping the day,
and in the garden, petals close,
a gentle cupping of the light.

Lavender fills the fading air,
in each breath, memories linger,
at twilight’s cusp, hush descends,
a lullaby from the earth’s embrace.

The horizon blushes in farewell,
yearning for the night’s embrace,
where shadows weave into the twilight,
a tapestry stitched with whispers of dreams.


- María Pizarro
