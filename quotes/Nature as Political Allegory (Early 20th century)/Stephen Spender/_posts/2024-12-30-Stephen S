Petals fall like soft whispers, 
In the garden paved with quiet love, 
Brushing the edges of darkened dreams, 
Where shadows cradle the stars above. 

Delicate scents weave through nightly air, 
Filling the heart with ancient lore, 
A murmur brushed with a tremble of fear, 
As nature holds the secrets of yore. 

Here among the thorns and gold, 
I lay myself within the night, 
For the earth is a cradle, 
To the lost, the seekers of light.

- Stephen Spender
