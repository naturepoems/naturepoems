The River's Path

As water weaves through land and time,
In currents swift, a rhythm rhyme,
The river flows, a life so grand,
In winding trails, the heart's command.

With every bend, new vistas show,
In nature's touch, the moments flow,
To follow where the waters lead,
Is to embrace the spirit's creed.
