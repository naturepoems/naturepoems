In silent woods where no man treads,
  The ancient roots hold tales of old,
  They flourish where the wild bird spreads,
  A myriad of dreams unfold.

Let nature's breath enfold you near,
  Where whispers of the past resound,
  In every shadow, feel no fear,
  For life’s sweet rhythm knows no bound.

- Isaak Walton
