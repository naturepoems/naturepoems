In the Open

Here in the open, I find my soul,
   Where the skies are bright and clear,
And nature sings to me in her role,
   A symphony to its cheer.
With each gentle breeze, and sunlit ray,
   I’m cradled in a world complete,
And with every step, I’m free to play,
   On the grass and the earth, beneath my feet.

- John Burroughs
