title: "Louise Imogen Guiney - The ReturnThe winds of autumn gently blow  A whispered tale that stirs our heart  As leaves drift down like dreams that slow  And beauty yields professing art  We journey back through thorn and bloom  Each step awakes a hidden grace  And nature sings of sweet perfume  A call to life in every space"
