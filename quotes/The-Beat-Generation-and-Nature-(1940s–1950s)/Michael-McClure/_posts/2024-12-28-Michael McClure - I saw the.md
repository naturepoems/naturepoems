I saw the mountains,
        their faces like old gods
in the folds of time,
    each ridge a record,
        carved in the flesh of earth.

The rivers behind them
    are shimmering veins,
        carrying the blood of the land,
teaching the skies
    to listen,
        to bend low.

- Michael McClure
