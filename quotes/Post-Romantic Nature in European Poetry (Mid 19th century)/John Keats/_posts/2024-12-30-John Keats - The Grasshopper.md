The Grasshopper

I am a grasshopper, soaring sky,  
On wings of green and brown I fly.  
I sing where the sun and shadows meet,  
And weave my song where earth and sky greet  
The gentle dance of life in bloom.  

The morning dew gives way to light,  
As daisies sway at dawn’s first flight.  
While bees hum softly, with golden gleam,  
I leap along with nature’s beam. 

— The Grasshopper

- John Keats
