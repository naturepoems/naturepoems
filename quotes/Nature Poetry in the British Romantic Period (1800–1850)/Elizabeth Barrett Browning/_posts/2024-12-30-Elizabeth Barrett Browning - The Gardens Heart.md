In the quiet of the garden fair,
Where roses bloom and scents declare,
A tapestry of colors bright,
Invites the heart to pure delight.

Each petal soft, each leaf so green,
A harmony, a tranquil scene;
Among the bees that buzz and hum,
A life replenished, ever come.

So let us walk, hand in hand,
In nature’s gentle, loving land;
With every step, our hearts entwined,
In this sweet solace, peace we find.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
