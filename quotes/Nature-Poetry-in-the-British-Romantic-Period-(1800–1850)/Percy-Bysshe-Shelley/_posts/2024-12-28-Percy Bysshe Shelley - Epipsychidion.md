Epipsychidion
One loaf of bread to two men: to day the lark
Blushed with the rapture of Spring in bloom,
In the quiet bower, blue and white,
All the land seems caught in an ecstatic swoon.

The water swells, the air is alive
With the murmurs of Nature sweet as sweet can be,
Upon the bush, the leaves do dance, and the crier,
Should sing what is precious upon the tree.

Oh, be the harmony of my heart,
When these flowers fall, the snow shall be spent,
As with clear notes beneath the green,  
We shall rest within the shade of the spring.


- Percy Bysshe Shelley
