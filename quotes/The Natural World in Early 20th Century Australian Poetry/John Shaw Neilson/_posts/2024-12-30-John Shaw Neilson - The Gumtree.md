The Gumtree

The old gumtree stands proud and tall,
    Its branches reach the sky;
With leaves that dance like fairy’s call,
    It charms the passer-by.

Yet in its shadow lies the ground,
    Where creatures of dusk dwell;
And deep beneath the roots is found,
    The earth’s own secret well.

- John Shaw Neilson
