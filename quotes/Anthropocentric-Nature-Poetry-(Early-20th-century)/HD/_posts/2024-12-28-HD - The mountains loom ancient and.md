The mountains loom, ancient and wise,
telling tales of the ages,
whispering voices in the winds.

It is here, in their shadows,
that I feel the pulse of life,
a thread connecting all beings.

Under the blanket of stars,
each constellation winks,
a reminder of muffled dreams.

The earth cradles us,
as we wander beneath its cover,
a dance of the ephemeral.
