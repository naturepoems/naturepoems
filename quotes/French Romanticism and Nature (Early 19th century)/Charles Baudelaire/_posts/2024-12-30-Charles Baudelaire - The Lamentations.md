The Lamentations
 
In the solemn depths of a twilight wood,  
Where trees lament and shadows brood;  
The rustle of leaves, an ominous sigh,  
Echoes the whisperings of days gone by.

Beneath the sun’s departing kiss,  
I weep for the beauty I shall miss;  
As dusk unfurls her silken veil,  
The nightingale sings of love’s frail tale.

Each echoing note, a haunting cry,  
Of nature’s providence, death can’t deny;  
Such beauty dwindles under dark’s embrace,  
Yet life’s echo lingers—a sacred trace.

- Charles Baudelaire
