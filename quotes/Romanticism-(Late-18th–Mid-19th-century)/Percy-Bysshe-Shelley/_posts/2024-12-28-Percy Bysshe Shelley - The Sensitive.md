The Sensitive Plant
A sensitive Plant in a garden grew,
And the young winds fed it with silver dew,
And it opened its fan-like leaves to the light,
And closed them beneath the kisses of night.

It blossomed and drooped, and the leaves were rife,
With the gentle sighs of the morning life.






- Percy Bysshe Shelley
