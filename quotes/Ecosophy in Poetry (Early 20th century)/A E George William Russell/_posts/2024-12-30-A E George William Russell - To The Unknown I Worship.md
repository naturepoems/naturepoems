To The Unknown I Worship

I know not your name, I know not your face,  
But I feel your presence,  
In the quiet of the place;  
In the murmur of the brook,  
In the sigh of the trees,  
In the soft, sweet embrace  
Of the fragrant breeze.  

Oh, spirit of the forest,  
Of the sky and the sea,  
I will follow you ever,  
Wherever you choose to lead me;  
I will wander your pathways,  
I will walk in your light,  
I will feel that you love me,  
In the silence of night.

- A E George William Russell
