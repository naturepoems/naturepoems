A MOONLIGHT SONATA.  (From a Japanese Garden.)
A quiet wind stirs the trees.
The moonlight floods the garden.
The stars are whispers, hidden in the leaves.
I am no longer myself, but a flower.
I sway beneath the moonlight;  
I drift like a cloud across the sky.
The night envelops me,  
And I dance softly with the shadows.

- Amy Lowell
