The Lion’s Bride
The world was made of light and doom  
Before your time began,  
In the stillness of the afternoon, 
Beneath the languid sky.

You were born to be alone,  
To roam through tangled trees  
In search of mysteries, like stones  
That float upon the sea.  
Your heart beats restless in your breast, 
And so you go to find your rest.

Among the ferns and leaves of dusk  
That wrap around your thoughts,  
To face the stormy sky and mouth,  
In the secret of the woods.  
There is a light of knowledge still,  
A purpose, strong, as time will fill.
