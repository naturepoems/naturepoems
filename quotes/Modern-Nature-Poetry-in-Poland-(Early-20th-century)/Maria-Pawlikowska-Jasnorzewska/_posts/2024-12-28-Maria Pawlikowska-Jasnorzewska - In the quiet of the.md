In the quiet of the grove,
A soft hush blankets the air,
Where time bends around me,
And the world falls away.

Here, among the breathing earth,
I find fragments of me;
The flowers' embrace, the moss's sighs,
All weaving into a tapestry,
Of who I am and who I can be.

- Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
