Disillusionment of Ten O'Clock

The houses are haunted
By white nightgowns.
None are green, or purple,
And none are a starlight-clear
In a cool few tar stains
to remember a mythology.

The jug, the scope, the angle
Translates time, and the response
to that timelessness we perceive
does something much deeper; none but decades.

It is night, and all
The sleeping is shaken out,
While the silver-spooned, the snarled
Of one; and a rumor begotten,
That turned down could join us from below,
To tap ground.  

In a language of unspooling,
No language, a tangled court
And a red lizard lost; the northern moon
Expects peace.

- Wallace Stevens
