The Maple,
Leaves fall with the wind—
a dragonfly hangs,
cutting along the gold,
creeping toward the tender branches—
its twilight hues blurred,
although we both fade
as shadows thicken,
kissing the ground
with their sorrow—
yet a web emerges,
bearing ripe autumn colors,
a tapestry of life upon longing.

—Marianne Moore
