To An Old Philosopher in Rome

What do you gather in the night
When the stars move over the eyes
And the leaves whisper a heart
to the foliage above?  
They bring their nature into consciousness:  
There, hearts are warmed, loved always,
From the poets across the places, yet become 
Faded to the landscapes—so lightly
Hear how sweet the blue light beams, 
Where the firmament never forgets,
To lift the hawk high and remember still. 
And what rises through forms— 
You can think again, can you feel? 
To see this land is traced 
With the distant past within memory— 
May all thoughts of the mountain retreat 
Until lassitude reigns in view,
As consciousness beholds what surrounds, 
For into the night the kisses do fall. 
Now let the peace fall from their leaves, 
And at twilight, retreat into dreams.
.

- Wallace Stevens
