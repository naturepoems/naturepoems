A Last Confession

The world is full of flowers midst the rain,
    And not a one should bloom if we forgot;  
Yet I would see you in the morning again, 
    And tell you one last story that is not.
For every last farewell must come my way, 
    And we shall see upon the river’s feathery flight,
With every loving gaze we bend to stay,
    Each perfect flower that fills the day;

- Edna St Vincent Millay
