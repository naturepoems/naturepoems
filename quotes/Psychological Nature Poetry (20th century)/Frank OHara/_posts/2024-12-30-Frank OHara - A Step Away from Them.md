A Step Away from Them
    I was in a hurry,
in a little tunnel made
of cement and light,
  each step
    taking my heart out,
    and you free
    from the complications
of any other thing.
The sound of birds
dropped from the trees,
 and the park was knitting
            in colors
      around my head,
            laughter layered
             in petals,
         the world waking
me up,
          scattering all my fears
in a field of tulips and joy.

— Frank O’Hara
