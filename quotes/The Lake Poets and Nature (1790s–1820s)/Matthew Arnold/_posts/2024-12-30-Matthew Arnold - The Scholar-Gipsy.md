The Scholar-Gipsy

Go, for they call you, shepherd,  
To the dappled meads,  
Where the flowers lie upon the grass,  
Touched with the changing winds of night.

Yet tell me, kind, and is it always dark?  
Is there no sun on earth?  
O let me wander till the death of night
   Opes the long entrance of the skies…  


- Matthew Arnold
