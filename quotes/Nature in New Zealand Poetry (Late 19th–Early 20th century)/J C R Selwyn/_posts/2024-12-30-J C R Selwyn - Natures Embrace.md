Nature’s Embrace
In nature’s arms, I feel the grace,
The soothing balm, the warm embrace,
Each leaf that flutters, soft and light,
Whispers the wonders of the night.

The stars align, a cosmic choir,
As fireflies dance in sweet desire,
With every breeze that ties our fates,
I feel as though my spirit waits.

To wander free amidst the trees,
Where time stands still and hearts find ease,
In this embrace, I shed my cares,
For nature knows the love she wears.

So let me linger, lost in dreams,
Where every brook and flower seems,
To share a bond beyond compare,
In nature’s heart, my soul laid bare.

- J C R Selwyn
