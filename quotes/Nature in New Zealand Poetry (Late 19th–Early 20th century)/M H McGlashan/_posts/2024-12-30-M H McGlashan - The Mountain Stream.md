The Mountain Stream

I wandered by a mountain stream,
  That laughed in crystal glee,
Its waters danced and like a dream
  They whispered unto me;

The pebbles in their shiny beds
  Were graced with nature’s art,
While rich, green foliage softly spreads
  Its arms around my heart.

The silver fish glint through the flow,
  The dragonflies adorned,
With wings like jewels, flashing glow,
  Their beauty, thus, reborn.

In every ripple, clear and bright,
  A story’s being told;
Of ages passed, in fleeting light,
  Of silver and of gold.

What joy to linger, wise and free,
  Beside this flowing stream,
For here, amid the world’s decree,
  I’m lost in nature’s dream.
