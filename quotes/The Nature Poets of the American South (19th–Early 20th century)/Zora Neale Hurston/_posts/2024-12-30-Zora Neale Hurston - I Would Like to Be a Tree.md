---

I would like to be a tree,
One that is not a part of mundane things.
A tree that grows tall, proud and free,
Casting shade on restless kings.

I would weave dreams with my leaves,
And rustle gently in the breeze,
A home for birds, a respite for bees,
Where all who seek will find their ease.


- Zora Neale Hurston
