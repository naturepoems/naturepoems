Frost
Upon the window, heavy and white,  
The frost has painted its thorns of light;  
Each blade of grass, each leaf in sight,  
Glistens like jewels in the pale moonlight.  
The trees stand silent, wearing a crown  
Of crystal shards, like a king of renown.  
The world is a canvas, both beautiful and stark,  
In the chill of winter, in the stillness dark.  
Yet within this beauty, a warmth we find,  
For nature's wonders fill the heart and mind.  
So let us revel in the frost’s tender grasp,  
And hold this moment in nature’s clasp.  


- F T Palgrave
