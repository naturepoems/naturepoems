The winter's chill upon my face,  
A world transformed in white and gray,  
Yet in this cold, I find a place,  
Where nature rests, its fierce display.

With every flake that falls so light,  
A blanket wraps the earth so tight,  
In stillness speaks the quiet night,  
In winter's grip, I feel delight.

- Hjalmar Hegner
