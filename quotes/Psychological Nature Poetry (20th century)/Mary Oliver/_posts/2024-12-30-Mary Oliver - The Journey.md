The Journey

One day you finally knew
what you had to do, and began,
though the voices around you
kept shouting their bad advice â€”
though the whole house
decided to throw you out,
even though you knew
you had to be happy.
Now you will live in a place where
trees rise like pillars into the sky,
where the creek flows
over smooth stones
a place of laughter
and light that fills your soul.
You must listen,
for even the moon
dazzles beneath the dark,
one more thing
you had to do,
and that was to love
your own wild,
wild life.

- Mary Oliver
