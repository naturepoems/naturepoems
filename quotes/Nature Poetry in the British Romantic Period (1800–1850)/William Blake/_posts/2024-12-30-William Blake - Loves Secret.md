Love's Secret  

Never seek to tell thy love,  
Love that never told can be;  
For the gentle wind does move,  
Silently, invisibly.  

I told my love, I told my love,  
I told her all my heart,  
Trembling, cold, in heart did ache  
Then she turned away to part.  

My own love, my own love,  
My joy I must not sing;  
But it loves a whisper lightly,  
My heart to a trodden spring.

- William Blake
