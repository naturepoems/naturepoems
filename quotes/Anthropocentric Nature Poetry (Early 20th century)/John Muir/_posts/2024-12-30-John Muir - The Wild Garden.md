The Wild Garden

In my wild garden let the flowers grow,
With little care and a lot of love,
The bees and birds that wander through,
They work their miracles up above.

The fragile petals sway in the wind,
Each sprinkle of rain like a gentle kiss,
I find my peace in the chaos,
Nature in its splendid bliss.

Let the wild things reign,
Their beauty without bounds,
In every leaf a story,
In every root, the ground.

- John Muir
