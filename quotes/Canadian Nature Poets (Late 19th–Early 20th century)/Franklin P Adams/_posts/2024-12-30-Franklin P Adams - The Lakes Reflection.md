The Lake's Reflection

Beneath the sky, so vast, so deep,
A quiet lake lies still in sleep,
Its silver mirror holds the light,
Of every star that graces night.

The whispered echoes of the trees,
Speak gently with the balmy breeze,
Nature’s heart in stillness flows,
In every ripple, beauty grows.


- Franklin P Adams
