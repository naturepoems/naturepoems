Eloquence of decay,  
     these forests weep;  
         branches claw at the vibrant void,  
   sigh of petrichor mixing with breath—
   the decay sings,  
      and we dance,  
      temporary as the fading light,
       like moths swirling in midnight’s embrace,  
   drifting towards the unknowing.
