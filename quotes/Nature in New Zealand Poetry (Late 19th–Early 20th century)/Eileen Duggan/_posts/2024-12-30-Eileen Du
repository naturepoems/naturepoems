Soul of the Earth

There’s a heartbeat that flows from the river so wide,
And a pulse in the forest where creatures abide,
The earth sings a lullaby, soft and low,
In each twist of the vine, in each bloom and grow.

With the mountains as guardians, grounded and wise,
And the sky ever changing, a canvas of lies,
In the threads of this life, I find my own worth,
For I am but a whisper in the soul of the earth.

- Eileen Duggan
