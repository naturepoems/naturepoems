author: WS Merwin
quote: "On the edge of autumn, the air
Carries hints of what is lost,
Each leaf a memoir, a layering of stories,
From the green embrace of summer's hold
To the brittle edge of winter's grasp,
Yet even as they rustle, they smile,
Turning a farewell into a waltz,
A dance toward the naked embrace of cold."

On the edge of autumn, the air
Carries hints of what is lost,
Each leaf a memoir, a layering of stories,
From the green embrace of summer's hold
To the brittle edge of winter's grasp,
Yet even as they rustle, they smile,
Turning a farewell into a waltz,
A dance toward the naked embrace of cold.
