The autumn leaves flutter, like memories untold,  
Cloaked in fiery colors, crimson, amber, and gold;  
With each fall, a reminder that seasons must change,  
That life is a circle in beauty, so strange.  

The crispness of air brings a whisper of chill,  
As Nature prepares for her quiet, still thrill;  
In the silence of evenings, a promise is spun,  
For endings are but pauses, till cycles are done.  

Let me gather the moments as leaves drift away,  
For in tender goodbyes, there lies hope for today;  
In autumn’s embrace, I learn to let go,  
In the dance of the harvest, the seed waits to grow.

- Marcel Proust
