Forest
The ancient trees whisper secrets,
their branches entangled,
a green cathedral envelopes,
where shadow and sunlight play.
They breathe together,
the scent of earth and decay.
I close my eyes,
and let the sounds surround me:
a rustle, a crack, a bird in flight.
Here, in the world's lungs,
I find my peace,
rooted in the silence.


- Julian Tuwim
