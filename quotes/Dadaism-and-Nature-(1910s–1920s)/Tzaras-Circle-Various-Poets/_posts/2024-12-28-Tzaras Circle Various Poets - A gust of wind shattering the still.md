A gust of wind, shattering the still—  
   clouds collapse,  
      an opal sky mirrors chaos,
        swirling thoughts like leaves,
         drifting...
     Come, dance with the ephemeral flowers,
   let petals rain in silver hail,  
the world is a dreamless sleep;  
   all together, a jigsaw of roots.
