O to love the wildness of the mountains,
Where the rivers rush and the pine trees gleam,
Where the eagles scream through the valleys,
And the shadows play on the hilltops,

O to wander amid the granite and clouds,
To see the world, vast, where nature breathes,
In the delight of the green that blooms,
In the whispers of the winds that weave,
And to find, again, 
The spirit that lives in every blade of grass.

â€” From "Leaves of Grass"

- Walt Whitman
