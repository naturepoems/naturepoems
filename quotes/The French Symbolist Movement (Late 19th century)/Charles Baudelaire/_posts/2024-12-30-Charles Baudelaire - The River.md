The River

As the rivers flow with silver veins,
Churning in currents of serenity's call,
From hills that rise with the last disdain,
Thy gentle whispering winds do enthrall.

Oh bounty grateful who rides lifeâ€™s stream,
Let wander broad smiles through your embrace,
In the tranquil deep where the one shared dream,
Where fleeting life retains the sweetest grace.


- Charles Baudelaire
