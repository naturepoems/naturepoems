Sea Garden

The sea-garden is a perfect channel,
with waves pulsating so near and dear.
Let your tears rise right beside—
a fresh beat, or will, roll steady in time.
Let the cloud 
curl back on the strand;
a spiral refresh,
young like the sun.
I am sometimes the first to leave,
the silent stage of tints and shimmers,
climbing up high for the thrum.
Here in the golden water,
I am reduced 
into salt and fire.
Give grace to my heart neath the moonlight; 
blossom into dawn  
in perfect tune.
