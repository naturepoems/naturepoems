In an evening stillness, 
    the river reflects the sky’s blush, 
    as twilight reigns in its soft crown, 
    wearing the colors of a lover’s heart.  

Cicadas serenade the dusk,
    their melodies rising, 
    like smoke from a forgotten fire, 
    and the world pauses, 
    cradled in this tranquil moment.  

Moonlight weaves through branches, 
    illuminating the path, 
    as shadows dance to the rhythm 
    of Nature’s lullaby.
