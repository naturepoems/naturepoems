In the Woodlands

O, how the woods are fair, the fields are bright!
As if they were a garden full of flowers;
The air is filled with the sweet scent of delight,
And every bird sings in the shady bowers.
In the green depths where shadows blossom round,
I walk beneath the silver rippling brook,
I hear the crows in chorus harshly sound,
And in the pond a lily opens like a book.

- Thomas Woolner
