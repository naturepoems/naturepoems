The sun sets slow upon the hill,
A golden hue, a gentle thrill;
The sky transforms to hues of pink,
While twilight weaves its shadows, links.

The stars awaken, one by one,
As daylight fades and night’s begun.
A serenade of crickets sighs,
And echoes softly, through dark skies.

The world submits to night’s embrace,
In every thicket, every space.
Nature sleeps, yet dreams awake,
In whispered vows and shadows’ wake.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
