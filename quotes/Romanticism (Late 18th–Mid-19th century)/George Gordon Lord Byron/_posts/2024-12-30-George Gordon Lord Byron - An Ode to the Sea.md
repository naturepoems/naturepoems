I sat upon the shore of the great sea,
And watched the waves as they came thundering in,
Their wildness, their beauty, their power to be,
Inviting my spirit to dance in their din.

The spray kissed my face, the wind tugged at my clothes,
A symphony of fury, chaos and grace;
The roar and the whispers of Nature’s own prose,
Calls forth a connection in this timeless space.

All of my worries dissolved like the foam,
The rhythm of tide, the vast blue sky,
In this wild embrace, I felt utterly at home,
Forever in tune with the earth’s mighty sigh.

- George Gordon Lord Byron
