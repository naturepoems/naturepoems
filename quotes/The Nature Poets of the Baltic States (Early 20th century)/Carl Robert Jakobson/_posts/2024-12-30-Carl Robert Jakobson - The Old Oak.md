The Old Oak  
Stalwart and wise  
in the meadow's embrace,  
roots deep in the earth,  
a timeless grace.  
Branches that stretch  
toward skies of blue,  
a sheltering arms  
that welcome the dew.  
Oh, ancient oak tree,  
your story unfolds, n
in rings of the years  
youre gathered in folds.

- Carl Robert Jakobson
