The Ant

A small ant on a soldier's trail,
Laboring in the summer heat,
In the careful assembly, its own way,
Striking out, returning, with purpose,
Climbing steep, navigating the world;
The tiny live-force, industrious and proud,
Noble in its persistence, no matter the scale,
Crafting the earth's great, grand design.

- Marianne Moore
