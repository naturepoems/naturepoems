The Fountain

I sit by the fountain in the dusk,
Where the water whispers its soft song,
The leaves in shadow gently sway,
As time drifts by, eternal and long.

Oh, how the stars begin to gleam,
In the velvet sky, a peaceful dome,
Each drop of water reflects the night,
A memory that brings me back home.


- Anna Akhmatova
