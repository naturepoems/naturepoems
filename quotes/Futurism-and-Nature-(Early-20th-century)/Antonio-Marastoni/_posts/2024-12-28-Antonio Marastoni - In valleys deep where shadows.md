In valleys deep, where shadows creep,
And rivers carve the ancient stone,
The whispers of the earth, they keep,
A language soft, a tone of bone.

Mountains rise, like dreams untold,
Their peaks, a mirror to the stars,
In natureâ€™s arms, we find the bold,
The universe, in cosmic bars.

- Antonio Marastoni
