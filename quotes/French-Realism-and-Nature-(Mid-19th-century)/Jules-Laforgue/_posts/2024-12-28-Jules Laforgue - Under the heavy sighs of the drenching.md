Under the heavy sighs of the drenching rain,  
I find a world lush with promise,  
Each drop a caress upon the earth,  
Awakening dreams buried within petals,  
Painting grace upon the landscape’s brow.  
Oh, the sweet symphony of nature’s weeping,  
A melody that resonates through my veins,  
And as the storm gives way to tender light,  
The world emerges anew, dappled in hope.

- Jules Laforgue
