Clouds drift like thoughts across the endless sky,
Each shape a story, a moment to share.
I watch them float, I breathe in the day,
Finding solace in the vastness of air.

The world stretches on, an expanse untouched,
Every horizon a mystery yet to unfold.
In nature, I find my arms open wide,
And welcome the secrets of the day yet untold.

- Henry David Thoreau
