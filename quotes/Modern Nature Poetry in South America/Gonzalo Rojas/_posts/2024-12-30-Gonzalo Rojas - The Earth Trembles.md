The Earth trembles
beneath my feet,
yellow flowers,
yellow foams of the sea,
eternal fields,
yellowing hearts.

And I, Gonzalo,
young poet of the mountains,
man of a thousand words,
find my solace,
for the rainline waits.

In the roots,
the anchor of the tree,
yearning endlessly
for the sky.

Oh, how I listen
to the whispers
of the leaves.

- Gonzalo Rojas
