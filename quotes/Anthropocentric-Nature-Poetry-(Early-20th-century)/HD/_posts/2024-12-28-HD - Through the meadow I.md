Through the meadow I wander,
at dusk the horizons blend,
yellow and purple hues,
a painter’s distraction.

The harvest moon rises,
gliding smoothly into view,
each beam a kiss, a caress.

Nature’s chorus swells,
a symphony of night;
the owl calls its wisdom,
wisps of sound in the dark.

Tonight, we gather under stars,
a communion of all living things,
a reminder of our connectedness.
