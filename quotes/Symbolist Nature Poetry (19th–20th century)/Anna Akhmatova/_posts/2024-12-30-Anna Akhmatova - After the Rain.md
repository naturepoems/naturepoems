After the Rain

After the rain, the world awakes,
With a freshness that fills the air,
The colors bright, the earth revitalized,
A symphony of beauty rare.

In every droplet, a sparkle glows,
As nature breathes, rejuvenated,
In this pure moment, I find my peace,
As the world rejoices, awed and celebrated.


- Anna Akhmatova
