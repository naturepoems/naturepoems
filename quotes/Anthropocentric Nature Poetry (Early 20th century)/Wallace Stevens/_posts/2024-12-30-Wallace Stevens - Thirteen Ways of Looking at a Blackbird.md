Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird

I
Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.

II
I put a black thing in a bag,
And I put a bag in the river;
And the bag was in the river,
And the bag was of water.

III
The blackbird whistling
Or just after.

IV
I would whistle, I would 
Take the blackbird to the cloud;
And the blackbird would listen.

V
I looked at the blackbird
And the blackbird looked at me
And no one knew where the other
Was from.

VI
The blackbird sang.
