In the cradle of spring, life dances anew,
Awakening blossoms, each hue a delight.
The fragrance of lavender spills on the dew,
As day breaks with soft, golden light.

Songs of the birds fill the crisp morning air,
With melodies weaving through branches and leaves.
In this vibrant world, there's love everywhere,
Natureâ€™s canvas is full, it achieves.

- Anna Brigadere
