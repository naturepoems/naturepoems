The mountains rise, in solemn grace,  
Their peaks like spirits, touch the skies,  
Where clouds drift softly, free as thought,  
And the horizon reaches wide and wise.
  
Such heights, they cradle dreams of old,  
Whispering secrets to the air—  
Nature, in her splendor bold,  
Invites the soul to freely dare.


- Friedrich Hölderlin
