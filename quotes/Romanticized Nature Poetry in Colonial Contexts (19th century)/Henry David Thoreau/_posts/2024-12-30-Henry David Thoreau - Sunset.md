Sunset
---

As day yields to the night’s embrace,
The horizon glows with a warm, still grace,
Sunset’s palette rich and bold,
An artwork painted in crimson gold.

Each ray a whisper, each moment rare,
A fleeting glimpse of what we share,
In sunsets past, we find our way,
In every twilight, a hope at bay.

---

Let us gather in evening’s shadow,
For in this moment, our spirits follow.


- Henry David Thoreau
