A Day in June
Oh joy of life when days are right!
This sun-streaked morn unfolds with glee,
And reawakens heart and sight,
With summer spread in reverie.

The flowers burst with colors bright,
Each petal seems to breathe in tune,
And air, with warmth and soft delight,
Plays close around us like a boon.

So let us raise our voices clear,
To praise the day, this gentle tune,
As life unfolds a love sincere,
In every heart, a June in bloom.

- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr
