The horizon glows with amber light,
As day gives way to duskâ€™s embrace;
Each color blends in wild delight,
As nature paints her silent grace.

Mountains whisper to the sky,
Clouds drift like dreams of yesterday;
In the heart of time, we stand still,
Lost in the magic of the day.

In unity with the earth and air,
Let the pulse of life awaken;
For in this moment, pure and rare,
We find the truth, unshaken.

- Arthur Rimbaud
