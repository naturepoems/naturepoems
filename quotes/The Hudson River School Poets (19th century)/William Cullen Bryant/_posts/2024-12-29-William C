The Valley of the Shadow

There is a valley dim, and vast,
   Where quiet forms and shadows cling,
   Where the whispering winds of silence pass,
   And secret tones of sorrow sing.

Its gentle brooks, in the quiet night,
   With silver sounds, like notes of care,
   Give all their thought to each in sight,
   As nature speaks the soulâ€™s despair.

Oh be the soul they speak of too,
   The light of peace that guides the spark,
   In everything their glowing hues,
   And lends a grace to depths so dark.

- William Cullen Bryant
