A single flower sways,
a dancer in the wind,
and in her movement,
my heart finds solace,
her colors mirror my soul,
bright against the canvas of despair.

In each petalâ€™s curl,
a whisper of hope,
a reminder
that in fragility lies strength,
a fleeting moment
that speaks of eternity.

- Octavio Paz
