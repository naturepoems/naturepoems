The world stands out on either side
No wider than the width of a sod,
That’s a day’s march on either side,
But the world made small is to be loved
Where the clear, shining water
Drips into the sun;  
There’s no cloud above the dirty bird
And the world is as bright as the courage in a dove.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
