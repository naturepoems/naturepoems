In the Garden –  
I stand –  
With Nature for a friend –  
And whisper to the flowers  
As blossoms come to life –  

The Morning glories’ laughter  
As bright a Dream as mine –  
Filled with dew and sunlight  
That dances on the vine –  

Nature welcomes all the Souls  
Who roam her verdant fields –  
And share the secrets lifted  
By every breeze she yields –  


- Emily Dickinson
