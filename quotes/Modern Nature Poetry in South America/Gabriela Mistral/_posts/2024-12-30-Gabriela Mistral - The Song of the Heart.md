The Song of the Heart

A voice rises free as flowers sing  
a tune hovering over,  
steadily spotted by the dew,  
it hums soft  
to perfection.  

Through fields of a thousand petals,  
the sweet scents twine,  
as whispers roam through night,  
ending with bright noons,  
lost awakenings partake  
honesty, sunlight softly holds.  

Within that heart of spongy love,  
shall we find the ways  
to reminisce wild winds,  
ending destiny in tune  
with secret languors of old,  
unfurled.

- Gabriela Mistral
