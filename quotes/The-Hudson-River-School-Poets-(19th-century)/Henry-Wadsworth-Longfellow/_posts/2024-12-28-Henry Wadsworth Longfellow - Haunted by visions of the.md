Haunted by visions of the past,
The forest stands in stately grace,
While shadows flicker deep and vast
Across the quiet, solemn space.

And every whisper of the breeze
Seemed filled with memoryâ€™s song as well.
I wandered lost beneath the trees,
Where all my musings found their spell.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
