The Stolen Child
Where dips the rocky highland
Of sleieve bloom or hallaun,
Away with spindrift gray and designation, 
Away with gilded white marsh of the moon.

And I would not sleep when you sang for me,
Until the world's beauty enshrined the sea.
And I would roam where the pit-weep calls
And play beneath the softly falling light.

Where the river leans to the silver sea,
Take me away to the sounds and smells of the earth free.

- William Butler Yeats
