Love the earth and sun and animals,  
Despise riches,  
Give alms to every one that asks,  
Stand up for the stupid and crazy,  
Devote your income and labor  
To others,  
Hate tyrants,  
Argue not concerning God,  
Have patience and indulgence toward the people,  
Take off your hat to nothing known or unknown,  
Or to any man or number of men,  
Go freely with powerful uneducated persons,  
And with the young, and with the mothers of families,  
Read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your life,  
Reckless of your location,  
Or who you are,  
For the ear is not fully open till it hears the roar of the ocean.

- Walt Whitman
