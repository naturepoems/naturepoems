Flight of Aquilina
   by Louis MacNeice

Aquilina flies above the pine,  
Her wings pulse with the echo of earth's delight,  
Crisp air she breathes in perfumed solace,  
While valleys stretch and the world ignites,  
Life is a melody in deep blue sky,  
Nature turns, where wonders ariseâ€”  
Aquilina sings as she glides in grace,  
A flight through dreams, the past replaced.

- Louis MacNeice
