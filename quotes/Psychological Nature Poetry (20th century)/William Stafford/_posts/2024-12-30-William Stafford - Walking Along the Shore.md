Let the soft wind speak,
   let the waves breathe their song,
     as you walk along the shore.
Every ripple holds a wish,
        every splash
            a story yet told.
In these moments,
     we find reflections of ourselves
       in the dance of the earth,
and we are free.


- William Stafford
