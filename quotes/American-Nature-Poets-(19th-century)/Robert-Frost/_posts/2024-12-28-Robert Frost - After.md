After Apple-Picking
My long two-pointed ladder’s sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still, and there’s a barrel that I didn’t fill
Beside it, and there may be two or three
Apples I didn’t pick upon some bough.
But I am done with apple-picking now.
Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.
I cannot shake the shade of apples in my mind.

I feel the weariness of the world, and I
Will linger more and more, before the night,
Until I can recall the apple-flavored day.
But I have had a day of apple-picking now.
I cannot shake the shade of apples in my mind.

And the sleep in what is a winter’s night
Calls my senses to taste and rouse me now,
To seek a new brightness up and handle live,
To know that this apple-picking is done, tomorrow I awaken.
For soon I must go down again.
Until then, this day I have had
An apple-filled bough and in my mind the scent of apples,
And I feel myself drowsing off.

- Robert Frost
