The mountains, shrouded in mist,
Stand tall and resolute—
Eternal witnesses to time,
With whispers of wisdom,
Echoing from the past.
They cradle me with their arms,
Reaching out, grounding my spirit,
In every inhalation of pine,
In every heartbeat with the earth.

               – From "Echoes of the Mountain"
