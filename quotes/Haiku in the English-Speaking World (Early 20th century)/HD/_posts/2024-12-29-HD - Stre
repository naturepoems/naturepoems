Oh, let the streams
rush down the mountains,
let the trees arch and sway
into the deep blue sky.
The wind is a messenger,
a call to adventure,
a calling to wander
through the valley's embrace.
The flowers bloom,
a riot of color,
a daily miracle,
whispering tales of magic,
of the earth's vibrant pulse.
In every leaf and petal,
in all that is alive,
there lies a quiet truth,
that we are never alone,
that beauty surrounds us,
if we dare to see.
