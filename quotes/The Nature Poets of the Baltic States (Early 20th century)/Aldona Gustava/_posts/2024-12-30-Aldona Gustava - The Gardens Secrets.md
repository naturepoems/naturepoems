The Garden's Secrets
In hidden nooks a garden grows,
With blooms that whisper tales of old,
In every petal, life bestows,
A treasure chest of secrets told.

Among the herbs, the bees do hum,
Each scent a memory to unfold,
In nature’s arms, we’re never numb,
In every root, a dream enfold.

- Aldona Gustava
