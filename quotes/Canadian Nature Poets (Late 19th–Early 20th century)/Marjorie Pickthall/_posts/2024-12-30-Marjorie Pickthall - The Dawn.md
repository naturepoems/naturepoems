The Dawn

When morning breaks with gentle grace,
A blush of light adorns the sky;
In golden hues, the world we face,
Awakening hearts with every sigh.

The first soft note of day begins,
As birds in chorus ring the chime;
In every drop of dew there spins,
The promise of a new-found time.

- Marjorie Pickthall
