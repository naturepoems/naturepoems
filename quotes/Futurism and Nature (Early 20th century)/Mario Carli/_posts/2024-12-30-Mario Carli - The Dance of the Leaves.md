The Dance of the Leaves
In the forest's embrace,
Leaves dance in rhythm,
A ballet of rustling whispers,
Green and gold,
Caught in the breeze's light caress.
Each flutter and twist,
A celebration of life,
As sunlight dapples the ground,
Textures of shadow and light,
Nature's canvas,
Ever changing, ever beautiful,
In the symphony of seasons,
The leaves beckon,
Join in their dance,
For life is fleeting,
And beauty calls,
Answer in kind.


- Mario Carli
