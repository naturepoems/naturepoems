Stars

The stars are scattered in the sky,
Like diamonds twinkling from above,
Each one a wish, a tender thought,
A promise wrapped in endless love.

In the stillness of the night,
They light the path to dreams untold,
I reach for them, my heart takes flight,
In their embrace, I find my gold.


- Anna Akhmatova
