I am a Poet of the Sea,
And there’s a voice yet o’er my head,
That calls with sweetness all to me,
The song of winds, a fate well-read,
Where heaven’s vast space and waters meld,
With Heaven still rolled up secrets gold,
From starry sets and light compelled,
The Sounds of Nature, great and bold.

-- Robert Southey, "Songs of the Sea"
