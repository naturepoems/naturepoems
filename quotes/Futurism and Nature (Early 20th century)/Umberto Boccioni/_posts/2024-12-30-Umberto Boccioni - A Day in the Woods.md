A Day in the Woods

In the dappled light,
a thousand hues collide,
trees whisper tales,
of ancient roots and skies.

Moss carpets the ground,
a soft embrace on bare feet,
harmony reigns
in this sacred cathedral
of leaves and air.

Branches embrace,
forming a roof of green,
a shelter for the heart,
a refuge from the relentless haste
of the world beyond.

And as silence prevails,
i feel the oldest pulse,
beating thin and quick
between the leaves,
reminding me,
we too are of the earth.
