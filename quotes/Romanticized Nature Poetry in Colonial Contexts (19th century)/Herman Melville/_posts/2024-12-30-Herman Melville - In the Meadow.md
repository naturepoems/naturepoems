In the Meadow
In a field where the daisies bloom,
And the robins play, with laughter sweet,
I find a peace, free from all gloom,
Amongst the flowers where moments meet.

The sun paints gold on swaying grass,
Its gentle rays caress my face,
As breezes sing where soft winds pass,
And time slips by in perfect grace.

Each footstep soft, like whispered dreams,
Each coloring shade, a soft delight,
In nature's dance, the spirit beams,
And feels the warmth of day and night.

So linger here, my heart's reprieve,
In this meadow where wild things soar,
For in this beauty, I believe,
Life’s radian truth forevermore.

— Excerpt from "In the Meadow" (not an actual poem of Melville)

- Herman Melville
