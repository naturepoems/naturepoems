O read the world, all its wonder!
At your golden gaze
And the elements respond
In mute homage; fire wings
Flame-drenched and wind-beat
Grass violins hum
In slow, rhythmical motion.
Fires burn beyond this fading earth
Luminous tints in the sky.

Ah! you are the seeking soul!
That gleams over every direction!
Try the noise between the trees,
The silence of evening shadows.
Dip your hand into the cool
Wells of memory - prisons of sound.
