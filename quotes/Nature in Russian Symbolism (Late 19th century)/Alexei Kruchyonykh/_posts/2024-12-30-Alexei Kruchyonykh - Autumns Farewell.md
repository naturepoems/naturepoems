Autumn’s Farewell
Leaves of amber float down softly,
In the crisp air, a chill speaks so loftily.
Nature's palette shifts as daylight wanes,
Autumn’s farewell, a dance without chains.

Whispers of winter brush against my cheek,
In the hushed tones of dusk, the silence speaks.
Each falling leaf, a memory released,
A cycle completed, nature’s great feast.

- Alexei Kruchyonykh
