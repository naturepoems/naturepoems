Morning Prayer

I rise with the sun,
cradling a cup of coffee
and the world sings
a fresh tune...
a melody rising
in the dew.

Each note is a call,
a prayer for the day,
for the mountains, valleys,
fields stretched far,
breathing with me.

Let me honor nature,
let me honor her spirit,
let me walk her footsteps,
let me breathe her air.

For in this moment
I am one with it all,
and the sun blesses
each new dawn,
a reminder,
we are connected,
woven in the fabric
of this great journey.
