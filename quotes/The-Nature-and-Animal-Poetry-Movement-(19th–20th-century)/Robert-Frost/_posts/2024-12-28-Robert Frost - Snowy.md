Snowy Evening
The sun was gone, long gone, lost somewhere
Among the shadows of the autumn air,
I heard the call of cold, clear, lonely night,
And brushed my cheeks with the gentle fright.

I walked through fields where they lolled together
In the moon's embrace, singing storms in tether,
With every breath I gathered winter's tale,
As nature's whispers turned to heav'nly wail

The trees stood still, bare branches clawed the sky,
Each tip a jagged shard, sharp and dry,
Yet in the quiet air, all quiet held
Reminders of spring's joy, a sweet spell.

So tender was that winter hush,
And deep in frost we fell to trust;
The season's chill brought not despair—
But gentle grace of beauty rare.

- Robert Frost
