Soul of the Forest

In the quiet woods where the shadows meet,
There lies a depth in the drumming beat,
The heart of the forest, ancient and wise,
Speaks to the seeker through leafy sighs.

The sun weaves gold through branches high,
While the spirit of nature will never die,
Here in the stillness, the soul gets free,
In the forest’s heart, I am, and I see.

For in the rustle of leaves, and a soft breeze,
Life whispers secrets among the trees,
And in every heartbeat, we find our lore,
In the soul of the forest, we are evermore.


- Robert Penn Warren
