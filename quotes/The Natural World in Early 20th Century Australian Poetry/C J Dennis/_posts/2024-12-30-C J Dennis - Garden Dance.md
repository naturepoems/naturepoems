The garden's alive, with a tapestry bright,
As the petals of roses awake to the light;
And the laughter of butterflies, flits in the air,
In a whirl of the colors, a vision so rare.

While the scent of the jasmine floats soft on the breeze,
Each flower has a spirit, that brings us to knees;
As we take in the wonder, with each smile of grace,
In the heart of the garden, we find our true place.
