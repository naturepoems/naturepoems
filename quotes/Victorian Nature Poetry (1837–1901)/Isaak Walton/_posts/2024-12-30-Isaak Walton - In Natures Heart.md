Let not the rush of city life,
  Distract you from the wild's allure,
  For in the woods, away from strife,
  You’ll find a peace that feels secure.

With open arms, the realms await,
  To breathe the air, to feel the sun,
  In nature’s heart, we find our fate,
  A journey shared, a race well-run.

- Isaak Walton
