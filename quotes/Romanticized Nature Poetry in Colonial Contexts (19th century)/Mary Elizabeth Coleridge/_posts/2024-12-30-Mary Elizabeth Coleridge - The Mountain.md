The Mountain

O mighty Mountain, crowned with snow,
Your heart is forged of ancient stone,
In every crevice, rivers flow,
Whispering tales of ages flown.

Your shadow stretches wide and far,
A guardian of the valley’s peace,
In every dawn, you greet the star,
And know the silent secrets cease.

Through storms and calm, you stand so grand,
The pride of Nature’s bold embrace,
In every footstep, in every hand,
The call of freedom finds its place.


- Mary Elizabeth Coleridge
