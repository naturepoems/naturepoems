SONNET VII

There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,
   And purple and troubled skies,
And out of which winds slip across my heart,
   And the wild birds sing true, I rise—
   Where quiet lingers strong,
And footsteps they must tread;
With the rustling of new blades of grass,
And the song of those soon left for dead.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
