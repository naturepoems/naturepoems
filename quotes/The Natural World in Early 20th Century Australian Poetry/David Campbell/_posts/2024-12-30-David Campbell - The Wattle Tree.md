The Wattle Tree

Oh the wattle tree, oh the wattle tree!
  Who can mark your true potentials
For a love that pulls at your arms at the gate
  Where the warm wind's gentle essentials

Weigh down the night till the morning strays,
  Where the light and the gladness grow;
Your branches in tender arms stretch and sway
  Like the flames of a fire so low.

The softest sound of your roots when I hear
  The whisper of sunshine above,
Just beside the path to a heart, my dear,
  Where the flowers will fall like a dove.

When the stars lie low on the wattle blooms
  And the world offers more than the price,
I listen for hearts that can glide with the glooms,
  With the fireflies dancing in nice!

- David Campbell
