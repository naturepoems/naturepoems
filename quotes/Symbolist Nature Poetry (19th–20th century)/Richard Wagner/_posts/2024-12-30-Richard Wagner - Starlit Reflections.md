As night descends with stars aglow,
The world is draped in velvet shade,
In the hush, life moves soft and slow,
In every whisper, a pact is made.

The cosmos breathes a timeless night,
Where dreams and reality embrace,
In nature’s arms, we find our flight,
In the vastness of this sacred space.

- Richard Wagner
