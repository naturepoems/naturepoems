The Fall

Through the leafless trees of autumn,
  The wind is on my way,
  And the dim and shadowy twilight, 
  Is like a summer's day.

I wander in the stillness,
  Where the silent earth is bare,
  With spectral lights of lingering hues,
  And sunshine everywhere.

A spell of fading glory
  Walks softly in my heart,
  And I feel the woe of whispering woods,
  As if they dream apart.

Ah, the beauty of the silence,
  And the peace that comes and goes,
  When the echo of the leaping stream
  Fades with the fading rose!

- William Wilfred Campbell
