The Issa Valley

I remember the valley,
alone and quiet,
where the river flows.
The banks were smooth,
covered with soft grass,
and the willows leaned,
like old friends confiding,
whispering the secrets of the world.

I saw the sky,
with clouds reflecting,
a fading light,
as evening fell.

In that place, I felt
my heart connected
to the pulse of nature,
a soft heartbeat,
a whisper of the universe.


- Czesław Miłosz
