A nosegay of violets,
Sit under the dew
For a while with me,
While I chant your praises.
The nightingale shall sing,
The poppies shall stir,
When I pluck a flower,
Pine-needles shall spring to life.
Under the surge of starlight,
And a moon-reed shall carry
A tune of its own.
Take these words, sweet violets,
God bless your dews.  


- Robert Graves
