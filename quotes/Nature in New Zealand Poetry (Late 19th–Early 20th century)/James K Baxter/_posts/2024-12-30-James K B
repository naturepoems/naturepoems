The trees stand sentinel,
a silent watch,
a gathering of history,
a testament to endurance.

Bark and leaf,
youth and age,
a wisdom wrapped in green,
a library of stories held
in their branches.

I look up in awe,
my heart a prayer
for these giants
that shelter our dreams
and breathe life into our spirits.

- James K Baxter
