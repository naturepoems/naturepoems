The trees are my friends.
They sway gently in the breeze,
Whispering secrets of the ages,
Their leaves a chorus of green delight.
Under their shade I find solace,
Nature’s embrace, where worries dissolve.

I listen to the rustle, the dance,
Of branches reaching for the sky,
A testament to resilience,
Witness to yesterday’s storms,
And tomorrow’s promises of sun.

In their company, I am whole,
Each leaf a story, each trunk a memory,
Under their watch, I breathe deep,
The fragrance of earth, of life,
A reminder of my place in this world.

- Umberto Saba
