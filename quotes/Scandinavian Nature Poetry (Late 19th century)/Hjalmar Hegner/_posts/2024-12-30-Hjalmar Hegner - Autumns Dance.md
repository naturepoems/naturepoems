The autumn leaves, they drift and sway,  
A tapestry of red and gold,  
A fleeting glance, a whispered way,  
In nature's arms, a tale retold.

As seasons change and time moves on,  
In every leaf, a memory stays,  
To dance upon the cool, crisp dawn,  
In natureâ€™s grace, my heart now plays.

- Hjalmar Hegner
