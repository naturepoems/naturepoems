quote: "The mountains rise, ancient and wise,  
Sleeping under clouds' soft caress,

In the embrace of their shadows,  
I find solace in the stillness."

The mountains rise, ancient and wise,  
Sleeping under clouds' soft caress,  
Time suspends,  
In the embrace of their shadows,  
I find solace in the stillness.
