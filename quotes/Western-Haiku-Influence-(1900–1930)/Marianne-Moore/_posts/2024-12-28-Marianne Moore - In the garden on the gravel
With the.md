With the sodden leaves, halting a moment,
Looming dim, the vertices of flowers
Honeyed with petals, daintily bending
For a wind, releasing a handful of rain."

In the garden, on the gravel,
With the sodden leaves, halting a moment,
Looming dim, the vertices of flowers
Honeyed with petals, daintily bending
For a wind, releasing a handful of rain.
