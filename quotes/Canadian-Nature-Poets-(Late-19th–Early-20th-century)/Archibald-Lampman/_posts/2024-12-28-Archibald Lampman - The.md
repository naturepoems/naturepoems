The Dawn

Awake! for dawn doth touch the earth with fire,  
And paints the sky with shades of brilliant hue;  
The morn awakens dreams and soft desire,  
As nature’s song unfolds the day anew.

The golden sun begins its quiet rise,  
And cast its brilliance o’er the world below;  
The dews are gems, a treasure in disguise,  
Where flowers bloom and streams of brilliance flow.

O dawn! the spacecraft of the day in flight,  
Awaken hearts, with hope and joy renew;  
In every breath, the world felt strongest light,  
A sacred promise held, forever true.

- Archibald Lampman
