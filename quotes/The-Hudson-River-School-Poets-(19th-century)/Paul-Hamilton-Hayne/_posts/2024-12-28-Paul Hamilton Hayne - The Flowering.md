The Flowering Wilderness

Where the ardent sunbeams fall,
On the vernal meadow's breast,
And the breezes, light and free,
Seek the willow's sleepy rest,

There my heart can wander long,
Unencumbered, free as air,
Where the flowers weave their throng,
In the sweet enchantment rare.

- Paul Hamilton Hayne
