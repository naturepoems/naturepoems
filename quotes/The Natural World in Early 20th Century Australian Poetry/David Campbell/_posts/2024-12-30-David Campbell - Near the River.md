Near the River

I know the quiet lines of the timbered creek,
  Where the shadows break and creep,
With the wildflowers catching soft lips of the weak,
  And the willow bends as I kneel in deep.

In the wind, I can hear their hushed flames,
  The sweet whispers folding by day,
Where the dance of gold becomes treasure and names,
  And a gloaming reflects from the gray.

Let the waters slideâ€”while I rise, I claim
  A moment alone in her grace;
O the shimmering sunlight takes nothing but shame
  Of a world that lifts at my face!

- David Campbell
