A Dream
I dreamed that I was lost in a wood, 
  Where the roses wound in and out, 
Where the shivers of sea ran young and good, 
  And the shadows whispered about. 
Where the white stars peep through the larch, 
  And the vivid shoots of morning flash, 
In the light where souls may never arch, 
  Nor lose their peace, nor leave a dash.


- Walter de la Mare
