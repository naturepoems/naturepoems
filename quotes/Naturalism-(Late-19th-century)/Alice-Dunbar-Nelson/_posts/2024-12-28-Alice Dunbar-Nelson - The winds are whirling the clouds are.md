The winds are whirling, the clouds are flying,  

In the depths of the wilderness we shall roam;  

Away from the track of the busy and dying,  

To the haunts of the wild and the blooms of our home.


When the great full moon with her silver light  

Turns the droplets of dew to jewels so bright,

We'll wander alone, hand in hand, side by side,  

In sweet, quiet places where the wild things abide.

- Alice Dunbar-Nelson
