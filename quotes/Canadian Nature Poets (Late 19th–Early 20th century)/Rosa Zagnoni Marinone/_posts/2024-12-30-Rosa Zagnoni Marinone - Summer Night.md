Summer Night

Beneath the stars, the summer night
Wraps the earth in silver light;
With every breeze, the whispers play,
In nature’s arms, I long to stay.

The moon, a lantern in the sky,
Sends forth its glow, a soft reply;
While crickets serenade the dark,
In this sweet hour, I find my spark.

- Rosa Zagnoni Marinone
