May
Thou art a girl of dainty form;  
Spring in thy steps, thy smile is warm,  
The blossoms tremble in thy wake,  
And every bough begins to shake.  
The music of thy laughter trill,  
Rings merry in the sunlit hill;  
O come, dear May! with love that’s true,  
To wake the heart, each day anew.  
Thy eyes are like the azure skies,  
They draw us forth, as light doth rise;  
Thy breath is sweet as lilacs strown,  
And every heart shall call thee home.  
So dance along, thou merry maid!  
Bring forth the joy that ne’er shall fade!  


- F T Palgrave
