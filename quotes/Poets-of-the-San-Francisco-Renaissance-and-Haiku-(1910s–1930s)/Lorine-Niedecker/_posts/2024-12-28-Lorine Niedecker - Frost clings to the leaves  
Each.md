quote: "Frost clings to the leaves,  
Each blade a fine crystal,  
Reflecting a world  
Tinged with whispers,  
The stillness of winter  
Holding secrets  
In the woods."

Frost clings to the leaves,  
Each blade a fine crystal,  
Reflecting a world  
Tinged with whispers,  
The stillness of winter  
Holding secrets  
In the woods.
