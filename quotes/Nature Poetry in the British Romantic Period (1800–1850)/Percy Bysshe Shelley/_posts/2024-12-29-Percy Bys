### Clear, Clear, Clear 

Clear, clear, clear, the vessels disappear,  

And, tremulous shadows, the waves, they ooze,  

Upon the sand of this dew-glossed ground,  

What whispers sweet that the silence can infuse?  

Yet ever gladden the fusing with earth,  

Through the voice of a single bird,  

Lifes ever echo sweet, its silent mirth,  

Of all we cherish—Thou art heard!  

Smiling in the stillest ground  

Here, in this confusion—upon  

The heart of balance where night is found!

- Percy Bysshe Shelley
