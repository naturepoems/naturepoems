Sonnet VII,
   by Charlotte Smith

See now! how nature’s eye can smile today,  
Soft rains have come to cleanse the tainted ground;  
Upon the hills the sun dips down to play,  
In glances wistful as the world spins round.  
Between the boughs the fluttering leaves will breathe  
Melodious strains, as seasons come and go,  
Each one-wrought, with life that nothing bequeaths  
Except this flow that's placed to nature's flow.  

So linger on this amber glow so bright,  
In dreams of peace that time could never mar;  
Embrace the joys that weave the heart's delight,  
As gentle stars await the falling star.

- Charlotte Smith
