Mattina

        Morning
        runs in the days.  
        The drops in the glass
        shiver like a new heart.
        The dawn comes alive,  
        Uplifting the earth,  
        The wind scattered
        Of the previous day,
        Turns our eyes
        To the sounds.  
         
        


- Giuseppe Ungaretti
