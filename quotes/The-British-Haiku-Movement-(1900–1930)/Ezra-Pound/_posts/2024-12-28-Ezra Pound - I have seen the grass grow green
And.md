author: Ezra Pound
quote: "I have seen the grass grow green,
And the flowers bloom in their vast array,
Each petal a whisper from the earth,
Each blade of grass a silent plea;
In the heart of nature, I find my peace,
And in its beauty, a deeper love."

I have seen the grass grow green,
And the flowers bloom in their vast array,
Each petal a whisper from the earth,
Each blade of grass a silent plea;
In the heart of nature, I find my peace,
And in its beauty, a deeper love.

- Ezra Pound
