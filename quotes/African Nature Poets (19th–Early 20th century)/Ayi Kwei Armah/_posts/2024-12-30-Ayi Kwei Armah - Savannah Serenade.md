In the heart of the savannah, 
    where the sun kisses the earth,
    grasses sway and whisper,
    secrets held by ancient winds.  

The call of the wild, a symphony,
    of lions and leopards,
    as the sun sets, 
    painting the sky in hues of gold, 
    the horizon ablaze with adventure.  

Nature’s magic unfolds,
    as life dances in harmony,
    a celebration of existence,
    rooted deep in the soil, 
    reaching for the stars.
