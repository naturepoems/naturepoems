The river flows, a silver thread,  
Weaving through landscapes where dreams are fed,  
In its gentle current lies the past,  
Whispers of ancestors, echoes that last.

From mountain peaks to valleys low,  
The rhythm of life in the waters' flow,  
Carving its path, steadfast and true,  
Nature's journey, a magnificent view.

- Thomas Mofolo
