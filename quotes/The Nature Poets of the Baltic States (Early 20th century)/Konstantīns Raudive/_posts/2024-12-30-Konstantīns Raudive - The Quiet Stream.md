The Quiet Stream

Flowing softly, gently,
The quiet stream sings,
A lullaby to the stones,
Cradling their ancient wisdom,
Beneath the watchful skies.

Ripples glint in sunlight,
Sparkling like laughter;
The world fades away,
In this serene canvas,
Where solitude becomes a friend.

I sit on the bank,
Engulfed in harmony,
As whispers of water,
Wrap around my soul,
And carry my worries away.

- Konstantīns Raudive
