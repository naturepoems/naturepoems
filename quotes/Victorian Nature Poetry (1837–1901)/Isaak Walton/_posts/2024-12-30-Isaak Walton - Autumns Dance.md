When autumn whispers to the trees,
  With colors bright that grace the boughs,
  The leaves engage in final dance,
  Before they fall, a gentle bow.

The earth dons robes of amber gold,
  And crickets chirp their twilight tune,
  Each moment rich, a story told,
  Beneath the watchful autumn moon.

- Isaak Walton
