In woods where whispers weave a tune,  
Beneath the boughs where shadows play,  
I stand in awe of nature's boon,  
And let my thoughts drift far away.

The rustling leaves, the sun's soft glow,  
Each moment in the wild is rare,  
The tranquil streams and mountain flow  
Remind me of a world so fair.

- Hjalmar Hegner
