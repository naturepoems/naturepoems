LIFE IN THE WOODS

In the woods, life pulses free,
With every scent that drifts and sways,
The laughter of our souls become,
The anthem of the woodland days.

The chatter of the birds above,
The rustling of the leaves aglow,
Here in nature’s holy space,
Our spirits dance, our hearts bestow.

So let us wander hand in hand,
With nature’s path beneath our feet,
In every shade, and every light,
Life in the woods is pure and sweet!

- Lydia Maria Child
