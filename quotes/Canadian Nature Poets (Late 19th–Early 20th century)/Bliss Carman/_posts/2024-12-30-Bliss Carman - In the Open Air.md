IN THE OPEN AIR

I love to wander where the wild  
And welcome wayward wastes to roam,  
Where summer winds are soft and mild,  
And air is filled with a breezy home.

Where all the birds sing high above  
And each sweet call wraps me in song;  
Each note is but a burst of love  
In the woodland air, where I belong.

So come, O summer breeze of blue!  
Come with sweet light and tantalize  
And breathe upon my heart anew  
And with your love-song fill my eyes!


- Bliss Carman
