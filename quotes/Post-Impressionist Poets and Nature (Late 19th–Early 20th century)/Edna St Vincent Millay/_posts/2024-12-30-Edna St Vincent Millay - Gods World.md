God's World

O World, I cannot hold thee close enough!
Thy winds, thy wide gray skies!
Thy mists that hover, and thy bows that cluff
Like tall trees; O I have felt such a scuff
On waters of silver, thy moon blooms high!

Under coat of vivid stars, brilliant there,
I marveled in the frenzy of a weary heart.
O dark heavens shining afar, thine in a pool!

Hearts along the bank in darkness newly dimmed
Can capture the hymn by shelter untamed:
With something of shadow, they trembled at praise.

Now go and walk the gold-tipped shores,
Where love and beauty kiss in the rustling breeze
Of life's ethereal allure.


- Edna St Vincent Millay
