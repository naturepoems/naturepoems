---

All things are connected, my brothers,
The rivers, the mountains, the air,
Each element's pulse, a heartfelt rhythm,
A cycle of loss, love, and care.

Look closely and see the circle,
The pathway that takes us through,
From each blossom that stretches to sunlight,
To the dew that clingsâ€”fresh and new.

Remember the paths that have formed us,
These roots that intertwine each seed,
In unity with nature's great fabric,
So the heart is truly freed.

- Walt Whitman
