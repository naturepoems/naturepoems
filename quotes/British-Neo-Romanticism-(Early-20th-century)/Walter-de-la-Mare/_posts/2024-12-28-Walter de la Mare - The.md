The Rainbow
The rainbow glimmers in the sky, 
  On the edges of shimmering air, 
Where the raindrops scatter and lie, 
  It spins in the breezy prayer. 
In folds it curls, and within its embrace, 
  All the colors that dance and weave; 
Its beauty is an endless chase, 
  A promise of joy to believe.


- Walter de la Mare
