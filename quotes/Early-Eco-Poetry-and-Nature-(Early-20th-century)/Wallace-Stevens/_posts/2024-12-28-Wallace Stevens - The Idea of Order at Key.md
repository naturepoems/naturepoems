The Idea of Order at Key West
She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind
Of man or body, in a more
Than he gave the earth and air.

And the song, if there was any song,
Was lost, in the splendor of the sea.
And when she smiles and sings,
And when I, the poet, in her eyes,
And when the beauty sits in the wind.

For she who had used her essence, hence,
In the mood and matter that had taken
The essence of the night
And carried it toward the element
In which the content finds its form.

The poem is awash in the breathing
Echoes of mountains and their breath,
The ground, the air, the elements
All merge to form a singular presence
In the heart of his thoughts.



The Man with the Blue Guitar
Extraordinary things will happen
to the least of men if they look toward
The life that flows and courses below.
The flow and mass of everything
Will stripe their play in form and light.

The trees grow alive in his hand,
the harmonies within themselves,
Seething against shelter.
They know the air and the sky
the bodies and the heart of the song.

The man with the blue guitar
Has become more than a man,
a vessel of earth and all things,
a lift of the eternal in a world
that moves upon its reverie.

These moments induce reflection
to see the nature which is not ours
the shape of the grain which persists,
and paint the meaning that rises
as radiance from a quiet earth.



The Course of a Particular
The wasted world rolls over other contours,
and the horizon bounces through each fork and twist.
But speak now of trees and snow,
each holly leaf enclosing the cold,
the instinct extinguishing remnants of the day.

The trappings of line and color,
the sickle of moon, dream of sky;
it denotes the grace that unfolds,
these wave rhythms that bind
The vaporous air and crafting light.

New thought returns in the shape of seasons,
The vast horizon that speaks and ensnares
And the knowledge deeper, clearer like a raccoon’s pale,
The truth in the wandering wind,
in the nature of that flash,
we seek the fabric in its seamlessness,
diving into what is left behind.

Thus each breath rests in the center, in which
The universe traces its dreams,
and stillness echoes in the word,
to mark where the earth rumbles
and finds its way to new fragments.



Of Mere Being
The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space,

In the prophet palm as nature’s form,
It was not, it is not, it continues,
The losing of its veils of beauty
Stands in the color of this hour,

The light that rises into the void,
And space out of which the thoughts arise,
the world arriving with the close of day,
the palm stands endlessly still,

An unquiet mind and cerulean sky.
It grips the heart tightly in the shape
Of its being, in the impossibility,
And light as the vermilion dawn unfolds,
the palm stands beyond memory.

- Wallace Stevens
