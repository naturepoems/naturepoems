The Plain Sense of Things

The plain sense of things
Is that the plain sense of things  
Is brave and indefinable where  
The winter alone is the greatest truth
And being in the great precipice,
Like a woman stripped of art.

But melancholy is accepted anyway,
The sight of a thing as a sight of a seed
Always containing memory and awe  
Of the deep perfection of all that was
Hewn green, turning itself to growth.

Recognition, of a perfect blue,
Is something beautiful to realize.
The winter returns, and the head holds up  
Hints of a belief above the head,
A thought exhaled inwardly to beauty.

- Wallace Stevens
