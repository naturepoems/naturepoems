To a Snail

The snail, built like a spiral,
    a cipher,
    is all but a perfect circle.
Decimals, part  of the  surrounding,
    so nice, so true to living!
 Clouds passing over the field,
    moon tending to night,
          how we generally define
    the slopes of minor highways.
    An urge transforms,
        vacationing waves deep in silence.
    The webbed sides of those nails!
    It grips the bottom edge;

    may it stay a while, hiding.
