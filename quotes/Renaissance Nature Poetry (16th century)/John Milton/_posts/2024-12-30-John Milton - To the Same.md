To the Same
More esteemed than simple pleasures, pleasure’s load,
In solemn guise, with music makes inroads,
Let every sound, from every flower and tree,
Echo through nature's choir, 'ere long set free.
The stars shall twinkle, and the breath of storms,
Lift spirits to explore their sacred norms,
And in the silent watch of every night,
The heart takes flight, embracing nature’s light.

- John Milton
