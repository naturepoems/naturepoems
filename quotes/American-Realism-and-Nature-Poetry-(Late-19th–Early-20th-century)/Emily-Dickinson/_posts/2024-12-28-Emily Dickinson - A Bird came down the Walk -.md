A Bird, came down the Walk -  
He did not know I saw -  
He bit an Angle Worm in halves  
And ate the fellow, raw.  

And then he drank a Dew  
From a convenient Grass -  
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall  
To let a Beetle pass -  

He glanced with rapid eyes  
That hurried all abroad -  
They looked like frightened Beads, I thought -  
He stirred his Velvet Head -  

Like one in danger, Cautious  
I offered him a Crumb  
And he unrolled his feathers  
And rowed him softer Home -  

Than Oars divide the Ocean,  
Too silver for a seam -  
Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon,  
Leap, splashless, as they swim -

- Emily Dickinson
