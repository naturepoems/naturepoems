In the twilight of the woods,  
the fireflies ignite the night,  
a constellation alive on earth,  
a miracle born of dark and light.  

With every flicker, stories share  
of love, of loss, of dreams,  
as the stars above reflect  
the beauty of nature's seams,  
a world woven in mystique,  
a tapestry of realities.

- Velimir Khlebnikov
