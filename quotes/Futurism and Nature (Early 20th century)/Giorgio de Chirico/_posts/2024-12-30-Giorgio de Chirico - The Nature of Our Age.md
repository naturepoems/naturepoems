The sun has stepped into the sky,
Like a golden athlete plunging in
To the emerald water of the sea.

The olive groves whisper softly, 
As the wind passes through their leaves,
Singing of distant lands bathed in light.

The mountains, with their timeless peaks, 
Embrace the clouds, like lovers entwined,
And the valleys dance beneath a bright moon.

This is the nature of our age,
Where man and machine become entwined,
In a symphony of progress combined.

- Giorgio de Chirico
