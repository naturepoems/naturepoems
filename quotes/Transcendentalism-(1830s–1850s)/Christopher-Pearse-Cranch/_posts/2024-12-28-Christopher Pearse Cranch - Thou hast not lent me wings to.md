Thou hast not lent me wings to fly,
But made me vulnerable to the sky,
And deep in earthly pain I gladly tread:
My soul knows joy—through nature, spirit-led.

In every bloom of spring, a promise lies—
The whispered hope in every verdant guise,
The sunlight dances on the river's sweep,
Awake my heart, and bids my troubles sleep.

Thus, breathing in the fragrant evening breeze,
The whispering trees, for ancient lives that tease,
Shall all conspire to paint the colors fair,
And nature’s love will sate my deep despair.

I know her heart, I feel her gentle hands,
Resplendent shines the beauty of her lands.

- Christopher Pearse Cranch
