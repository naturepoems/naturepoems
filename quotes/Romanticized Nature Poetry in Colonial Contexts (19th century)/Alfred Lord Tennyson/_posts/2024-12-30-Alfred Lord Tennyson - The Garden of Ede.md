The Garden of Ede
Both field and flood throughout the day
   Were gleaming with the sun,
And yet in hues of morning night
   The garden had begun.

All hours a tender fragrance rose
   And swept across the ways,
With perfumed winds to catch a heart,
   And linger through the days.

The trees, they swing their golden balls,
   A falling of the bloom;
A moment hangs, then breaks a sound,
   And softly fills the gloom.

The brook runs bright between the stones,
   A music of its own;
And still you find me here, at ease,
   In beauty's lovely throne.

So let me wander through the woods,
   Or to the banks of foam;
For all my heart I find you here
   In Nature's wondrous home.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
