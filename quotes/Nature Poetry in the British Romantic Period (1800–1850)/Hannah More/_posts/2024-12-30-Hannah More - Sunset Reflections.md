Oh, sunset glow that paints the sky,
Your shades of purple, gold, and rose,
Remind us all that time must fly,
And beauty fades but gently grows.

As evening drapes the world in grace,
Each shadow dips in tranquil pools,
The earth prepares for night's embrace,
While twilight sings her hushed jewels.

So let us pause and take it in,
This sacred gift of day's farewell;
For in this moment, we shall win,
The peace that every heart can tell.

- Hannah More
