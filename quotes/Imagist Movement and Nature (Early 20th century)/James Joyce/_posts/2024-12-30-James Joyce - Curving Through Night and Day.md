Curving down through night and day,
With echo of the moon,
Let all the star-set skies forsake
A song for me as soon.

For here beneath these emerald trees,
A spirit winds so fine,
A whisper floats on gentle air,
A dance of joy divine.

Embrace of summer holds me fast,
‘Neath skies so jeweled bright,
Forgotten summer’s golden laugh
Beckons dreams at night.

Let whim of dewy fawn now reach
Those wonders wrought in light,
And in the flow of simple days,
Ah! Let this heart take flight.


- James Joyce
