The Song of the Chattahoochee
Out of the hills of Habersham,
Down through the valleys of Hall,
I hurry, amain, to greet the plain
And the sea. I am the Chattahoochee!

And I am the river, strong and free,
My banks are lined with trees and honey-sweet,
And I carry the echoes of the hills,
And the voice of the mountains, deep and fleet.

I stir my waters, the sylvan scene;
And in my depth, the shadows glean
Of leaves, of stone, of the hoot of the owl,
And the breath of the breeze, like a silken cowl.

I am the pulse of the land, a bonded thread,
From the timid brooklets that dance and spread,
To the ocean whence I came, returning clear,
In harmony, in song, with the atmosphere.

- Sidney Lanier
