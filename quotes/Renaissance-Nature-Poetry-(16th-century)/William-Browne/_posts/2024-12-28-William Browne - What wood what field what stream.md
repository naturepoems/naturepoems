What wood, what field, what stream, what flower,
Remains untouched by summer’s hand?
What joy could hide, in nature’s power,
Yet grace us in this sunlit land?

Each leaf a story, each bud a dream,
So fine they paint the world today;
In every shadow, every beam,
Life breathes anew, it finds its way.


- William Browne
