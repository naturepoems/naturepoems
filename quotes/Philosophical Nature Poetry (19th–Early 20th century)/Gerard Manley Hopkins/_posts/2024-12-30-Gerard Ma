The Caged Skylark

As a dare-bell be, a hollow bell,
Low-brewed interface, let off all its salt,
With cosmic chorus as the skylark falls
Upon the seabed, spools versed in miracle.
No guide to battle save the glinting ocean.
Spectate, reflect, crested cliffs hewn as sound,
In dance, were but a moment-deck of gold
Awash in zephyr once named free.
Twist of bottom's bed, close-return to form.

Half-ip and sweeting from a loomed lyre,
Frail earth and sky, loop the mural glass,
What therein whispered springs open on the air,
Transverse as roots of glass—not self but all,
Yet governed by the seal of flourished minds,
These tendrils soar and dip as lark's delight.

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
