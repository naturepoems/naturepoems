The force that through the green fuse drives the flower
Drives my red blood: that drives an angry bough
Nigh my veins red throb, and the sun is a fire
That is time and is father of life; and is death;
           And the night is a rose.

The tree that lifts its boughs high to drink
The light of day, there it grows, there it blocks
The light of day, there it pours its rain asleep;  
There are that grow, and none is lost like a lily.

I am one called a man, and yet not only I do breathe,
It is not in the air to breathe in yet: there is love,
And the wind too cries, from flowers of death.  
Every flower is a moment, and is more than and less 
Than all that the sun awaits. 
           The force that through the green fuse drives the flower.

- Dylan Thomas
