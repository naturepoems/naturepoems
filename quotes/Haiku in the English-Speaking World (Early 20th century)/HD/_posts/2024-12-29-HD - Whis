Clouds gather
above the hills,
a silver mist
that blankets the brow,
and whispers softly
into the night.
The stars emerge,
hidden for a moment,
yet always present,
overshadowed by the dawn.
Upon the earth,
gentle rain falls,
a shower of blessings,
soothing and sweet.
In every droplet,
a story unfolds,
each splash a memory,
each puddle a mirror
to the sky.
