Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction
1. It must be abstract.

2. It must change.

3. It must give pleasure.

And, as we contemplate the trees, the earth,
We can contemplate space where it is free to change,
More than matter, more than body logically 
Making its way to poetry’s better end.

The sky stands beyond the boundaries —
Where the vision of the trees conceived by air
Was different from what it could have been
If it did not know color — if it did not note the color —
Of things unseen regarding the trees.

- Wallace Stevens
