The Trees

What is the sea?  
A number of trees!  
What is the sea?  
It is a number of trees  
Stripped to the heart,  
Stripped to the core,  
Belching out their wave  
That crowded us,  
With all the lovers' lips.  
These trees are misty  
And out from them blows  
A little cloud  
Of sobs and hiccups  
Like the moon's own fur.  
So we find ourselves bundled  
In the moony smoke,  
Between the trees  
Where they disappear from sight,  
And like the woogies  
Of the woodland come again,  
Come to the heart,  
With the heart-strings tightened  
In our hands,  
Play with us in the mist.

â€” D.H. Lawrence
