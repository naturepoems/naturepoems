as fragile as a dream,
bare branches woven with ice,
a silent symphony cascades,
beauty rests upon every surface,
a crisp reminder of stillness found."

Winter's breath sketches lacework,
as fragile as a dream,
bare branches woven with ice,
a silent symphony cascades,
beauty rests upon every surface,
a crisp reminder of stillness found.

- Marianne Moore
