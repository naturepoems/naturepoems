quote: "Dawn  
    The dawn creeps gently over the hills,  
    A blush spreads softly like a sigh,  
    The world wakes slow and still,  
    Underneath a sunlit sky.  

    The birds stir in their nest,  
    Their songs rise in sweet refrain,  
    Each note—a lover’s quest,  
    A promise of love to sustain."

Dawn  
    The dawn creeps gently over the hills,  
    A blush spreads softly like a sigh,  
    The world wakes slow and still,  
    Underneath a sunlit sky.  

    The birds stir in their nest,  
    Their songs rise in sweet refrain,  
    Each note—a lover’s quest,  
    A promise of love to sustain.
