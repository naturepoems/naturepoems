The Earth

Deep and knowing, the earth awaits,
With roots that bind and the pulse it creates;
In the embrace of the soil, life springs anew,
Nature’s connecting thread binding me to you.

In the shadow of mountains, streaming creeks’ tunes,
The earth sings to us under sun and moon;
With every heartbeat, with every sweet breath,
We join in the rhythm, transcending death.
