The Wild Flower’s Song

I will rise up in lovely
  Silence of the night!
While the silence shall be so lovely!
  Nettles shall surround me,

I mean to be so brave,
  I mean to be so lovely,
Like the starry night!
  Like a lovely night, like night!

So that shall I rise up,
  So I shall not stand so quietly,
And when the silence, once so lovely,
  Is thicketed with green!

- D H Lawrence
