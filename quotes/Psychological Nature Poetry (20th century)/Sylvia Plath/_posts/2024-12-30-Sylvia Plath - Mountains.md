The mountains rise like whispers,
  Cloaked in the gray of mood,
  They beckon gently, promising peace,
  As shadows traverse the valleys below.
  In their arms, I find escape,
  The bending of time, too still.
  Crisp air fills my lungs,
  I lose myself to the quiet,
  A simple offering of solace.

- Sylvia Plath
