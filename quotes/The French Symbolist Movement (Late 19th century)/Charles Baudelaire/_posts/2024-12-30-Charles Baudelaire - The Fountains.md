The Fountains

Amid the fountain's pearly spray,
With abrupt sunlit bronze laid way,
We wander, and in the time's secret little shrine,
Bathe the bride of the moon's design.

To possess, my love, every atom's flow,
Each droplet jeweled in the sun's radiance,
'Twixt joy and anguish, as the evening glows,
We sink back deeper into fading nuances.


- Charles Baudelaire
