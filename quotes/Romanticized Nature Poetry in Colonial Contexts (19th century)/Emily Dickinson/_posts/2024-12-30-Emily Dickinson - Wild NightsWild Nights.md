Wild Nights—Wild Nights!  
Were I with thee  
Wild Nights should be  
Our luxury!  

With a Beacon in the Sea  
Might I but moor—  
Tonight—  
In thee!  

How I would spread,  
In the Storm,  
The Sail, and then,  
With you—  
Gentle wind blown,  
Could find one—home!  

*Wild Nights—Wild Nights!*

- Emily Dickinson
