On the Ouse
Here by the river, a solemn tread,  
In hues of dusk where whispers rest;  
The echoes linger on, though said,  
In this gentle muse I find my best.

Cool breezes weave through the woven green,  
Chasing shadows upon the ground;  
Where every rustle of nature’s scene,  
Brings solace as sweet thoughts abound.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
