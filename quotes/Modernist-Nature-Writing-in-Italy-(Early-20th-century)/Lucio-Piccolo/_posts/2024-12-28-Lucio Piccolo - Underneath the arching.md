Underneath the arching boughs,
where the sunlight trembles,
there blooms a world unseen,
where blossoms hide their laughter.

Each petal, a story inscribed
in the softest hue of spring;
as beyond the curtain of leaves,
the fauna dances its age-old waltz.

I breathe the earthy scent,
a tapestry woven of birth and decay,
and every sound, every silence,
a rhythm of life unwound by the sun.

When the twilight arrives,
with it comes the serenade,
a symphony of whispers,
a union of the dusk and dawn,
an echo that cradles the heart,
repeating promises made under stars.

- Lucio Piccolo
