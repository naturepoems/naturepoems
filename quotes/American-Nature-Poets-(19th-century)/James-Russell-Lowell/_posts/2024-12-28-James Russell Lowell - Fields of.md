Fields of Peace
In fields where golden grain does sway,
   The heart finds peace anew,
Where daisies bloom and larks sing gay,
   In every varied hue.

The earth extends her arms so wide,
   With every green and gold,
An endless path where we can bide,
   And watch the world unfold.


- James Russell Lowell
