Wander the city in the golden hour,
Where silence reigns and joy abounds,
Touch the earth with the hand of power,
Whisper the names of ancient grounds.

For flowers bloom in the cracks of stone,
And nature calls with a sultry breath,
No heart shall feel the weight of alone,
In these moments that dance on the edge of death.

- Francis Jammes
