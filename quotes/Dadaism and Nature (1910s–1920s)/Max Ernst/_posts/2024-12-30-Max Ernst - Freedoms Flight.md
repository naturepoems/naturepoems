A bird flutters,
   wings woven with dreams,
  across the tapestry of
     forgotten skies.

   Here lies a world,
     unshackled from reason,
         where freedom sways in
   the branches of thought,
       alighting on the unknown.

      The universe collapses,
           only to be born,
       in the next breath.

- Max Ernst
