Amongst the trees where ancient silence reigns,  
I wander free, entwined with Nature’s voice;  
Each rustling leaf a story that it gains,  
In harmony, my heart begins to rejoice.  

The scent of moss, the crispness of the air,  
Infuses life into each wistful thought;  
In Nature’s glow, I find I am laid bare,  
Rebirth and solace, soul—a lesson taught.
