Whispers of twilight,
Soft whispers in woods,
Curling with shadows,
As weariness broods.
The murmur of evenings
As night-blooming sighs,
Chasing the daystar
From the whispering skies.

I wander in darkness,
Through ferns by the creek,
And search for the echoes
Of the lost that I seek.
But when the moon rises,
With beams pure and bright,
The world takes a breath
And envelops in light.

- Emily Carr
