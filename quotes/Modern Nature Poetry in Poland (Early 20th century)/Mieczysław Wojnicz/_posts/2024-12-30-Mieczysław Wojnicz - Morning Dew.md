Morning Dew
Awake the dawn, a silver thread,
With jewels strewn where footsteps tread,
Each drop a star, each blade a dream,
The world awakens, pure and clean.

Through glades where whispers softly play,
Nature unfolds in bright array,
Together with the sun's warm kiss,
We find the path to simple bliss.

- Mieczysław Wojnicz
