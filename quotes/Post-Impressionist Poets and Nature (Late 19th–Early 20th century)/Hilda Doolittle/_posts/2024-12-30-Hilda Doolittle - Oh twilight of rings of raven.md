Oh twilight of rings of raven, 
I walk the hoary foliage, listening.
The buzzing murmurs, 
Grow bitter in the drunks—
Yet how the trees shall split! 
I shall meet them with sugar glossed,   
In visions bearing sight, 
With tenderness their fray, how still,
Still am I gaining years, oh shapeless ghost?
Of life, like those old stages hath blown, 
The flinging beauty roasted ott, 
I cleave to my misted sky.  
Tell me there is no waste among the elders— 
Where the bubbling shall rend— 
A wild wild soul— to grow a glow 
In eclipsed rhythms of this tree.

- Hilda Doolittle
