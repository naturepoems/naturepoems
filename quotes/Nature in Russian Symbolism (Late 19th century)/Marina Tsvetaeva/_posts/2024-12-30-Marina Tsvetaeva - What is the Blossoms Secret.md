What is the blossom's secret,
That draws my spirit ever near?
In petals soft, like whispered dreams,
Where fragrance mingles with the dear.
Each flower holds a sacred story,
Of sunlight, rain, and tender care,
In the garden, where time bends softly,
Natureâ€™s magic woven rare.
The insects dance like fleeting thoughts,
While colors splash the silence pale,
In the heart of fragrant bloom,
Eternal love tells its tale.

- Marina Tsvetaeva
