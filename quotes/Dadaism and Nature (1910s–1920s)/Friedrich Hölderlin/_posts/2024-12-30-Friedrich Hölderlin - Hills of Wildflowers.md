Upon the hills where wildflowers bloom,  
Nature sings a lilting tune,  
The earth adorned in vibrant hues,  
Embracing the sweetness of the afternoon.
  
And by the brook, where waters glide,  
The laughter echoes, young and free,  
In celebration of life, we bide,  
Entwined with nature, eternally.


- Friedrich Hölderlin
