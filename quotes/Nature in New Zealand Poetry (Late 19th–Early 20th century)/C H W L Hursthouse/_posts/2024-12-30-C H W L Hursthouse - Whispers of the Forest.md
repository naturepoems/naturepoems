Whispers of the Forest

Deep in the forest, shadows dwell,
Where ancient secrets softly swell.
The trees, they whisper tales of old,
Of wild adventures, brave and bold.

In dappled light, the ferns unfold,
A tapestry rich, in greens and gold.
The quiet hum of life surrounds,
In every burrow, in every sound.

With every step on mossy floor,
One finds the magic, forevermore.
So pause and listen—hear the call—
Nature's spirit connecting us all.
