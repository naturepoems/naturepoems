for the delight

the rain brings
as it touches

the face of the earth—

a moment's pause
and the sun breaks through

for an instant's warming touch."

There are no measures
for the delight

the rain brings
as it touches

the face of the earth—

a moment's pause
and the sun breaks through

for an instant's warming touch.
