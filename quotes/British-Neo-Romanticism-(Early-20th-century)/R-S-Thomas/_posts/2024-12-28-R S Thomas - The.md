The Nightingale

The nightingale sings  
beyond the lenses,  
     where softer shadows slide,
     and the echo fades.
   
O beauty of gold,  
counted in the garden,  
your feathered eyes  
have seen  
like none of man 
before you left,  
an unwritten tune,  
of spaces  
     and the dark,  
held by the growth of night.

- R S Thomas
