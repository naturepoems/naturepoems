The river’s path is winding, true,
A mirror for the passing sun.
And like the flow that carries through,
It binds my heart, two souls as one.

In nature's arms, I find my grace,
Where the waters splash and roll,
And in this rhythmic, sacred space,
I listen to the river's soul.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
