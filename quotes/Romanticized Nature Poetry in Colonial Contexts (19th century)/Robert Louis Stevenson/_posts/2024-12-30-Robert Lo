The Rainbow

Green, blue, and gold, in a violet hue,
   And every shade that swells,
To burn on high in a sky so blue,
   And tell the world, that dwells,

In countless colors by man's hand,
   The rainbow nature's work,
That rises high in the beauty grand,
   As all things here may lurk.


- Robert Louis Stevenson
