The woods are calm, the air is still,  
With silence all around;  
Each leaf that quakes, on every hill,  
Finds peace in whispered sound.

A distant call from mockingbird  
Doth fill the air with cheer;  
While shadows blend with twilight heard,  
To seal the night so near.

What gentle calm comes over me,  
In Nature's tranquil breath;  
While all her joys set my soul free,  
To capture life in depth.

Oh sweet the blooms that capture flame,  
With colors rapt in view;  
May I return, in nature's name,  
Forever true to you.
