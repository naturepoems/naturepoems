In the heart of the wood, as the sun dips low,
A dance of the shadows where soft breezes blow.
The whispering leaves in a gentle embrace,
Nature's own hand paints a delicate space.

The brook babbles secrets, as old as the stars,
Its journey a song, a tale of its scars.
With each turn and twist, it carves out a soul,
In the rhythm of silence, the forest feels whole.

Ah, the mountains that rise like guardians bold,
Wrapped in the mystery that silence unfolds.
They speak to the clouds, and the cosmos does sigh,
In the majesty echoing, ever so high.

And when twilight descends with a purple hue,
The canvas of heaven, splashed deep with gold hue.
The nightingale sings through the veil of the night,
As whispers of dreams ripple soft in the light.

Such grandeur surrounds, in each leaf, every stone,
In the breath of the earth, we are never alone.
Embrace these realms where the spirit runs free,
In nature's sweet arms, find your harmony.

- H V Morton
