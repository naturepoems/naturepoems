The Mountain

The mountain stands, a sentinel of dreams,
Where time and space collide in sacred rite,
It wears the cloak of nature’s purest schemes,
And in its depths reside both day and night.
Eternal witness to the world’s great plight,
The mountain knows the secrets of the heart,
In its embrace, I find life’s true delight,
As whispers of the ancients play their part.

- Richard Aldington
