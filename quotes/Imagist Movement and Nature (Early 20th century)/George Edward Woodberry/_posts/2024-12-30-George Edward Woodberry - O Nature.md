O nature! thou art rich in more
Than all the gilded dreams of man;
Thy rivers dance, thy breezes soar,
Thy melodies, a sweetened plan.

In every leaf, in every flower,
A voice of hope, a tale of old,
Forever sings through this earthâ€™s hour,
And whispers sweet the love untold.

- George Edward Woodberry
