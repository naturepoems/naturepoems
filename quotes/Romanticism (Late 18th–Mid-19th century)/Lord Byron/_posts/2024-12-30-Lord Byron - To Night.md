And thou, West Wind,  
Wild spirit, thou,  
Who charr'd the world, the tornado floods,  
Dost thou know  
Why I languish beneath that spark?  
That I would weave tangible dreams  
From snow-wreathed boughs.

And be it known,  
From the world of trees, the restless hours!  
Howe’er I may wander,  
Then it be softly told,  
I will travel quick as a bird.  
It matters not the shore;  
My heart shall roam where the wildflowers grow.

- Lord Byron
