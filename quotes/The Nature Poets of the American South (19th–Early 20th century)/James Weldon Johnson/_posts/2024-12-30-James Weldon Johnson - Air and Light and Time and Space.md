Air and Light and Time and Space

I knew a man who was a poet,  
And he was a poet in a very unusual way—  
He wove his words like a web of dreams,  
And spun them down like sunlight rays.  

He painted portraits of the past,  
And depicted skies of azure blue;  
With every stroke of his brush,  
Life sprung forth, anew.  

He sang of air and light and time,  
Of gentle streams and winds that blow;  
He captured visions of noonday sun,  
And whispered secrets only nature knows.


- James Weldon Johnson
