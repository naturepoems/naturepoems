The Night

Oh, shroud of twilight, blissfully dense,  
Enfold me in dreams, from the world’s pretense;  
The stars, they blink with a winking smile,  
Spill silver dew as they linger awhile.

In the cool embrace where shadows creep,  
Every sigh of the night, the earth’s secrets keep;  
Whispered notes of the nightingale weave,  
Through velvet darkness, it dares to believe.

Let the night carry our worries and fears,  
In her tender arms, we drown our tears;  
For within the veil, the heart learns to fight,  
And rage against sorrow until morning light.

- Charles Baudelaire
