Autumn's Whisper
Leaves ablaze in fiery dance,
a waltz of gold, a vivid trance,
underfoot, a crackling song,
a carpet rich, where I belong.

The crisp air carries scents of change,
as nature dons her robe of strange,
with every rustle, soft and low,
a whisper of winter, soon to show.

In this mosaic, I glean the call,
the beauty fleeting, yet lingering tall,
a reminder that seasons fade away,
yet in their cycles, we find our way.


- Thomas S P S Munch
