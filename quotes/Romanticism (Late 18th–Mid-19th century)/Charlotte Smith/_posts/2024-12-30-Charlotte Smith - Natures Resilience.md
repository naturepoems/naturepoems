Alas! the winds do moan, the boughs do weep,  
For Time hath caught them in his ruthless snare;  
But Nature’s voice, through sorrow’s tear-stained sleep,  
Still sings of joy beyond her dark despair.  

Let not the heart be frail beneath the storm;  
For every tempest brings the sun anew;  
In Nature’s muse, find courage, strength, and warm  
A world of beauty stemming from your view.

- Charlotte Smith
