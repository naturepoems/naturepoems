Whenever spring bursts the chains of winter,
I walk beneath the flowering trees,
With petals like soft whispers around me,
Their fragrance floating: the sweetest tease.

And who could measure the beauty of a day,
When laughter of children fills the air,
And the gardens bloom in extravagant array,
While love certainly, blooms everywhere?

- Francis Jammes
