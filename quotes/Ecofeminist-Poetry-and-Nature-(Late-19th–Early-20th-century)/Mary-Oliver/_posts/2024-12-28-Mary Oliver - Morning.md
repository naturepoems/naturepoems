Morning Poem

Every morning
I walk out into the world
alone.
I begin with a blessing.

I will take this day to be true
and good,
to be gentle,

and this is all I want,
and the full sky of summer
with its colors and promises,

rests on me.
I could break open,
become joy.

So I take this moment,
and carry it, and great multitudes 
stand around me,

and I am blessed.
