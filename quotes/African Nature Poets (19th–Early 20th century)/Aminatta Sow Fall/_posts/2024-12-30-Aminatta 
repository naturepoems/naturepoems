The wildflowers paint the meadow,
With strokes of yellow, blue, and red,
In a tapestry of color,
As nature’s canvas spreads.

Honeybees hum their praises,
In the warmth of the sun’s embrace,
Each bloom a celebration,
In this sacred, open space.

Here the heart beats louder,
In the symphony of creation,
As I wander through this wonder,
And find my own salvation.
