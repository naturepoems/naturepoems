Beneath the vast expanse of stars, 
    we are but echoes, 
    carried by the winds of time, 
    lost in the universe, 
    yet found in the embrace of the earth.  

Each night unveils a story, 
    woven in cosmic threads, 
    and as we gaze skyward, 
    our hearts connect, 
    to the pulse of existence.  

Let us walk the pathways of dreams, 
    guided by the moon’s soft glow, 
    as we dance among the stars, 
    forever grateful for this journey, 
    for this beautiful chaos called life.
