In the heart of the forest deep,
Where shadows play and secrets keep,
Leaves whisper tales of times gone by,
And rivers laugh as they slip by.

The ferns uncurl, the wildflowers bloom,
Nature’s palette, dispelling gloom.
Each path we take, a story told,
In sunlight’s warmth, in winter’s cold.

- Lytton Strachey
