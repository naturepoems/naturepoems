Evening

                    The softest light now graces earth,
                    As shadows weave their silent cheer,
                    To settle into evening’s birth,
                    The world becomes most calm and clear.
                    
                    In quiet bites of dusk’s embrace,
                    I listen to the night-time hymn,
                    The wind’s cool fingers play and trace,
                    Each gentle wisp and evanescent whim.
                    
                    Through every leaf that catches dew,
                    Is nature’s love, a balm so sweet,
                    Each moment shared, in dark, renew,
                    For every heartbeat feels complete.
