Of Mere Being

The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space.

The palm stands on the edge of space
And brings with it the singular resolution,
With all its leaves that symbolize
Across the waters of the world
A life expectancy.

For in the weight of being and being:
Its earthen mystery is drawn
To the edge of the leaves,
Where the wind goes on.



- Wallace Stevens
