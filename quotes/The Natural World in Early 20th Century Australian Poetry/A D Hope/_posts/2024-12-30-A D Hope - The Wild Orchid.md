The Wild Orchid
In shadows deep where sunlight steals,  
Among the ferns, a treasure shy,  
An orchid blooms, and nature heals,  
To touch the earth, its spirit fly.

Though lost in quiet, hidden space,  
Its colors weave a story rare,  
And paint the leaves with delicate grace,  
As dreams unfold in fragrant air.

Each blossom tells a tale anew,  
Of life that dares to bloom and thrive,  
Abiding where the wild winds blew,  
To find its place and stay alive.
