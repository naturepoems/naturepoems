In the Meadow

There is a meadow where the daisies bloom,
And sunshine weaves through branches like a loom;
I wander there on days that drift and flow,
In the quiet of the place where the wild things grow.

The whispering grass beneath my bare feet,
The laughter of the brook is sweet and fleet;
I hear the calling of the lonesome dove,
And in that meadow, I find my truest love.

- Sara Teasdale
