a fabric of echoes dancing in the air,
it weaves the moments between heartbeats,
a serenade carried on dreams of the fair."

The nightingale's song threads through the twilight glow,
a fabric of echoes dancing in the air,
it weaves the moments between heartbeats,
a serenade carried on dreams of the fair.
