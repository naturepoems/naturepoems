The Trees
The trees lift their heads in the air,
Spread their boughs on the wind,
Stretch out their limbs in the sun,
Bending and bowing, each in its own way.
The strength of their trunks speaks
Of the storms they have weathered,
Of the promises of spring that call through the earth.

- Andrew Jackson Downing
