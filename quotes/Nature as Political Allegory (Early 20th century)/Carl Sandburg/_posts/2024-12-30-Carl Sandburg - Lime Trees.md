Lime trees,
Mighty lime trees
Heavy with bloom,
Fill the air
With dusky sweetness.

When the summer night
Comes down,
With its heavy warmth,
And the dark trees
grow thick and tangled,
I would but linger,
With my heart in hand,
To lie under the lime trees,
And hear the whispered stories
Of the night.

- Carl Sandburg
