Sky

O Sky!  
What riches in your jets,  
Unfathomable depth!  
Each blue a dream,  
Each cloud a thought,  
Each star a longing  
Tethered to the heart,  
A dance—a story untold.

You cradle all nature,  
Waves of thought that rise  
And find their solace  
In the wind's perfect flight,  
While lost in the endless flow  
Of the mystic evening tide  
That laps upon the shore of time.

— D.H. Lawrence
