Childe Harold's Pilgrimage

There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
There is society, where none intrudes,
By the deep sea, and music in its roar;
I love not Man the less, but Nature more,

From these our interviews, in which I steal
From all I may be, or have been before,
To mingle with the Universe, and feel
What I can never express, yet cannot all conceal.






And I have felt a presence that disturbs me
With the joy of elevated thoughts; The earth
Is like a consciousness, set free from all dim sense.
A deeper shade of blessings, by my side,
Echoing the light of anguish in a claim,
This bond, which is above even nature; 
To thee is a fervid stemâ€”
To thee!

- Lord Byron
