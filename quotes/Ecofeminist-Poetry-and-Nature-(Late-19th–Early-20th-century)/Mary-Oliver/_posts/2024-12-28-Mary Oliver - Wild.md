Wild Geese

You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.

You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.
Tell me about your despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.

Meanwhile the world goes on.
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes,

over the prairies and the deep trees,
by the rivers of the wind,
and in the mountains there is a river,

that never stops. There is a river that goes,
out to the sea, the birds in the sky
and the animals everywhere.

By the body that is inside you,
because we are all together in it.
You only have to let the world go on,

You only have to let the wild geese,
get what they want.
