The Vale of Avoca

There is not a stream in the world so dear,
So sweet as the Avoca’s crystal clear,
With its banks adorned with flowers and green,
And a scene that enchants like a magical dream.

O well do I love the whispering breeze,
That bathes the vale in a soft, sweet ease;
And the echoing hills that in grandeur rise,
With the beauty of nature, they pierce the skies.

Let me wander there along its fair flow,
Where the heart feels at peace and the spirit doth glow.
For in every ripple the songs of the past,
Shall echo forever and with me hold fast.

—Felicia Hemans
