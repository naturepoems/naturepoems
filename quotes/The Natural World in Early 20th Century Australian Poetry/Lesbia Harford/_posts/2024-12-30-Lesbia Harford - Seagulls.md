Seagulls

To the spread of their wings, above the surf—  
The cries of the seagulls  
Are hovering over the breeze,  
Far Huon, where life breaks and tears,  
Their screams of the natural sound  
Compatible upon the brow of Heaven!  
Oh, when it flies!  
Its construction—perfect in the slip!  
As I stand and gaze at its flight,  
I wonder—what joy to live, above the world!
