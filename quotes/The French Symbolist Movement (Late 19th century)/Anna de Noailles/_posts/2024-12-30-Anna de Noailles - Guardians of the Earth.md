Mountains stand tall, guardians of the earth,
Their majesty cloaked in whispers of cloud;
Nature breathes deeply, cradling her children,
In valleys where dreams cradle the ground.

A prayer rises with the morning mist,
As rivers rush with the stories of life;
In the heart of the wild, we find our home,
Eternally tugged by natureâ€™s call.

- Anna de Noailles
