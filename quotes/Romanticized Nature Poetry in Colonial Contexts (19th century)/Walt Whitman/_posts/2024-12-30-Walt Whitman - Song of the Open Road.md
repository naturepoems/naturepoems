Afoot and light-hearted, I take to the open road,
Healthy, free, the world before me,
The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.
Henceforth I ask not good fortuneâ€” I myself am good fortune; 
Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more,
Need nothing, 
Except the access to my own better-being.

- Walt Whitman
