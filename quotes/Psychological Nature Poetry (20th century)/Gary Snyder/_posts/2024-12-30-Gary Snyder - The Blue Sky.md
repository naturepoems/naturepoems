The Blue Sky

An ocean lifted itself,
Cradled by mountains,
Where the blue sky swells,
Time stretches, sings,
And prays to the wind.
Climb beyond the grey,
To touch the expanse of words
That braided the crux of existence.
All things breathe,
Every bright feather curling and rising,
To reach the spirit of the dawn,
Where fields are green,
And the gold breaks under trees, 
Hold a weight of ancient songs...
The blue sky speaks through other forms,
It spans above, the roots of meaning.
Give your ear to natureâ€™s cry.
Light it,"nature will listen.

- Gary Snyder
