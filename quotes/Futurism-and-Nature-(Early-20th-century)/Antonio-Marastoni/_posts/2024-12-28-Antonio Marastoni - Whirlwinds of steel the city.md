Whirlwinds of steel, the city bright,
Yet, a whispering brook still weaves,
Soft shadows cast in morning light,
Where silence lives and nature grieves.

With every heartbeat, earth ignites,
Concrete fades to soft-spun dreams,
In living colors, nature writes,
A tale of hope, beyond extremes.

- Antonio Marastoni
