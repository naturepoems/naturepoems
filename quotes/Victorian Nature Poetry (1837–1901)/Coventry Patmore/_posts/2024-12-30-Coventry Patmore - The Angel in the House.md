The Angel in the House

I. Woman
a
a
She was a creature bright and pure as air,  
Endowed with graces that from Heaven,  
In birds and flowers and rivers flow aspired  
To tread the earthy ground, until  
On some fond heart  
Thou art pure Love, rooted and shy,  
Rooted  in the hidden center of the earth  
And fairest blossom of the flower therein.  

II. Serenity

I slept, and the hours fled softly by,  
Knitting their gleaming threads of gold.  
I dreamed, and the world seemed thus to lie,  
Gentled by the memories of old.  

Let morning’s first bright rays unfold  
The story written on the earth;  
Let sweet winds whisper and all hearts behold  
The brightening of a world anew.  

III. The Folly of Fame

To seek for honor in the world’s slough;  
Where fortune reigns with hands of pride  
This gilded triumph only knows to cow  
The heart that wore honest truth inside.  

For in the hidden joys of every hour  
Is worth much sweeter than on thrones above;  
The heart of fame doth fade, yet still the flower  
That blooms in quiet is a charm of love.
