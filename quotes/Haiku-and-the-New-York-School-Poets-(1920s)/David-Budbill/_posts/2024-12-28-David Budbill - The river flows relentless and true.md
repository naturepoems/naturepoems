quote: "The river flows, relentless and true,  
Worn stones glisten, stories of time,  
I watch life navigate,  
Each bend a new journey,  
Lessons in the current's embrace."

The river flows, relentless and true,  
Worn stones glisten, stories of time,  
I watch life navigate,  
Each bend a new journey,  
Lessons in the current's embrace.
