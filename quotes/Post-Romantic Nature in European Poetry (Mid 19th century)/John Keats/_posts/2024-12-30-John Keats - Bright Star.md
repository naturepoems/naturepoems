Bright star! would I were steadfast as thou art—
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like nature’s patient, sleepless Eremite,

Thee, in whose existence in this world
Whatever, is, made from life and rules the heart.
For, were thou silent once, we would be told
Our duty is, for love would not depart.

— Bright Star

- John Keats
