Blossoms
****** a tree once blossomed!  
Flares of colors burst like themes,  
Carving secret keys that chirp, pastel truths,  
Stealing whatever dawn showcases.
 
Vastness like velvet hued integrals-  
Are molded differently,  
Repeating all dreams through whispers of balmy night!  \n

- Vladimir Mayakovsky
