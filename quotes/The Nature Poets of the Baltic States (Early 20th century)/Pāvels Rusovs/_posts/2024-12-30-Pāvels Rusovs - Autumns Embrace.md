As autumn paints the forests,
With hues of amber and gold,
Leaves drift like memories,
Carried off by the gentle breeze,
In the tapestry of the cycle.

Every rustle speaks of change,
Of the earth preparing to rest,
A reminder of life’s flow,
And as nature wanes softly,
Her spirit prepares to renew.
