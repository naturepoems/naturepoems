a soft percussion upon leaves,  
it stirs the hidden roots,  
awakening life below,  
tiny miracles drawn up,  
a chorus of green in the dawn."

The gentle rain falls,  
a soft percussion upon leaves,  
it stirs the hidden roots,  
awakening life below,  
tiny miracles drawn up,  
a chorus of green in the dawn.
