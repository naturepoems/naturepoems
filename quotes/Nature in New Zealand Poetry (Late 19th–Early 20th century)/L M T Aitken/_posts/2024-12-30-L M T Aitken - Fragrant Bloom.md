O fragrant bloom, in tepid air,
   Thy petals brightly gleam and glow;
With perfume wafted everywhere,
   Thou art the joy of all below.

In springtime's flush, when hope is high,
   Thy hues impart a fragrant cheer;
Sweet flower of love, beneath the sky,
   Wilt thou not linger ever near?


- L M T Aitken
