Summer Rain
A gentle patter sings on the leaves,
Summer rain weaves songs that the heart believes.
Dripping nectar drops, a fragrant delight,
Embracing each petal, a lover's soft bite.

The earth breathes deep, soaking in the grace,
Colors awaken in this warm embrace.
Nature rejoices, her thirst now quelled,
In the dance of the raindrops, serenity dwelled.

- Alexei Kruchyonykh
