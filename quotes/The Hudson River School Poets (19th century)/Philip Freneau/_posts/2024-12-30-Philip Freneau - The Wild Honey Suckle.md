The Wild Honey Suckle

Fair flower, that dost so comely grow,
Hid in the silent vale,

Thou art the sweetest, the fairest, the fairest show,
That I as yet may hail.

Sugar canst thou gather, or dew,
And now a blossom all of a hue:

Yet in season's motions, through all thy changing,
Thrice welcome, beautiful flower! from thrice weeping.

Thus teaching my heart the whispering joy,
A sweetly-humorous sender of my thoughts.


- Philip Freneau
