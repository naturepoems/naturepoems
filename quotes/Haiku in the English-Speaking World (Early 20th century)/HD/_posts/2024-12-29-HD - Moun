The mountains loom,
a fortress of time,
a memory of earth
held in the stillness,
a reminder of strength.
As clouds gather,
a tapestry unfolds,
a dance of shadows,
a play of textures,
a canvas stretched wide,
where the heavens meet
the uplifted land.
In this sacred silence,
a prayer takes root,
a call to remember
the beauty in solidarity.
