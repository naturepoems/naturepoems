The Great Figure  

Among the rain  

and lights  

I saw the figure  

5  

in gold  

on a red  

fire truck  

moving  

tense  

with the  

shattering  

distant sirens  

moaning  

over the black  

and white  

of the clouded scene  

cold from rain  

and the yellow  

luminous fire  

expanding through the night  

so much  

depends  

upon  

a red wheel  

barrow  

beside the white  

chickens.

- William Carlos Williams
