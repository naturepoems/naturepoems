The Sea

A fierce tide rises,
tugging at the landâ€™s grip,
as waves carve the coast,
shaping the world in shadows.

Each crest a dance of fury,
each trough a moment of pause,
as the sea sings its song,
shattering the stillness of time.

Here, the sun hits the surface
like a lover,
tender yet unapologetic,
flashing diamonds across the waters.

In the depth lies mystery,
a realm where silence reigns,
lost in the embrace of water,
as the heart of nature
beats with rhythm profound.
