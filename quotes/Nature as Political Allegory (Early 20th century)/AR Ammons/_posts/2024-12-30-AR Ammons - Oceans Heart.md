As I stand before the ocean,
each wave a messenger of the deep,
I feel the heart of the wild pulsing,
a rhythm that speaks of boundlessness,
a tapestry of skies sewn to earth.

In the foamâ€™s caress, I glimpse
the vastness of existence,
a dance that wraps us all,
where the salty kiss of freedom flows,
and the horizon beholds each promise made.
