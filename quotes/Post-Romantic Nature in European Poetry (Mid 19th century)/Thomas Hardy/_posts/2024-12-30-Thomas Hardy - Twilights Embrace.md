A drizzling fog creeps low to earth,
The light is dim, the twilight birthed,
Each step I take is softened still,
Yet echoes linger, as dreams fulfill.

The moon's pale face peeks through the mist,
Where shadows dance, and dreams exist,
In this ghostly hour, enchantments found,
A mystic world where hearts resound.

- Thomas Hardy
