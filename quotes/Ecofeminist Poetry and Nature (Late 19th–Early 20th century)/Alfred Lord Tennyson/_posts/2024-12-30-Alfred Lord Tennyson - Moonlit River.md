Beneath the moonlight, soft and pale,
The river murmurs a tender tale,
Of rippling waves and drifting dreams,
And love's sweet secrets in silver gleams.
Life flows gentle, like water's kiss,
Kissing the shores of nature's bliss,
Where all is peace, and fear takes flight,
In the serenity of the star-studded night.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
