A Supermarket in California

What thoughts I have of you tonight, Walt Whitman,
   for I walked down the sidestreets under the trees
     with a headache self-conscious looking at the sky
          and looking at the streets,
And all the lonely men I met . . .
   I love you, I love you, West Coast,
     out of the east.

I saw you standing at the counter of a fast food deli
     waiting to be served something hot and sweet,
And I looked at your face in the lights.

I thought about your poems, how you crossed the valley,
   thought of the great thoughts you conceived
      and how the wind blows out here
          as well as you
            as you stepped out once again.

I saw you go home and saw the sunset burning
    across the ocean and headed into the west
          luminous and glittering as a tooth
             in a smile.
