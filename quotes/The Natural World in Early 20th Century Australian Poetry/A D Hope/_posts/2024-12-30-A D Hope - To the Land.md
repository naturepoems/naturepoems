To the Land
O land of ancient green and gold,  
Where rugged hills clutch light with grace,  
With every story long retold,  
You cradle hopes in your embrace.

Though man may tread upon your skin,  
Your heart beats strong beneath our feet,  
The songs of earth, a whisper thin,  
Awaken life where silence greets.

So let us roam among your paths,  
Where nature speaks in sacred tongue,  
And find within your silent swaths,  
The tale of all our hearts have sung.
