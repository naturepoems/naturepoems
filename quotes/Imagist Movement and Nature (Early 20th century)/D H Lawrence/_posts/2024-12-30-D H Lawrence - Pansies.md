Pansies

           There is no end of longing
           The flowers are a mad lot,
           they terrify me.
           They are not made for the soil,
           they are made for the sweet air.
           See how deep the blue is, see how tragic.
           I have to suffer from the bright wishes of morning,
           pale stars of pansy, purple-yellow,

- D H Lawrence
