Mountains stand as ancient shields,
Witnesses to the changing years,
Their peaks crowned with snow and dreams,
Whispering tales of laughter, tears.

From their heights, we see our fate,
A world vast, a future bright;
In their strength, we trust and hope,
Guided by their timeless light.


- Julius Nyerere
