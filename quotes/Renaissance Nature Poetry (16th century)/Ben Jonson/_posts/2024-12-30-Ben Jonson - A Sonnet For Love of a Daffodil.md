A Sonnet, For Love of a Daffodil

The daffodil! Thou sweet charmer of the fields,
  With golden hue so glinting in Thy grace,
These days of spring, each flower yields
  Is bidden forth with strong embrace.

   Fair queen of morn, I place my trust;
   Thy beauty, pure, doth cause my heart,
As if this dew, a gentle lust,
  Doth spring and never part.


- Ben Jonson
