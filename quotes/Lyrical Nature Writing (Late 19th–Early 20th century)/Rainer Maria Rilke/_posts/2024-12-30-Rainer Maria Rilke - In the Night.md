In the Night

In the night, the longing comes
    and touches the experience.
    I breathe softly in the dark,
    as if speaking to a flower’s dew
    that lies open on a branch.

    Oh love, if you were just as easy as a sleeping flower
    then I could lay beside you and breathe quietly,
    waiting for the dawn to wake you.

—Rainer Maria Rilke
