The Wrapped

Each moment wearies, unfurls,
every soul a hope threaded.
We cast hours like soft nets,
where opportunities flourish,
a hand rising, birds on their way.

Where we all found light chimes,
we truth spin, reflecting layers,
around crisp love—past flowers bloom,
it comes out to greet us,
in stunning splendor, desire lingers,
all lives across become shared.
