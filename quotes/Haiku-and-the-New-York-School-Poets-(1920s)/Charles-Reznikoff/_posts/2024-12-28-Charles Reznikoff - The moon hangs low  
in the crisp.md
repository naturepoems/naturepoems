quote: "The moon hangs low  
in the crisp autumn sky,  
  leaves whisper their last,  
a soft rustle along the ground,  
a reminder that beauty fades  
but lingers on in dreams."

The moon hangs low  
in the crisp autumn sky,  
  leaves whisper their last,  
a soft rustle along the ground,  
a reminder that beauty fades  
but lingers on in dreams.
