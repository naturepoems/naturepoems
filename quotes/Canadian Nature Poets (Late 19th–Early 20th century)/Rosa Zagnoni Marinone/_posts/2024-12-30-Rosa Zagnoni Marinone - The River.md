The River

O river, flowing fast and free,
Thy waters like a hymn arise,
To tell of lands beyond the sea,
To laugh beneath the laughing skies.

Through meadows green and forests deep,
Thou rushest on with ceaseless flow;
While in thy depths, the shadows keep
The secrets of the world below.

- Rosa Zagnoni Marinone
