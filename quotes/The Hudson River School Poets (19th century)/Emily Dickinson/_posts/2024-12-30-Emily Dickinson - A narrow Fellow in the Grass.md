A narrow Fellow in the Grass  
Occasionally rides –  
You may have met Him – did you not  
His notice sudden is –  

The Grass divides as with a Comb,  
A spotted Shaft is seen –  
And then it closes at your Feet  
And opens further on –  

He likes a Whip of Downland –  
But now his lesson fades,  
The eye is mostly on Him –  
Thus ere the lesson's played –  

You may not be too sure who came –  
Or if He came at all –  
The narrow Fellow in the Grass  
Is all the Truth upon –  

"A narrow Fellow in the Grass"

- Emily Dickinson
