Eternal Essence
With every wave that crashes,
Upon the rocky shores,
Nature breathes in cycles,
Of tragedy and triumph,
Echoes of time, eternal.

In the silence of the night,
Stars shimmer with wisdom,
Guiding souls through darkness,
Connected by the universe,
In this sacred existence.

- Spreti Eustachio
