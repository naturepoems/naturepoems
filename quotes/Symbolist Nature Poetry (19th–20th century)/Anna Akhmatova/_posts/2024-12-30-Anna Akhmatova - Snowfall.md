Snowfall

The whisper of the snowflakes fall,
A blanket soft upon the earth,
They hush the world in silken grace,
And bring to rest my heart's new birth.

In white tranquility, I breathe,
In every flake, a thought divine,
As winter wraps me in its arms,
I find my peace, my heart entwined.


- Anna Akhmatova
