The dew is still on the grass,  
When I rise in the morning light;  
When I lift my head, in a sleepy way,  
The stars are gone, but the moon is bright.  

The world outside is a magic place,  
With shadows dancing, and shapes unknown;  
Where every blade of grass is a crystal trace  
Of a night that comes but has flown.

- Ruth Dallas
