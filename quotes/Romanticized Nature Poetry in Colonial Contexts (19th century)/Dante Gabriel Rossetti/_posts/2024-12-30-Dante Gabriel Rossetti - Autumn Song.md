Autumn Song

I
  Like a poet's dream a golden leaf,
     Floating down from the summer grieve.
     Oil a landscape, a great buttress,
     Round the form of an autumn yew.

II
  In regard to moments unchained,
     A honey-sweet vision, again unchained,
     Flitting in the tranquil blue,
     Is the silence of my wish for you.

III
  A transient capture, a sky untamed,
     A chorus of dreams unnamed.
     Like a visage lost in dew,
     Among far sheets of winter's view.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
