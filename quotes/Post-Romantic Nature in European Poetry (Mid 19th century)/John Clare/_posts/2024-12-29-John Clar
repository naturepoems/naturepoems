Upon the hills where shadows play,
And lofty trees blend with the sky;
I find the peace that leads my way,
As nature breathes her gentle sigh.

The birds in flight, the streams that glide,
The blooms that dance in sunny light;
A canvas spun by forces tied,
Reveal a world, enchantment’s height.

For in these realms where silence dwells,
Amidst the colors of the land,
My heart, it beats like boyish bells,
And sings of love's own magic hand.

In every leaf, a story told,
Of love and life and beauty’s grace;
Nature enfolds us, young and old,
In her divine and warm embrace.

- **Nature’s Realm**
