O spirit of the woods,  
Where the light once glimmered,  
In a forest deep and deep where the shadows loom,  
For the grove that never faded, all in bloom;  
The sun shall rise again, where breezes passed  
And o’er the glades dance forth from the fore  
To the brightening of that fateful morn,  
Till the wild-tine fasting from ignoble stores.

- Lord Byron
