Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction

The poem of the mind in the act of finding
What will suffice. It has not always had
To find: it is a finding that has made
Itself for itself. Having a complex story,
A story that is rich and verdant, akin
To the startling colors of the earthâ€”they are
The thoughts that differ from the original,  
Not those of the latent mind, but those
Of the mind appraising and finding, it stands
In this way, on the rocks of the morning.


- Wallace Stevens
