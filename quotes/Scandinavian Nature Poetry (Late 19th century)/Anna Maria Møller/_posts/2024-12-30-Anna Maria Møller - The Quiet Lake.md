The Quiet Lake

Mirror of the sky so wide,
In your depths, the stars abide,
Nestled in the forest's arms,
Where tranquility enfolds and charms.

Ripples dance on serene glass,
As memories of the day do pass,
The call of loons, a lonesome song,
In your embrace, where we belong.

Time stands still as shadows creep,
In twilight’s glow, the night’s sweet sweep,
With nature’s secrets softly spoken,
In your stillness, hearts unbroken.


- Anna Maria Møller
