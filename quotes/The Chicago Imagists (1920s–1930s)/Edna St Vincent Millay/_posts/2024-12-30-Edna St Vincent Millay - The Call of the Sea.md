When I was once at sea,  
And swam in the sun of swim,  
Where hopes kissed the flowers,  
With the long sway of ships,  
Unlatching a fathom of sea,  
And straight to the cliffs,  
                       Tides dropping the years,  
    The sun burnt my heart to white,  
     The sugar-blossoms—  
     A lark breasted mist,  
   And the tremble of waves,  
And tides do flow through me,  
       To hear once more  
With a distant enemy's song,  
  That green of the grass,  
And all that each time I see  
When my heart lifts and blows,  
Together with a bird—  
And rain shapes too bright to time!  
   
   Alone,
.  
And cold as a bone.  



- Edna St Vincent Millay
