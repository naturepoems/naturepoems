The mountains rise like mighty dreams,  
To touch the vast and azure sky,  
They stand in silence, profound themes,  
And teach the heart to soar up high.  

Their rugged faces tell of time,  
Of storms endured, and suns embraced,  
In every crevice, every climb,  
The spirit of the wild is paced.

- William Ellery Channing
