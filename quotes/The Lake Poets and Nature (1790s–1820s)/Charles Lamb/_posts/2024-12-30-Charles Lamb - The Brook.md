The Brook

I wandered by the brook so clear,
As waters danced with joy and cheer,
In every ripple, a secret song,
In Nature's arms, I felt I belong.

The pebbles trace a crystal line,
While willows droop in graceful bend,
There I paused, where hearts entwine,
And in its flow, my spirit mend.

Oh, brook, you carry dreams of old,
In every turn, my heart will find,
A solace rich and stories told,
With laughter, life, forever kind.
