In the Forest
Wooden giants stretch their limbs,
Dressed in green, where silence swims.
Echoes of life in whispers weave,
Nature’s secret, we perceive.

Mossy earth beneath our feet,
A soft embrace, the world’s heartbeat,
In shadows deep, tranquility,
In the forest, we feel free.


- Antonio SantElia
