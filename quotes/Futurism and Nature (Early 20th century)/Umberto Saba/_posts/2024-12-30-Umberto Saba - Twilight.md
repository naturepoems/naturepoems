The sun dips low, a fiery orb,
Painting the horizon in shades of gold,
As shadows stretch and mingle,
With the darkening earth’s tender fold.

Crickets sing their evening song,
A chorus to the night’s arrival,
While the stars blink awake,
In the tapestry of the cosmos, they revel.

This twilight hour, a bridge of peace,
Between the day’s turmoil and night’s embrace,
Reminds me that life ebbs and flows,
In the dance of nature’s endless grace.

- Umberto Saba
