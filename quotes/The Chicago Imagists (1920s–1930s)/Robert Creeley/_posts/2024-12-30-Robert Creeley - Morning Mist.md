Morning Mist

The sun breaks through,
a date rolls on,
  a moment holds its breath,
yet the mist still wraps,
blurring edges,
everything still looks tender,
  close to your skin,
at any moment now,
you anticipate flight,
bubbling laughter,
the hush flows back,
feels of kindness,
  in the twilight of dawn.


- Robert Creeley
