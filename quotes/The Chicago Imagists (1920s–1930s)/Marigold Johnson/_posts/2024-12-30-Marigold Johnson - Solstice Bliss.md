Solstice Bliss

On solstice day, the sunbeams shine,
A blessing wrapped in warmth divine,
The longest light, our hearts rejoice,
In nature’s song, we find our voice.

The warmth enfolds the earth anew,
As every flower lifts its head,
In golden hues, the world breaks through,
And in this light, our spirits led.

- Marigold Johnson
