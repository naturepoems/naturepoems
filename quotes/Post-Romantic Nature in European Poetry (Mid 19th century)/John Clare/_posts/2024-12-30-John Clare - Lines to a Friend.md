Lines to a Friend

Let friendship's golden light be shed,
Upon the world, as the spring does bloom;
In every heart that lingers there
The greenness plays, and death, his doom.

Let every flower a promise bring,
And every leaf in courage stand;
For nature speaks in whispers—sings
And lifts the strength of all who’d stand.

So side by side, look to the sky,
Where stars like blossoms sweetly lie,
And feel the bond of earth and sole—
For beauty found must feed the soul.

- John Clare
