O Nature! there is something in thy face,
That seems to be the emblem of the grace,
Of all the world; and thus mine eye and heart
Are led to fall in love with every part.

The sun that sets, the moon that rises high,
The dew-drops glist’ning, from the grass awry,
The flowers that bloom, the leaves that fall like rain,
In nature’s arms, I find the beauty’s gain.


- William Hazlitt
