Finally

A small bird
flits now and then
  across the small grass
on the edge of the
  river bank.

She thinks of the weight
of the great sky
  and that of smaller trees,
    the lean rocks,
  the pinched stripes of sun
and shade,
    the twist of wild grass.

Is she a small bird too.
Can she leap
  from branch to branch,
        and be free—
  yet feel the weight
    the weight under.

H.D.
