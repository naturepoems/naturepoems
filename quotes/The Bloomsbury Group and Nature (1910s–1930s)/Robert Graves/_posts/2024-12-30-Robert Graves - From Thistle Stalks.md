From thistle stalks and golden blooms,
I taste the essence of life's threads;
From colors popping in the glooms,
To brush the spirit where it treads.
Like velvet hands adorning air,
Compose the heart with a soft sigh,
Amidst the bright and woodlands fair,
I shall be found where the eagles fly.  


- Robert Graves
