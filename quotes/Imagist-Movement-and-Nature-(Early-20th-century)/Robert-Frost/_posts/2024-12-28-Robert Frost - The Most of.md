The Most of It

I was all for the most of it,
The sunny land on the shore,
And nothing ever had promised me,
But less in the noon sun's core.

But I saw a made man still awake,
A tree coming home at night,
And how the big farm there once was
Was just not there from the sight.

And trees all around were trembling live,
I couldnâ€™t let go of the grief.
I put it into what I could save;
I am still holding the leaf.

- Robert Frost
