A single dewdrop gleams,
Reflecting a day of promise,
The sun whispers,
And content flows,
As the earth, moist and rich,
Nurtures its every adornment.
Oh sing, little plants,
And stretch your joy;
Dance in the breeze,
For the colors caress
Infinity in each sway,
Every pulsation sings life,
Repeating the cycle,
Bringing forth tomorrow.

— **Virginia Woolf, Dewdrop's Dance**
