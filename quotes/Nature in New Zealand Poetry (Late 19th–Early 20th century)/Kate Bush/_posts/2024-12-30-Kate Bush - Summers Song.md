The cicadas sing a summer dance,
each note a bright echo of warmth.

Fields alight with the color of wild blooms,
a riot of life bursting in joyous refrain.

In this moment, everything is alive,
a tapestry woven in laughter and light.

Embrace the warmth as daylight wanes,
let the evening drape you in calmness.

- Kate Bush
