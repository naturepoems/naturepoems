Before the Storm -  
The air rests still -  
And Nature, stored in thunder -  
Beholds the impending chill -  

No sound can lift the burden  
Of clouds so heavy hung -  
The anxiousness enfolding  
Of something deep, among -  

All creatures turn in stillness -  
As eyes await the breaking -  
Nature whispers worry -  
Yet all are loved and waking -  

For thus the world remembers -  
A delicate unfolding,  
When Nature breathes in silence -  
A truly, enveloping -  


- Emily Dickinson
