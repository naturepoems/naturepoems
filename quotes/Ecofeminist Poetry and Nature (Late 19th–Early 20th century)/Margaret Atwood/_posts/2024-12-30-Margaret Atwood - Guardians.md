The mountains stand guard,
Their peaks cradled in cloud,
A spirit broken yet raised,
Within each curve: the rhythm
Of the ages, pulse,
Centuries of waving grass,
And stone in conversation—
They weather storms
And echoes unfurl,  
What is spoken in silence,
An original calling, all was once
Soft, the rock, the sky, the sea.  
What is born again is
A symphony of rock and memory.

- Margaret Atwood
