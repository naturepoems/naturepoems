A voice, a chorus of the deep;
 And it is I, as I roam the thick
 Woods with the white-kerchiefed night,
 
 The brook murmuring emeralds, the leaves
 Whispering lilac to the shapes of sleep,
 
 The fireflies flickering like dying stars,
 In the slumber of the night that is made bright
 By silent moonlight, o, how beautiful!


- Derek Walcott
