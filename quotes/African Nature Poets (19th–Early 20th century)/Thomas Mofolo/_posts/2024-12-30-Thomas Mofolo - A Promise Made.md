With each sunset, a promise made,  
Of a new dawn where dreams cascade,  
Through the lens of nature, we find our way,  
In the cycle of life, we dance and play.

The stars guide our paths, the moon our nights,  
As we journey on beneath celestial lights,  
In tune with the earth, both humble and grand,  
Together we rise, hand in hand.

- Thomas Mofolo
