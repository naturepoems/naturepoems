Hush, hush, said the wind,  
Hush, hush, said the rain,  
I hear you, I hear you  
Saying my name.  
The world leaves its spinning,  
There is only this stillness,  
This whispering hush,  
That makes the trees turn,  
That quiets the water,  
Until it is just  
A whisper, a hush,  
A warm, bright breath  
That pulls you near,  
And then away.
