A hidden brook, its waters clear,  
Reflecting dreams, I draw them near.  
Floral scents in the gentle air,  
Nature's canvas, beyond compare.

With every ripple, reflections glow,  
Stories of yore, I yearn to know.  
In the heart of nature, quiet and deep,  
Lies the peace that I wish to keep.

- Sigrid Undset
