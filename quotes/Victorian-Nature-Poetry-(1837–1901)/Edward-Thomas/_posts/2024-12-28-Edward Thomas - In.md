In Memoriam

The long-lost tall trees by the river moan,
For they have rubbed their naked arms,
In friendly gloom—where even the stones,
Are given to smiles of soft alarms.  
They pass their days upon the shore—
Shall I pass days like days before?
For if they speak of lonesome, treason,
Let me blend into a shaded season.

Then dream where no more wanderers drove—
In moments full of leaves and shade,
While shadows cross in evening's grove
And moons drift quiet an hour laid.

— Edward Thomas
