In the mountainous halls of solitude,  
Where the pines stand guard against time,  
I seek solace in the winds that sigh,  
Bearing secrets from the world above,  
In whispers wrapped in twilightâ€™s arms.  
The valleys breathe their ancient tales,  
And I am but a fleeting shade,  
Tracing the delicate stitching of the dusk,  
While fireflies paint the night with hope,  
Illuminating my wandering path,  
To the sweet embrace of quietude.

- Jules Laforgue
