Autumn Song

O wild wind,  
You are my own!  
If you could pile  
Your leave for me,  
Tangle the russet trees  
To light my way  
To all your awakenings.

Bring me the wild lyre,  
Where all the scattered leaves  
Are heartrending chords  
Fingers playing  
On the thin stillness.

Sing my name, O wind,  
Every note  
Whispering through the sifting  
Esplanades of autumn.

â€” D.H. Lawrence

- DH Lawrence
