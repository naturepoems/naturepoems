The Eternal Road
I stand before the boundless sky,
My heart, an open sea of sorrow,
Each star a tear, each cloud a sighâ€”
The silent night still brings a tomorrow.

Beneath the trees, the whispers flow,
On leaves that dance in gentle breeze;
The moonlit path where shadows go
Holds secrets of the ancient trees.

- Ilya Ehrenburg
