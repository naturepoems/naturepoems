There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
There is society where none intrudes,
By the deep sea, and music in its roar:

I love not man the less, but Nature more,
From these our interviews, I can see,
In nature, I find the mirror, calm, forlorn,
And through the heavens, I roam free.

- William Wordsworth
