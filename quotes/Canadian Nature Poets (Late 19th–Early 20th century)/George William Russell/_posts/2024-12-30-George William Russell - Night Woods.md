I wander through the woods at night,
The moon is shining clear;
The silver dew upon the leaves,
Makes all the world seem near.
A whisper in the shadows calls,
The gentle breath of night;
The stars are like the friendly light,
That leads my heart to flight.

Oh, let me linger here awhile,
In peace beneath the trees;
For nature, with her patient smile,
Gives solace to my pleas.
And in the stillness of her arms,
I find my spirit’s balm.


- George William Russell
