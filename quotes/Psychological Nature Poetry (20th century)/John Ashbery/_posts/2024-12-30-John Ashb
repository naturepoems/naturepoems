When the stars awaken,
dancers in the heavens,
silently bowing their heads
to our insignificant world,
a glimmer of hope.

What lies beyond,
a language our hearts grasp,
a symphony that echoes,
trilling through the branches
and cascading into water,
we continuously seek,
we breathe as one,
a fleeting harmony.

We dream of bursting galaxies,
while roots entwine beneath,
a communion of life unheard,
a legacy sprawling,
carving paths of light—
dancing in this existence,
a moment where all becomes,
every flicker an eternity,
a canvas embracing infinity.

Step softly and observe,
not just for ourselves,
but for the spirits of the night,
for all that we’ve touched,
a connection forever woven
in the fabric of dreams.

— "When the stars awaken"
