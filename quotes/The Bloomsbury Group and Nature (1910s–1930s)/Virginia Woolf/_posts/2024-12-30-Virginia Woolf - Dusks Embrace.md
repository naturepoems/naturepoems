Oh, the beauty of dusk!
The whispers of the night,
Entwined within shadows,
And lingering in silence;
The first star arrives,
A love woven in twilight,
Sinking into depths unseen;
While the moon, a guardian,
Hovers above, a patron,
Who cradles the secrets
And all that remains hush’d.

— **Virginia Woolf, Dusk’s Embrace**
