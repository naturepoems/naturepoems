The Forest

Beneath the canopy of leaves so green,  
In filter'd light, an emerald sheen,  
I wander through the ancient woods,  
Where nature breathes and life once stood.

The whispers of the trees alive,  
In timeless rhythms, strive to thrive,  
While dappled paths do weave and wend,  
In quietude, my heart does mend.

Oh, sacred forest, still and deep,  
In your embrace, my secrets keep,  
Each rustling leaf, each gentle sound,  
In nature’s arms, I am unbound.

- Margaret Munro
