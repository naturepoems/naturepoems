Ode to the Mountain!—in thy majesty,  
I stand in awe, where earth and heavens meet;  
Thy peaks rise high, a grand epitome  
Of strength, of beauty, where all skies retreat.  

Each winding path, a journey to behold,  
Each whispering breeze, a tale of boldness told;  
In Nature’s arms, my spirit feels consoled—  
For in this place, my very heart unfold.
