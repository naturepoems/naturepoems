The Blooming Rose
In gardens rich with life and hue,
A single rose unfolds anew,
With petals soft, a fragrant gift,
In every bloom, our spirits lift.

The sun and rain, they work in tune,
To nurture dreams beneath the moon,
In each blossom, a silent prayer,
A testament that love is there.


- Ruth H M Houghton
