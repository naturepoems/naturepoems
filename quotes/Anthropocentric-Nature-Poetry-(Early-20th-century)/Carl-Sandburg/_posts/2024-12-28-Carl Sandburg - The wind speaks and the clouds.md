The wind speaks and the clouds listen,
a retired sailor in the high blue sailing
with all his dreams of home.
There are horizons where great birds fly,
we must watch them ride the gale,
hear their free song rise and fall,
and keep within the heart the knowledge
that life flows like a river,
but ever to reach the sea awaits.
Hold fast to dreams beneath the sun.

- Carl Sandburg
