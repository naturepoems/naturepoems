Dawn
The first light breaks,
softly brushing the world awake.
A whisper of warmth,
a sigh of the night fading,
trees stretch their limbs,
yawning in the glow.
Birds erupt in joyous song,
a chorus of beginnings,
a new day unfolds,
a canvas of possibilities once more,
painting nature anew in golden hues.


- Julian Tuwim
