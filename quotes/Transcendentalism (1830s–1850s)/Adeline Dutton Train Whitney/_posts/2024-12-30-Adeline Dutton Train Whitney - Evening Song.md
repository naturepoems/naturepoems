Evening Song
The day slides slowly into night,
As shadows fall and the stars shine bright;
The breeze is hushed, and the world at rest,
In nature's arms, our hearts are blessed.
The shadows stretch across the land,
Painting stillness with a gentle hand;
The moon looks down with a silver ray,
And blesses the world by night’s soft play.
