A tree stands  
In the light of the sky;  
It thrums and whispers  
In the wind’s breath,  
With fingers of leaves  
Turning the sunshine  
Into drops of gold.  
Every shadow it casts  
Is a memory  
Of the dance of the stars;  
I touch its rough trunk  
To know  
What it is to stand  
In the presence of power.
