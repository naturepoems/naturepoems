The Path of Light
 
Through wooded trails where sunlight lies,  
A path unfolds, alive and free,  
With beams of gold that touch the skies,  
A journey into mystery.  

Each step we take, the world reveals,  
A canvas painted bright and bold,  
In nature’s art, our spirit heals,  
A tale of life in hues untold.

- Edward Burne-Jones
