The Nightingale’s Tune
 
Amidst the night, a sweet refrain,  
The nightingale begins to sing,  
A serenade of joy and pain,  
In harmony with stars in spring.  

With every note, a dream takes flight,  
In twilight’s glow, the world at peace,  
The voice of nature, pure delight,  
Where shadows fade and sorrows cease.

- Edward Burne-Jones
