On First Looking into Chapman's Homer

Much have I travelled in the realms of gold,
   And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
   Round many western islands have I been
   Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
   Often 'tis said that the material may fold
   Until its heart, which the pure human came to claim
Can put the clay, the air - their holds sublime,
In the stillness—hearts unbowed, subdued by shame.
   And in my wandering's entry, food of thought,
   An eager reader, had no way to find;
   Plus shades of ideal beauty must be bought.
By deemed within a land of ample parts-held.
   From those tenacious strands were blest the past,
Twine the vine, and yet divinely planned,
To speak with grave prophetic grace so vast,
With reverence poised and slumber not in hand—  
Holding dear Memoirs of sigh on bead and strand.

Though invested of royal grace to sigh,
   Rapture ere meant to achieve—a glad heart stays.
Through heaven's wild expanse bid breathless fly,
   Upon the air moved me close, with childish gaze—
Sense made soft light of love's splendid embrace.
In dark repose, I find it matchlesse single evening.

For I headlong arrayed endure too long;
Nature—one circle’s crowd bedecked replies,
To make during time's chase be the magic sting,
   'Tis chapman's voice which breath folds and widows may sigh,
A tune spoken for me where pale gazes fill, and voice grow mild.
   And bid pleasure come,
Beneath the moonbeams herself entail.

That all-shaping charm—whose mighty fire can dwell,
Life, pulse, flaming orbs blended on flight descend.

And with hands, burnt picture, treasured within,
Had, though scientific ways, much to win, bid pray command.
   Unseen eternal cause renew springs breath,
Fired by mine, while cradled tune of inspirations call bright laid new.

The keen) voice ever felt—to cry or reveal
At length twilit rest—the heavens reveal
Call my dream—beauty’s touch arrayed.

For in solace gathered, our eyes receive sound.
And, though now shrouded—long deep night"
Which winds with gentle twist away.
And as the great truths imbue each skill of hold laid.
Portions lift—this wood profound yet fairy found.
Whereby kindred light thy hidden flame of vision found, 
As glided slowly by—Nature’s fame, and then bestow.


- John Keats
