The Wilderness

Into the wild my heart takes flight,
Where every moment feels so right,
With every path that winds and weaves,
Nature's canvas softly breathes.

The mountains hold a sacred trust,
The valleys rich with life and dust,
In rivers deep, my spirit’s found,
In wilderness, my soul unbound.

Oh lead me to that distant place,
Where time slows down and finds its grace,
In nature’s arms, my heart will roam,
The wilderness will be my home.

- John Muir
