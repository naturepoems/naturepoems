The River

O how the river winds and flows,  
In laughter, song, and cheer;  
From distant heights to verdant meadows,  
It meanders, crystal clear.  

It reflects the skies above,  
In hues of blue and gold;  
In every droplet, pulse of love,  
A story richly told.  

Let us walk beside its banks  
And listen to its play;  
In every sound, the heart it thanks  
For nature’s grand ballet!

- William Hazlitt
