The Grey Sea

The grey sea and the coast,
  The ships go out to sea,
And the waves sing low to me
  A song of calm and boast.

The pebbles by the shore
  Are dreams that roll in foam,
I fear not the grey sea, for
  It is my happy home.

For the tide that ebbs and flows,
  And breaks upon the land
Is the pulse of nature's heart,
  And life still makes its stand.


- Mary Gilmore
