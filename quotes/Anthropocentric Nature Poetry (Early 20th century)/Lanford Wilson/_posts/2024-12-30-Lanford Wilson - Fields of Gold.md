The fields stretch wide under the sun,  
a golden sea swaying  
to the rhythm of the breeze.  
Here, the farmer toils,  
his hands earth-worn  
with the love of creation,  
a testament to the bond  
between man and land.  
In every seed, a story,  
a legacy of generations,  
where harvest spills forth abundance  
at the end of each season,  
a cycle repeated,  
a prayer in the earth  
dancing with all creation.
