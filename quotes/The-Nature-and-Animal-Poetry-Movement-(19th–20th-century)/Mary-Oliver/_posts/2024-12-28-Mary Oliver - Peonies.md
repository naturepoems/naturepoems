Peonies
O, to be a peony
in the early June sunlight;
to be so bold,
so generous in the open light;
to reach through the soil,
into the bright, stirring air.
I stand alone and yet supported,
by these blooms,
in every corner of the garden,
a tableau of color and form,
a display of life and death.
For in the waiting, we become
something larger—I watch,
my heart as open,
as the peony’s trumpet flower—
a song that will reach the heavens.

- Mary Oliver
