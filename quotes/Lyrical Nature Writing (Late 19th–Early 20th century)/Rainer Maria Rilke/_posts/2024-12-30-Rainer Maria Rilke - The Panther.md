The Panther

His gaze has grown so dim; he cannot hold
    it anymore. It is as if it were
    the world; through the gentle bars of the cage
    it presses, and he cannot let it go.

    The world is not so large; he has been here
    for a long time, but no one can say
    how long.  What thoughts must pass through his head?
    The world slips through his hands like a small wind.

    He’s seen too many things, and though he waits,
    still it closes up against him thickly,
    he cannot see beyond the point of the end.

    And when the evening talks, every time it seems
    like someone quietly brushed his heart.

—Rainer Maria Rilke
