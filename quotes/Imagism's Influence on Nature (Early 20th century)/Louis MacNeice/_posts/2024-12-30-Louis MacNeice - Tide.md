The man who is the most concerned with the tide
Was filled with the salt sea breeze;
His skin was as brown as a wheaten loaf,
His hand was hard with the grip of the sea.

He knew where the fish lay in the sea
He knew where the currants lay in the sun;
He made his harvest beyond the hills;
He was loved, and he was lonely as the moon.


- Louis MacNeice
