The Night
Now the cold night approaches,
And shades are stealing far,
Upon the shores of silence,
I wander from my star,
My thoughts are slow with darkness,
The clouds are thick and still.
Alone upon the border,
In night's vastness, fate I thrill.

A god, where thought grows deeper,
When whispered voices cease;
With muffled heart, in shadows,
I find my shelter, peace.
'Til in my heart a brightness
Comes flowing like a star,
Upon the shores of silence,
Oh, blessèd night! My car!

- Henry Vaughan
