There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
There is society where none intrudes,
By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:
I love not Man the less, but Nature more,
From these are born the haunts of a thirst for more,
For everything that Nature lends and gives,
Is richer than the lives that man enshrines,
Beneath whatever Heaven he most lives.

-- Robert Southey, "On Seeing the Redbreast in a Cage"
