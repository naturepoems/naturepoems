The Thought-Fox

I
I imagine this midnight moment’s forest:
Something else is alive
Beside the clock’s loneliness,
And this blank page where
My fingers move.

II
The only fox that was ever real,
His nose pressed against the dark,
His shadow scenting the stillness,
Attentive to what stirs
In dim light.

III
He stalks the trap of this story,
His wildness held on the edge
Where dreams loom like stars.
The reality pushes against
This mind of a man alone.

IV
I keep the pen dark with fur,
With the unmistakable movement
Of a deeply flushed night,
The thought-fox sliding in me,
Drawing its tales from lighting clouds.

V
A single breath on this paper,
To those unquiet dreams behind this night’s sleep,
His paws awake and astonished,
And my fingers move, knowing.

- Ted Hughes
