A Garden's Breath

In the garden where soft petals lie,
Sweet fragrances drift beneath the sky,
Colors dance in gentle embrace,
Nature’s beauty finds its place.

Bees hum a tune, the sun’s soft kiss,
Moments like these, we cannot miss,
In the rustle of leaves, a secret is told,
Of life, of love, in nature's fold.

- David C Okwuosa
