The fields of gold, where wild grains sway,
Beneath the sun’s enduring ray.
With every breeze, the world unfolds,
A canvas woven, rich and bold.

The farmers’ toil, their lives at stake,
In harmony with land they make;
Each harvest sings of earth's delight,
In labor found, both sweet and bright.

- Elin Wägner
