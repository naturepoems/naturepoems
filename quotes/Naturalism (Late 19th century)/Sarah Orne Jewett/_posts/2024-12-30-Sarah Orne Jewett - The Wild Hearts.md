The wild hearts soar beyond the dreams,
   Untamed by nature’s loom;
   Through heaven’s gate the sunlight beams
   And kiss the valley’s bloom.
   The endless skies shall ever keep
   A promise born of yore,
   As sleep enfolds the world so deep,
   In mysteries of lore.
   And night in stillness brings its shroud,
   While gazing deep below,
   We wander softly through the crowd
   Of stars that shine and glow.

- Sarah Orne Jewett
