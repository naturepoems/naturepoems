The Drunken Boat

As I was floating down impassive Rivers
I discovered lakes and shores I did not know.
I was not even aboard, I was a drunken boat,
It was the rivers that carried me away.

There are a crew of stars, vultures, and tyrants
That deserted my tired hull.
I saw the monster of ice, the tamer bird,
The wood that show kindest face.

And I gazed at the sea, the lake far away
Forever and wearily roaming along the sky.
I wanted to tremble and sail like a mother
To behold the trees and flowers scatter their magic.

The sea rumbled with movement, soaked in glory;
A great roar clanged across the skies!
What do I hear? Far behind, from the horizon,
Fields shadowing the shadows. Woe to life!  

Oh for the immense resound that makes live a dead life,
The unfathomable, cruel waves of the sea,
And within the strife of friends, majestic waters,
Help me, sun, a traveler lost among those things!

- Arthur Rimbaud
