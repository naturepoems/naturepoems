The Wild Common

In this wild common  
Where the hush of the dark  
Can rise from the stream,  
Moss gathers and blooms  
In the skin of the stones.

The wood is moving,  
The shadows flutter,  
I tell you a peep  
Of a world always  
Stripping out a green truth.

Glistening dew on  
The coral fronds,  
Life unwinds itself  
And the moon rolls on,  
Leaving trails of white.

â€” D.H. Lawrence

- DH Lawrence
