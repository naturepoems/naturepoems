In the stillness of summer, the fields are unbound,
Each blade of the grass in repose does reply.
Plum trees bear witness, their blossoms confound,
The fragrance a question—low, deeper, and high.
Will you speak of the harvest 'neath azure-touched skies,
Or dance with the shadows as daylight says bye?

- Edna St Vincent Millay
