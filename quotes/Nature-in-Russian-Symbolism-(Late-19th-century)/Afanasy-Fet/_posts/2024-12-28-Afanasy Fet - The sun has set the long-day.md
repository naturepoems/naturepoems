The sun has set; the long-day fades
Into a mist that wraps the woods;  
The nearness of the great unknown  
Lays gently on these solitudes.  

The twilight twinkles through the leaves,  
The gold-encrusted evening glows,  
And shadows brush the fragrant sheen,  
Where all my lonelier longing goes.

- Afanasy Fet
