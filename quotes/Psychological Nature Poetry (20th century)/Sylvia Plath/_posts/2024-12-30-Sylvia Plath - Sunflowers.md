I see the sunflowers
      Turn their heads,
               Following the light,
A slow balletâ€”
In fields where the winds
   Whistle low.
   They stand 
               Stalwart,
As summer lessons,
         Through time.
I feel their warmth,
         Embraced by light.

Across the horizon,
Flame and gold,
                 A fleeting moment,
And stillness prevails.

- Sylvia Plath
