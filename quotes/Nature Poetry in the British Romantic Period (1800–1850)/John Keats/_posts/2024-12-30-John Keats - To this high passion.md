To this high passion and bright joy,
The threaded hills like spun pearl/thread,
The streams of silver glisten through,
And the night trails fragrant across thy cheek,

O creature of my dreams, behold
The solemnity of a flower's desire,
And the emerald’s sultry flesh does yield,
A beauty unseen—the art of loam.

So pure, dear heart, so pure and bright,
With a heart in thy bloom—the love they give,
To flower the day, and brighten the night,
And feel beyond a spirit adrift.
— To this high passion

- John Keats
