Beneath the vast and starry dome,
The earth spins softly, our shared home.
Life pulses in every verdant blade,
In the simple moments, joy is made.

The whispering trees tell tales of old,
In their ancient arms, wisdom unfolds.
Nature sings in a thousand notes,
In its melody, our spirit floats.

- Mariano Fortuny
