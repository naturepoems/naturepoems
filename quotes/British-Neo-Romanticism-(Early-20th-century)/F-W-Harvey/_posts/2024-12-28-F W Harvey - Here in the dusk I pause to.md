Here in the dusk, I pause to think,
Where golden roses bloom and sway,
The scent of life, the twilight drink,
In natureâ€™s arms, I long to stay.

As stars begin their twinkling dance,
I sense the heartbeat of the night,
In every shadow, every glance,
The beauty turns the dark to light.


- F W Harvey
