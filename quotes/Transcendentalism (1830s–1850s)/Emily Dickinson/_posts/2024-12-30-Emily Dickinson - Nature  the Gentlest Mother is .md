Nature – the Gentlest Mother is –  
Impatience hath her Play –  
Yet hath she pebbles for reply  
And shade – for Everday –  

And meekly to the Story –  
She adds her gentle Chime –  
The Leaves – lead in the Chorus –  
To every Grass – a Rhyme –  

Their Murmuring in Unison –  
With me – the only Way –  
As Shrubs – grow in the Heather –  
By necessary Law –

- Emily Dickinson
