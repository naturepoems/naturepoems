The ocean dances ‘neath the moon,  
a melody on endless sway;  
as tides embrace, then are gone too soon,  
whispering secrets of the day.
\nSeashells whisper tales of yore,  
a symphony of nature’s art;  
on sandy shores where dreams explore,  
the ocean’s truth will touch your heart.

- John Dewey
