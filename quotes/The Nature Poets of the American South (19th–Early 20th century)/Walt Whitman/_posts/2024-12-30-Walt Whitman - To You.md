To me, the node of the embattled water—  
To me, the lone vessel of a hundred curious observations,  
To me, the whole current and force of humans,  
I see the waters of an unnoticed river,  
And know that you, O life, are flesh of my flesh,  
O sea, O river, O unpeopled stream,  
I know thee, and I feel thy power in my own flesh.

- Walt Whitman
