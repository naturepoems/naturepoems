The Flowers
  
With colors brewed from sunlit skies,
And fragrance stirred by autumn’s sighs,
The flowers bloom beneath the day,
And fashion dreams that drift away.

Through verdant glades their petals play,
In fluffy soft, wild splendor sway,
For in their smiles, a culture sings,
Of beauty—blessings nature brings.

- James Russell Lowell
