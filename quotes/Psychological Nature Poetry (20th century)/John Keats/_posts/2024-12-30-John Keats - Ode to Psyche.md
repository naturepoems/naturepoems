Ode to Psyche

O goddess! hear these tuneful vows to thee,
And find me in the drowsy dusk, you will praise
For a shrine you have given the soul to me,
In my dreams is our heart as we dance with grace,
Dwell in the shadow of a linden tree,
The softest whispers wrapped in a pinch of lace.

       John Keats
