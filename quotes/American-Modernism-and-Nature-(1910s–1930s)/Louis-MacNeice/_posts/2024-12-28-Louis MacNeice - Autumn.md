Autumn Song
  
  The leaves are fading, falling down,  
  Turning to russet, brown, and gold,  
  Each whisper of the breeze comes round,  
  A tale of summer, softly told.

  The sky retreats, a muted blue,  
  The days grow short, the shadows long,  
  A quiet end, a soft adieu,  
  The heart finds rest in autumn's song.

- Louis MacNeice
