The winter so dreary,
   Cloaked in silence and white,
Hushes all of the world
   In the stillness of night.

With the trees heavy-laden,
   And the snowflakes a-fall,
Thereâ€™s a peace in the darkness
   That envelops it all.

Let me wander the pathways,
   In the blanket of soft,
For the heart finds its solace
   In the chill that is oft.

- James Fenimore Cooper
