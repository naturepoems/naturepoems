I would not have thee, dear fellow, be meant
To speak what thou dost not." Atrop, said he,
Well, a few times, sometimes I notice it,
In colors bright mean prizes there to see.
But what is blooms to me unmighty rush
From stranger than Thy womb in the great expanse.
Yet melancholy dreams fulfilled me much
When every shallow trait and wishing at once.


- William Shakespeare
