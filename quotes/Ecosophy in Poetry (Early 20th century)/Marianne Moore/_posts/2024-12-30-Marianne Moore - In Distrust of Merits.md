In Distrust of Merits

Once we have strides 
in a wide river;
roots hang low,
time bridges us over,
we share in murmurs,
yet inadventure,
your sorrow unveils
higher forth to excite inundation.

Thereupon—edges strum,
though wide wake streams.
We grow knotted, my wish; 
yet constricting—
you must admit 
home; even tempests drape 
puppet trees.
Hollow watery dreams!
Doubt hoists our growth,
our knots tighten.

Be gone— 
shellals, to a dim eclipse,
your traveling air soughs
with brims, the fish embrace, 
from pock builds to gentle exhalations—
wise homes of diamonds, scale into flesh.
Intangibles rise in air, refract—
alive in puzzling valleys.

Now each curve your gentle caress,
dances the moist upstairs,
winding around bumps,
from here on sights down,
our sweep embraces;
this petitioning aid draws hours,
whatsheer we line, thus
in weary mistrust 
feeling through storms.
Be strong!

- Marianne Moore
