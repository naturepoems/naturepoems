With the earth under my feet,
Where birds drift in the yellow sky,
They do not touch me—it is soft
I love this moment; this hour is mine,
Like this half-shadowed blue grass,
Woven like a soul over the heavens.
-- I stand clear in the brightness, 
Holding summer’s golden braids, 
And singing my trust to ever-echoing heights.
