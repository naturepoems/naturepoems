To see a World in a Grain of Sand  
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,  
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand  
And Eternity in an hour.

A Robin Redbreast in a cage  
Puts all Heaven in a Rage.  
A dove house fill'd with Doves and Pigeons  
Shudders Hell thro' all its regions.  

A there are two most sacred things  
Thou art the Mother of the Springs;  
Though thy pity teems  
With all vain hopes and dreams,

If Must be asked, who shall remain  
Thus naked on this Holy Plane?  
But in thy heart, as in true ocean       
There the shells abound in motion.  

Thou art the Child of the Sun, the Moon,  
To prove the Earth, which is thy womb:  
So soft the flowers burst into bloom  
And the growing Heaven doth resume.  
      
Distance of heaven upon earth  
That has made its worth known;  
Each Grief, each pain that chastened  
To bring its secrets gladly borne.  

We will lead every flower to blow  
And awaken it in its glow;  
To bridge the soul’s reverence  
Of our wayfarer's innocence.  

Thus life moves with approach and retreat  
And unfold the joy to be complete!  
In the harmony sweet,  
The harmony sweet!

- William Blake
