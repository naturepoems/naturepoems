A RAINDROP

I.
A raindrop fell from the sky at dawn,
Like the sighing breath of a wandering song,
It dances through air, in glees drawn,
A fleeting life where it belongs.

II.
To meet the face of the ancient soil,
It clings to petals, so soft and bright,
A gentle balm for the fierce toil,
Whispers of warmth in the crisp night.

III.
For life's a cycle, each drop a thread,
Weaving through the fabric of all that's green,
And now where the blossoms bloom, it’s fed,
A drop of love yet so unseen.

IV.
So journey on, dear raindrop bold,
For in each tumble you sing your song,
In nature's chorus, you fit the mold,
A sonnet played, all the while you throng!

- John Gibson Lockhart
