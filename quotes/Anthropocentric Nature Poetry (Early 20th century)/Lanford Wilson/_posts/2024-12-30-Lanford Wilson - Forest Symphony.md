In the heart of the forest,  
a symphony hums,  
the rustling leaves creating  
music only the trees understand.  
Moss carpets the ground,  
a soft embrace underfoot,  
where critters scurry,  
a choreography of survival  
in this haven of life.  
The bark speaks of time,  
while the sun filters down,  
a mosaic of shadows and light,  
a dance that reconnects  
with the pulse of the wild,  
a circle of life that breathes  
through the emerald arms of the world.
