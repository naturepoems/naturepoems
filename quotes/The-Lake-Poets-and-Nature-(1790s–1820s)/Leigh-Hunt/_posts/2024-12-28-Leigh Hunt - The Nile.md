The Nile  
'Tis the fairest stream beneath the sun  
That ever bore a crown.  
'Tis the fairest vale that ever teemed  
With joy and peace in one.  
O, Egypt! show thy shores—they're bright--  
All heaven and earth in sight  
With palm trees waving, and a sea  
Of joy and gladsomeness so free!

- Leigh Hunt
