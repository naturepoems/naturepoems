The Wildflower

Amidst the brambles, shy and sweet,
A wildflower blooms, the heart’s delight;
With colors bold, and petals neat,
It dances in the morning light.

No garden care, no master’s plan,
Yet here it thrives, a humble grace;
A lesson taught by Nature’s hand,
A story told in every place.

Let not the fleeting moments fade,
For in the wild, a truth we find;
The life that’s free, the heart unmade,
In nature’s arms, our souls unwind.

- Helen M B M Maud
