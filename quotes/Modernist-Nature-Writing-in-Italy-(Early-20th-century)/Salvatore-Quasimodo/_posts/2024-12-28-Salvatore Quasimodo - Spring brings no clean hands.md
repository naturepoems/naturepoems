Spring brings no clean hands;  
A gift from the fog,
At the foot of the city  
I picked a flower  
That seemed to sigh with your breath.

When the raindrops  
Leaf-melt into the asphalt,
Spring brings no clean hands,
The grove by the house is a chest of treasures  
Dipped in sweet milk.

- Salvatore Quasimodo
