The Skylark

Thou winged soul of purity,  
Thy notes flung forth, like lashes free,  
Leap high into the radiant air,  
Where blooms the fragrance everywhere.  

From bosoms on the branches bright,  
That glows in lustrous summer light;  
Sustained in heights of heaven’s dream,  
Enraptured by a perfect hymn.  

Oh, in the rising winds so clear,  
Thou art the joy of life and cheer!  
Thy love prompts every heart to live,  
In flights of nature, joy to give.
