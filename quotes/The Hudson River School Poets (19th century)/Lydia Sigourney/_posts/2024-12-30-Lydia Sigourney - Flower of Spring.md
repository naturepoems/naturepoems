Flower of Spring

O lovely flower, in spring’s embrace,  
You blossom pure, with gentle grace;  
Your petals soft, a tender sight,  
In sunshine’s glow, your colors bright.

From patterned earth, you rise anew,  
With fragrant whispers, sweet and true;  
In every garden, every grove,  
You tell us of the heart’s true love.

- Lydia Sigourney
