The winds are still, the lake is fair,
And silver'd is the broadening air;
And thou art mine, O happy dream,
That I should wander with thee there.

Together we shall sweep the shore,
And let the wave their love implore;
The glories of the dawn is here,
The wood and stream in echo bore.

- William Wordsworth
