The Grasshopper
   At the hour of forgetfulness,
   she wore not a mask, but a song
   of legs, wings—like music,
   a compromise with time,
   a soul that measured vast space;
   in the low cloud-sweep, bends
   in asymmetric ballet
   while careless wishes dance,
   she flits, with a leap—
   a thin note, a green pulse,
   grace in her silent arithmetic.

- Marianne Moore
