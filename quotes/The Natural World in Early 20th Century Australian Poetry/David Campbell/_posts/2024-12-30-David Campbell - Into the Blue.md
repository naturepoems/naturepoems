Into the Blue

Across the fields, where the sun darts low,
  I hear the alabaster trees;
They bend their limbs, where the shadows grow,
  And touch the grass with the breezes.

I hold the light as it drapes the edge,
  The soft warmth glows in the shade,
While the branches cling like a faithful pledge,
  Where the dawn begins and parades.

The rivers call with a wild, bright tongue,
  The waters ripple low in the lane;
As the valley sings with a shape well sung,
  In a heart which remembers each grain.

To the endless sea, where the whitecaps play,
  The tides come soft on the shore;
In the crisp blue air as the echoes sway,
  I cling to the earth evermore!

- David Campbell
