A butterfly,
Rests on a leaf,
In a quiet nook,
Of the garden.

Not to be startled,
With sudden motion,
Or loud voice —
Lest its delicate flight
Be lost forever,
In the wandering winds.

So let it quietly cling,
As if waiting for a wish,
Blossoming in hushed whispers,
Under the sun’s patient gaze.

— Amy Lowell
