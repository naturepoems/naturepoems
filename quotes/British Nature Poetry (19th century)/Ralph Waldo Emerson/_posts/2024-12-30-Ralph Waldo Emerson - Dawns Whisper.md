Upon the hills, a soft mist lays,
As dawn reveals the woven rays;
The valleys breathe, the rivers sigh,
In natureâ€™s arms, we live and die.

The trees in silence watch us wander,
Their wisdom calls us to ponder;
In every shadow, in every light,
A sacred space, forever bright.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
