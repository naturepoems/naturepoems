A shady nook in a sunny place,
Where the leaping brook doth play,
And the breeze doth kiss with a loving grace
The petals that rise in spray.

O here is a world of perfect peace,
Where the tumult of life is barred;
In the dance of the leaves, my soul will cease,
For here is my spirit's guard.

- George Edmund Street
