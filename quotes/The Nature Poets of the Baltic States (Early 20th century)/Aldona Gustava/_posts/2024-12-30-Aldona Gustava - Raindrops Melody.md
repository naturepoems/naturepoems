Raindrop's Melody
Falling softly from the sky,
Raindrops paint the earth anew,
Each pitter-patter, sweet reply,
In natureâ€™s choir, we are imbued.

They sing of life, of growth, of pain,
Of storms that pass and skies that clear,
In every drop, a sweet refrain,
A dance of love, we hold so dear.

- Aldona Gustava
