The Dunes

The sandy dunes end on the sea;  
they turn with the shadows cast.  
And as I sail through the crests,  
watch how the tides give way to fate.  

Those whispers stretch infinite,  
while grains of life shift  
delighting alongside.  

But it is here I find my heart  
wander through winds  
as laughter melds with foam;  
a moment cherished most  
figures among the rest,  
yet whoever wanders far  
helps seal a love discovered.  

Within this cherished realm,  
how fair these ocean-gold hymns!  
Let me rest in timeless tides.

- Gabriela Mistral
