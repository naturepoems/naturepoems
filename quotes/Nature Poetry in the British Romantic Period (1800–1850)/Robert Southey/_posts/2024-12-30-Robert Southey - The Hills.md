The Hills are like the heart of men,
They swell in vast, enveloping hill.
In their embrace I feel again
A tender love, a breathing thrill,
That Nature gives, so strong and sweet,
That even time can scarce retreat,
When verdant gifts, and flower-drawn air,
Bring gentler dreams, a quiet stare.

-- Robert Southey, "The Hills"
