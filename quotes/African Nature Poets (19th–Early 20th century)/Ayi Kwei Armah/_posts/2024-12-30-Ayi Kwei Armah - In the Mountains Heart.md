Among the mountains high, 
    where silence breathes, 
    and the air is crisp, 
    life takes on a different beat.  

Here rivers carve paths, 
    through granite and stone, 
    a testament to time, 
    relentless in its pursuit, 
    shaping the landscape, 
    etching stories of endurance.  

In the heart of the peaks,
    we find clarity,
    as nature reveals herself, 
    majestic and mysterious, 
    inviting us to listen, 
    to wander, 
    to be one with the mountains.
