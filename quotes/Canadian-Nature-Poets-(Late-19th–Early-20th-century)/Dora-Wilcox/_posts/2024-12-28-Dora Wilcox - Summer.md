Summer Rain
  
  The summer rain descends like sighs,
  Refreshing earth with gentle grace;
  From weary clouds, it sweetly tries,
  To kiss the skin, to hold embrace.
  
  In puddled streets, the children play,
  While nature’s senses come alive;
  The fragrance wafts in soft array,
  As every leaf begins to thrive.
  
  The world is washed, anew it gleams,
  Each droplet glistens in the light;
  A symphony of nature’s dreams,
  Unfolding in the soft twilight.
