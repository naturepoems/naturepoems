Stars in the Night
ï¿½Under the velvet sky so grand,
The stars like diamonds brightly twink,
Each one twinkling in cosmic hand,
While shadows of night begin to sink.
They whisper dreams of distant worlds,
Infinite tales, floating high,
In each glimmer, a wish unfurled,
Bright beacons that never die.



- Julian Grenfell
