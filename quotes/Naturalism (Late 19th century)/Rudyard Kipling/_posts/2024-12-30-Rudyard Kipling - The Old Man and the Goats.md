The Old Man and the Goats

There lived an old man in the vale,
With gentle goats both meek and frail,
He fed them sweet brown grass to please —
Boys and girls would gather near the trees.

With light in his eyes, he watched their play,
For every moment was bright and gay,
But Nature’s breath became a call —
And he knew in time, they would fain turn to fall.

So he lingered close, through the morn and night,
With a watchful gaze, to keep them in sight.
And when they frolicked just out of reach —
He would hie to the woods in a lesson to teach!

- Rudyard Kipling
