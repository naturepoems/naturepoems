The River Merchant’s Wife: A Letter
While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
I had no need for the sun;
I was just a girl wondering what the new day brings.
In the dark of twilight, feels like
I am the river’s bride, singing beneath the moon.

I don't want to be a mere refrain,
I want to walk by the waters, dream,
Finding the gold glimmers of your love in green banks.
I’ve counted each grain of sand,
The waves whispering your name to the shore.

- Ezra Pound
