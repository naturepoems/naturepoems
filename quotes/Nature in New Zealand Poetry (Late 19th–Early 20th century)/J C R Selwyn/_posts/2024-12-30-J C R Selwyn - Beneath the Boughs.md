Beneath the Boughs
Beneath the boughs of ancient trees,
I sought a solace, soft and sweet,
Where sunbeams danced on emerald leaves,
And life’s embrace made me complete.

The laughter of the brook nearby,
Was music only taught by grace,
While birds sang softly to the sky,
In every note, I found my place.

Oh! to linger, wrapped in dreams,
Where Nature holds her sacred sway,
The world a fabric, woven seams,
In silent prayer, I wished to stay.

So let me lie where shadows play,
Underneath the leafy dome,
For in this quiet, hush of day,
I found a glimpse of heaven’s home.

- J C R Selwyn
