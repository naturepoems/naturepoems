From the mountain’s peak, the world unfolds, 
With valleys deep, and stories old.
In every whisper, a tale retold, 
Of love and loss, of magic bold.

The clouds drift by, a painter’s hand, 
In shades of blue, across the land.
Nature speaks in a language grand, 
For those who see, who understand.

So let me wander, let my spirit soar, 
In fields of wonder forevermore.
With nature’s beauty at my core, 
In her embrace, I will explore.

- Andrei Bely
