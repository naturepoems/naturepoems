A Walk at Twilight

As evening wraps the world in hue,
Where shades of violet and blue entwine,
I stroll where whispers of the dew,
Great Nature’s thoughts most gently shine.

Along the paths that dusk creates,
The rustling leaves, the softly sighing,
The stars begin their careful fates,
While twilight bids the day good-bying.

So let me wander, lost in grace,
Among the flowers that dimly fade,
For in the twilight, I find my place,
In Nature's arms unafraid.
