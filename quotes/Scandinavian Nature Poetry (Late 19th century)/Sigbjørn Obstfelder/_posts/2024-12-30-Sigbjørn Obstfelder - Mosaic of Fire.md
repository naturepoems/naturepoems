Autumn leaves fall, a mosaic of fire,
In vibrant cascades, they dance on the ground;
Each crunch beneath foot a reminder of change,
In this fleeting moment, all love is profound.

The air turns crisp, a herald of frost,
And the world dons a cloak, of gold and brown;
In the heart of this season, I gather my thoughts,
With nature reminding me, in beauty, I drown.

- Sigbjørn Obstfelder
