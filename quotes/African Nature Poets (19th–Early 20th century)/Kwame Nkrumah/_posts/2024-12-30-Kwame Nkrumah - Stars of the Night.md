Stars of the Night
Gaze at the heavens, the stars glowing bright,
Each one a promise, a beacon of light.
In the quiet of night, their whispers unfold,
Tales of the cosmos, of mysteries told.

They twinkle in patterns, a celestial map,
Navigating dreams in the soft twilight lap.
For in every glimmer, there's hope and delight,
A reminder of wonder, in the deep of the night.

- Kwame Nkrumah
