The Twilight

In twilight's soft embrace, I linger,
As colors blur into twilight's grace—
And if the stars should whisper truth,
I would entangle myself in their infinite gaze,
For here underneath the expanse of night,
The world lies still, wrapped in secrets,
Where nature's song unfolds its ancient tale,
A warm caress against the cool earth.
