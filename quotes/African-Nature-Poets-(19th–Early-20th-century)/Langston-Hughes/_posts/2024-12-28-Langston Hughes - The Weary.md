The Weary Blues

Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
I heard a Negro play.

Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
By the pale yellow moonlight
He played that sad raggy tune
Like a - like a -
Weary blues.

I heard the Negro sing,
That beautiful song of sorrow.
And the world revolving in its blue.

O blues, blues, my heart is blue.
And the Negro sang that song for me,
Under stars bright against the cold moonlight.

- Langston Hughes
