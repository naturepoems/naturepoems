O World, as God has made it! All is beauty: 
And knowing this, is love, and love is duty. 
What more can I say? 
 

Take the pleasure of the world, and it is but a shadow; 
 This was meant to be, for the good of time; 
What beauty in the call of the lark,  
 When we find ourselves together in our prime.

- Robert Browning
