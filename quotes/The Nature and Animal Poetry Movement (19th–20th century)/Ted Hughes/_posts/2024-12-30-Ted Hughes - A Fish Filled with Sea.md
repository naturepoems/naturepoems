A Fish Filled with Sea

I crumble into a weighless drift,
A wish lost against your currents,
Naturally blending forms and sounds,
So brief, so transparent,
I fill with the slow outstretching ocean,
An embrace of waves—all heights
Leaping, trembling under a burn of sun,
Each ripple a reflection of sea-spurred
Yonder worlds above, indefinite.
Shaping this shimmering shell, this fish,
Holding tight as an echo counts,
Proof of my fears.
I rise like laughter
And weave a net worth creating,
The consciousness washing through ancient paths, 
A drive driving deeper. 


- Ted Hughes
