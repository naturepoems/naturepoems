Nature’s Voice

Through the woods I wander,
As the brook babbles gently,
Carrying secrets of the stones,
The voice of the earth sings,  
And it harmonizes with my heart.

The fragrance of pine lingers,
The wind calls my name,  
Urging me deeper into beauty  
Where the dance of earth’s rhythms  
Twirls into the quiet of my spirit.


- Robert Bly
