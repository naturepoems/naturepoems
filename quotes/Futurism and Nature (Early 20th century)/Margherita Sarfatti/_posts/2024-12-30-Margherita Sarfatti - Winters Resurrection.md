In the heart of winter,
when the world lies still,
a breath of frost dances, –
a silence of white,
underneath, the earth trembles,
ama siren call to the sun,
as dreams dissolve to thaw,
a promise of coming life,
awaiting the tender touch of spring,
a revival written in the earth’s veins.

- Margherita Sarfatti
