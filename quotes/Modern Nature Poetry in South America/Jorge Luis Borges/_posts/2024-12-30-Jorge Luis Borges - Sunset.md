Sunset

The sun dips low,
Painting the horizon in hues,
A canvas of fire and shadow,
Singing a lullaby for the day.

Every moment of twilight
Wraps itself in a gentle embrace,
As colors bleed into silence,
And the world exhales in wonder.

Beneath this fading light,
I find solace in the transience,
Understanding that beauty
Is best when ephemeral.


- Jorge Luis Borges
