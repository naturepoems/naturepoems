On an emerald hill of peace,
The daisies spread in sweetest cheer,
Each petal whispers soft release,
And carries love to all who near.

The clouds drift slowly, shadows play,
On sunlit grass where children chase,
A world that gleams as bright as day,
In nature's arms, there’s warm embrace.

So let us breathe the fragrant air,
And watch the butterflies that soar,
In every heartbeat, find the care,
Of nature’s peaceful, vast decor.

- Emily Brontë
