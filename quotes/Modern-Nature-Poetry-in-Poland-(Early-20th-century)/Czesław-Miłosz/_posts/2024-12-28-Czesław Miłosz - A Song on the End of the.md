A Song on the End of the World

On the last day of the world
I would want to be in a garden,
where everything is in bloom,
where the birds are singing,
where the sun is warm and bright,
where two lovers hold hands,
where the world as it is,
with its sorrows and battles,
is left outside the gates.

I want to see the blue sky,
to breathe the air of paradise,
to feel that everything will remain,
ever so beautiful.

And so it will be.

- Czesław Miłosz
