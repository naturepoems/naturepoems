In the quiet woods where the trees whisper low,  

And the stream dances softly over the stones,  

I seek the embrace of the shadows that grow,  

And the gentle caress of the breezeâ€™s soft tones.


Here, I find solace, in nature's great care,  

Where the heart finds its peace; untouched, unconfined,  

Amongs the tall ferns, sweet wildflowers rare,  

A communion with earth that is tenderly kind.

- Alice Dunbar-Nelson
