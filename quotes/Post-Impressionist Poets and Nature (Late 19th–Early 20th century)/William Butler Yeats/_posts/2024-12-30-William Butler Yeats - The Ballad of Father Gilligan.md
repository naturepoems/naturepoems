The Ballad of Father Gilligan

The man that is now a-poet
Sought at my door if I might,
Through a dream, be given the secret
Of that beauty turned to night.

And to time and time again,
That I should find a way to see
The wonders of the glade again,
Where all my hope and yearning be.

But for love's sake now at last,
I sleep among the willow trees,
And morning light, that comes at last,
Brings colors soft to my mind’s eyes.

- William Butler Yeats
