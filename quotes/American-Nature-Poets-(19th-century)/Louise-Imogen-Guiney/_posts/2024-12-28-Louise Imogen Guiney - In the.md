In the Woods
In the silent woods, I roam,
Among the trees, I find my home.
With every path, a tale to weave,
Of life and love, of hope and leave.
The whispers of the leaves call me,
To dance with nature, wild and free,
Where shadows play and sunlight spills,
In tranquil realms, my spirit fills.

- Louise Imogen Guiney
