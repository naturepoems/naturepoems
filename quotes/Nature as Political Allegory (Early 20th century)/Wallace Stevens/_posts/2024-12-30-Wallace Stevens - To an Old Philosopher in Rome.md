To an Old Philosopher in Rome

The brown bird in the bush
Sings like an old philosopher,
With a big old beard.
He talks of light
And a green sapling beneath
A bloom of yellow sun.
We see his thoughts
In the twinkling of the leaves,
And in between the shadows.  

Is he not wise?
Advise me, he says
With his beak like a stylus,
Advice of bright pollen
And quite lovely shoes.


- Wallace Stevens
