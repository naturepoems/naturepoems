Sunset Reflections

As day does fold in burnt sienna,  
The sky becomes a grand arena.  
Colors clash and softly merge,  
In twilight's glow, our hearts will surge.
  
Each star ignites in velvet night,  
The world below, a dream in flight.  
Nature’s canvas, bold and free,  
A masterpiece for all to see.


- Halfred Lee
