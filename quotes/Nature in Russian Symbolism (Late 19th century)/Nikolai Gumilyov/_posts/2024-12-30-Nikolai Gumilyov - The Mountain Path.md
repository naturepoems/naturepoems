The Mountain Path

Up the mountain, the path winds steep,
Amidst the stones and rugged grace,
Where silence reigns, and echoes leap,
In the embrace of a sacred place.

With every step, I breathe the air,
The scent of pine, the whispering breeze,
Nature's hymn like a velvet prayer,
As I wander through ancient trees.

The crest, it calls, a beacon bright,
Where clouds may kiss the rugged peaks,
And in the sun’s warm, golden light,
The souls of ages stir and speak.

Oh mountain path, my heart's delight,
Through trials faced, you lead me high,
In nature's arms, all fears take flight,
As beauty soars, the spirit flies.

– Nikolai Gumilyov
