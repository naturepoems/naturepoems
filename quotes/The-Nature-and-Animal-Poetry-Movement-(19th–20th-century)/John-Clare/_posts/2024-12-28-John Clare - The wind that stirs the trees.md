The wind that stirs the trees aloft
Low whispers secrets, tales soft;
Of hollows where the wild things creep,
And valleys where the shadows sleep.

The thrushes serenade the long, light days,
In songs that weave through the sun’s warm rays.
By brooks, through thickets, life will thrive,
An ethereal pulse, a dance alive.

In every leaf, a tale unfolds,
In every stone, a memory holds.
My heart beats in rhythm with nature's song,
In her embrace, I forever belong.
— John Clare
