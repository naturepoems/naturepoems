Ode to the Nightingale

My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
  My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
  One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
  But being too happy in thine happiness—
      That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees
In some melodious plot
  Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,
      Singest of summer in full-throated ease.



    

To My Book

Though I be but a book,
  One leaf a meadow be,
I’ll take my place in the vale,
  With horses, trees and the wind's decree,
And all things wild and free.

- Ben Jonson
