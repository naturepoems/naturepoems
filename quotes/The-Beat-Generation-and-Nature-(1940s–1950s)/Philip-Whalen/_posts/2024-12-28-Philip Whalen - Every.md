Every morning,
when the sun rises,
   I see the vast blue,
   and my heart is so
   full of longing that
   I can only stand
   in silence and wonder.
The grassy hills stretch
   far into space,
   whispering secrets
   to the wheat-colored
   grasses and the corn.
At night,
   the stars blink back,
   winking sidewise in the sky—
   I watch in silence.


- Philip Whalen
