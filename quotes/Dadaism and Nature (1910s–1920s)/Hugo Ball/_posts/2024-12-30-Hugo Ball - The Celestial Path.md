The Celestial Path
Traversing the jagged maps,
Where the earth meets heaven,
Where the sun kisses the soil
And the moon dances on water,
Lives a path drenched in dreams.

Hued like the painted sky,
With stardust trailing behind,
The footprints fade with whispers,
Leaving caverns of wonder,
As the universe sings,
In chorus with the gentle night.

- Hugo Ball
