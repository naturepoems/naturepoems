Spring Awakening
The earth awakens from her sleep,
With blooms so bold and secrets deep,
A symphony of colors bright,
In spring’s embrace, pure delight.

The robin's song, the butterfly’s flight,
Each creature feels the daylight’s light,
In every petal, a promise new,
Of life reborn in morning dew.


- Ruth H M Houghton
