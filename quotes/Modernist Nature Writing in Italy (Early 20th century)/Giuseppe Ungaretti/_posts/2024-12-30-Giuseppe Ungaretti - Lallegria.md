L’allegria

         I rejoice 
         At the sun's rim;
         I hold my breath,  
         Like leaves that remember
         The rain;  
         And the grass  
         Shimmers and weeps
         Like an old man
         Released from sorrow.  
         
         
         
         


- Giuseppe Ungaretti
