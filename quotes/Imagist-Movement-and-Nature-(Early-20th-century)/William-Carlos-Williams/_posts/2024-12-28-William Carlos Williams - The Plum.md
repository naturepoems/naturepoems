The Plum Trees
In the little house
at the end of the street,

there are six plum trees,

but I do not see the street,

and the noise of a child is
always behind.

But in the blossoms that fall,

these small clear things begin to bloom,

and birds fly out of the dark,

and an emptiness beside
me begins a new existence.

- William Carlos Williams
