When Death Comes

When death comes  
     like the hungry bear in autumn;  
     when death comes  
     like the measle-powdered deer  
     sliding in with ice and spring,  
     I want to step through the door full of grace,  
     like a dancer in the wild trees,  
     like a mountain of silence,  
     like the ocean's voice singing.  
     And when the final kiss comes,  
     when I cannot hold back,  
     I will have already held  
     life like a precious secret,  
     and the darkness will find no reproach  
     in my smile.  
     I was brave and loved every moment.

- Mary Oliver
