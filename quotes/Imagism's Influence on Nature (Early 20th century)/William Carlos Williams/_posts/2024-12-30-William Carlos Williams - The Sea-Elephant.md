The Sea-Elephant
That large old man holds out
this mirror

so we can see
our slim purpose

there in the gray sky.
A yellow airplane

carries our sister
Downward, I go in

and that light
holds on tight. 

No high lark refrains here
but mistletoe

beneath the secret hills
as our lovers

keep each other safe as they close.

To fly!
The wide, beautiful land

I see now,
all that green!
Draw the light back

and thunder!
All this year,
madness compresses

and the wind
will tug at your heart,

finding the outhouse gray as it
lets go.

Wherever I move, I am whole—
how intensely

will crack those sounds
between alive and ashamed.

Upon a blade of water,
spread well—
how the heart,

like a featherbed—
at home!! 

To yield,
light chokes back,
invokes and laughs,
collects abscissa,

turning toward what I thought brings enough.

This time is fine.
Consider it mine.
Good neighbour!

And I see sea-turtle,
Our response!

I, calmly floating (surely!)
be turned---

Oh—, I yearn—
I see!!!  . . .

- William Carlos Williams
