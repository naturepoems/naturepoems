A SUMMER DAY

On the banks of gentle stream, the water gleams,  
The dewdrops cradle in the leaves so shy,  
Birds sing sweetly hidden where the willow dreams,  
They spin their tales of love beneath the sky.  
And as the sun ascends, so gentle, high,  
My heart doth swell, in chorus with the breeze,  
For nature's symphony cannot deny  
A summer's day that lingers with such ease.


- Walter Deverell
