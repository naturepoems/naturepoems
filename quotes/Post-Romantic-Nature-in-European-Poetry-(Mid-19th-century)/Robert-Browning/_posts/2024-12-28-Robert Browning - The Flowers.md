The Flower's Name
  
I.  
  
      "Were I but a flower,  
      On my green stem I’d grow,  
      And, as the hours slow,  
      Wave to and fro,  
      Where the wild winds blow."

II.  
  
      "What’s my name?"  
      the flower said,  
      And to the sun it spread  
      Its petals wide, and fled  
      From the dew that shed.  
      
III.  
  
      "I bloom for you,  
      Sweet morning dew,  
      A marvel through and through  
      To every creature true,  
      In joy anew."  

IV.  
  
      So said the flower,  
      In its fleeting hour,  
      To sun and shower,  
      Each fleeting power,  
      “I bloom, I flower.”
