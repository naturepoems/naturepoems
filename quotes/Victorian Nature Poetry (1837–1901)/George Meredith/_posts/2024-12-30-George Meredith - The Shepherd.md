The Shepherd

There is a land where trees are golden,  
  And water’s sweet for every thirst;  
Where Beauty is its own appointed Guardian  
  'Midst messages of the atom's burst.

Light is a means to an end divine;  
  Beautiful earth, 'twixt heaven and me.  
In voices of girlhood, I hear the lark  
  Sink into twilight—the world to be.

- George Meredith
