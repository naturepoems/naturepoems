The Moon’s Reflection

At night, the moon sings,
a ballad of silver,
blinking softly upon the water,
a mirror of dreams,
calling to the wanderers,
along shadowed paths.

It stirs the heart,
a reminder of the past,
of lovers embracing,
of secrets shared,
as the night unfolds,
a tranquil symphony,
a backdrop of stars.

In its glow, we find solace,
a connection to the cosmos,
a promise that life,
it ebbs and flows,
just like the tides of the ocean,
which knows our names,
carved deep in the sands of time.

- Bertolt Brecht
