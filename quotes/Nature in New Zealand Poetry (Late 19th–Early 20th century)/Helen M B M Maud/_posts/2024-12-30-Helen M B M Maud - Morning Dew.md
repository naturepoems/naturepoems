Morning Dew

Upon the grass, a diamond glints,
Each droplet holds the dawn’s warm breath;
As sunlight spills, the spirit hints
Of life's renewal, soft as death.

The world awakes with whispered light,
Each blade a mirror of the sky,
In quietude, the heart takes flight,
A perfect pause before the sigh.

Come, walk where morning's fingers trace,
In every glance, the beauty stir;
In dew, find nature’s sweet embrace,
And lose yourself in dreams, a blur.

- Helen M B M Maud
