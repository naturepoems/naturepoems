The Forest

O thou dim wood, with your shaded trails,
  Where the lost winds through thy branches roam,
I love the sound of the rain in your sails,
  The whispering leaves that sing of home.

The silence holds in its deep embrace
  Each little bird that sings with glee;
Thy beams, O sun, in the azure space,
  Are love and peace and joy to me.

- Isabella Valancy Crawford
