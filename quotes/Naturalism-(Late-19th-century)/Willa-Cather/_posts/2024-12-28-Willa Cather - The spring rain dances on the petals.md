The spring rain dances on the petals anew,
With laughter and joy upon the soft earth,
As blossoms explode, shaking off winter's dew,
Bringing forth promises of life's rebirth.

Each droplet’s a whisper, each raindrop a song,
In the chorus of nature, a melody bright,
As the world wakes up, where we all belong,
In the gentle embrace of the thriving light.

The warm sun peeks through to offer its grace,
As meadows unfurl in verdant delight,
Here, in this beauty, I find my place,
In the heart of spring's symphony, pure and bright.

So let me roam where the wildflowers bloom,
Through the hills and valleys, over streams and glades,
In nature’s kingdom, there’s no hint of gloom,
For within its embrace, love never fades.

- Willa Cather
