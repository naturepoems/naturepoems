In the Valley

Since I am all in the valley,
  Where the flowers bloom and thriving grasses sway,
  How blue and deep the pool with sunlit rays,
  Where nature's heart beats free and gay!
  Birds whirl,  streams laugh, good thoughts follow!

As life with all its wonders clings,
  I fall with tender eyes,
  Gaze in such softened light.

Oh that I may too be like, free and free!
  And charge with my own nature, laughing too,
  Twinkling light as thy pardon and caress,
  Obliving, while in all my dreams you bless.

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
