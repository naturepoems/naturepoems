Through storms and trials, we shall soar, 
With nature as our steadfast guide; 
The beauty found in every roar, 
A testament of hope inside. 

Let every heartbeat sync with yours, 
In harmony with earth and sky; 
In gardens wild, behind closed doors, 
Forever, you and I shall fly.

- Charles Baudelaire
