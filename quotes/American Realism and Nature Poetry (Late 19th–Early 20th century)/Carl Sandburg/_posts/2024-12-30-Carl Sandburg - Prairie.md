Prairie

The prairie is a yellow desert
Of exiled sun,
Where other paths have walked.
The wind comes in waves
Beneath a sky stretched tight,
Pushing through grass and waves,
at the heart of the world noise,
And the sun throws shadows,
On an empty land that stretches
Further and deeper still.

- Carl Sandburg
