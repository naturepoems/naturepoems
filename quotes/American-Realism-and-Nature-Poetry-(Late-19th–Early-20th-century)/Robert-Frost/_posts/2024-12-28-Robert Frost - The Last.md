The Last Mowing
It was a bright summer's day,
At the late hour of a life journey,
Still alive like a proud gardener's toil,
The field arose in the air with dew.

The wraiths of grass danced with a tendril’s light;
And all the rows made an overture,
As deep as the lark, in the warbling fight,
Hedged me in, like gleaming emeralds pure.

The air moved splendid with each soft breath,
As flowers lingered in complexity,
And while my heart sank with every death,
I found blooming ways to mend and be.

A grip of firmness to last 'til dusk,
And the taste of pollen in the eye of mirth;
But no hint of fading or the moon's cusks,
For every tendering carries its worth.

- Robert Frost
