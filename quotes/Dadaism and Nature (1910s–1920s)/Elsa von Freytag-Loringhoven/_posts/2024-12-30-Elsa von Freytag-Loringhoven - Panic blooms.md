Panic blooms,
   in the marrow,
   where whispers harry
   thorns like arrows --
   fishes seethe in jagged glass.
   Time and silence stir,
   wrapped in the breath of dusk,
   clutching chants in its faded fabric;
   shadows shimmy,
   honey-laced upliftment,
   and rustle the frozen ground.
   O, dial the sun!
   Fill the air with pistils exploding!

- Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven
