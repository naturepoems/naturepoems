At the Ball Game

The little boy

is watching the game

for the first time.

His heart leaps

and dances; he shouts

for the players

and is excited by

every strike and every runâ€”

and the sweet horses
gallop faster above

the grass,

while the lines
drum around him

and the times roll by.

Let the winds carry this

with grace, for the joy

is now!

That is summer. Feeling it

is motion cultivating love

brought forth through colors ever bright!

- William Carlos Williams
