The Brook

The brook in the vale is singing,
And the waters run a-loving all day long;
The streamlets are gaily winging,
And the song of the brook is a joyous song.

They shall now be mine forever,
As I sit in the shade of the linden tree;
With my heart in tune to its singing,
I feel the summer's happiness in my glee.

- John G Whittier
