Summer

The summer sun is high and bright,
The fields are gold with glowing light; 
And nature wears her robe of grace,
While bliss doth linger round the place.

In gardens, all with flowers ripe,
Where honeybees their nectar pipe,
I walk among the fragrant blooms,
Lost in the sweet odorous plumes.

O summer fair, thou art so sweet;
With moments glorious feel our feet.
Around us sings lifeâ€™s merry voice;
In golden shades, we too rejoice!

- John Clare
