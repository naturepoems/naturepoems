The Dead Year

Our Year is dead: away, away,
Like an echo drowned in an endless night,
In the blackened tomb his remorseless sway
Breathes life to an inward, patient light.

Yet never he saw in bitter despair,
The scene I will linger, to meet your gaze,
Like dreams of tomorrows in glimmering air,
His spirit steals forwards, to greet lifeâ€™s rays.

What comes, may linger like leaves of green,
And dance to the rhythm on springtime ground,
Yet, sing, its dead spirit lies unseen,
As a memory speaks when no voices surround!

- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr
