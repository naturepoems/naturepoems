Winter Trees

All the trees

are almost

being

but none are so

as the trees

of winter,

standing skeletal

against a sky

of silver.

Their lives

are just beyond

the whispered wind,

etched in those

fractured lines

that hold us

to this earth,

to this moment,

to each breath.

We must find

our roots there,

breathe those

silent breaths.


- William Carlos Williams
