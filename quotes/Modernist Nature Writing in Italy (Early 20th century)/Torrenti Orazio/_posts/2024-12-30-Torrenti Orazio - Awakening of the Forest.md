Awakening of the Forest

In the quiet hush of dawn's embrace,
The forest stirs, shakes off its night,
With a gentle breeze, the leaves awake,
Singing praises to the softening light.

Moss carpets the earth with lush green,
Every trunk wrapped in vibrant life,
Birds trill their songs, sweet and clear,
Celebrating the end of nightâ€™s strife.

Every creature, large and small,
Finds its place in the awakening song,
In this sacred space where whispers reign,
Nature's chorus is loud, yet strong.

- Torrenti Orazio
