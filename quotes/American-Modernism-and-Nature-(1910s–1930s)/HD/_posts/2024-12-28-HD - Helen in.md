Helen in Egypt

She lifts a flag,  
imagining a myth 
speeding in the skirts  
and fantasies of every man,
her world's reflection;  
all night I see her carry the moon  
in the boat of her desire,  
lost in a dream. 

Let the colors survive,  
one green—  
one balance for earth! 
Push onward the waters against the sun  
that day shall mark the shores!
