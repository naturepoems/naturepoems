When clouds gather,
a veil of grey,
a hush envelops the fields,
hinting of a coming storm.

Yet in that stillness,
there lies a tension,
a breath held taut,
a promise of renewal
as the world waits,
suspended in time,
yearning for the dance of rain.

And when it falls,
heartbeats align with drops,
every splash a testament
to the earthâ€™s return.


- Margherita Guidacci
