To live in this world is a wonderful task,
To appreciate the beauty therein lies a secret:
To call upon the larks just for their song,
To dance along with the wind that belongs,
To breathe the life that teems from the earth,
To write new verses for the melody of the stars.
Let it be true, that nature has much to speak,
That even silence shouts in a whisperâ€™s breath,
That the beauty surrounding us calls for expression,
So let us extend our arms toward the infinite sky.

- Lorine Niedecker
