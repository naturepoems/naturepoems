Songs of the Brook

With gurgling sounds and ripples bright  
The brook sings on by day and night;  
It dances forth, in merry play,  
Through pebbled beds, it winds away.

In fallen leaves it finds a bed,  
And laughs to hear the waters shed;  
From woodland glens to meadows wide,  
It journeys on, a wandering guide.

Each bend reveals a different view,  
As sunlight casts a golden hue;  
The brook doth carry dreamers near,  
To nature’s heart, forever dear.

- Hartley Coleridge
