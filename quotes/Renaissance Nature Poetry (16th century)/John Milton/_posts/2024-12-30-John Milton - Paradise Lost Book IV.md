Paradise Lost, Book IV
Of man’s first disobedience, and the fruit
Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste,
Brought death into the World, and all our woe,
With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,
Sing Heav’nly Muse, that on the secret night
Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire
That shepherd, who first taught the chosen seed
In the Beginning how the Heav’ns and Earth
Rose out of Chaos; or if Sion Hill
Delight thee more, and Siloa’s Brook that flow’d
Fast by the Oracle of God, I thence
Invoke thy aid to my advent’rous Song,
That with no middle flight intends to soar
Above th’ Aonian Mount, while it pursues
Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.
And chiefly, thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
Before all temples th’ upright heart and pure,
Instruct me, for thou know’st; thou from the first
Wast present, and, the morning stars, admired
Thee, and thou, the daily nurtwith sweetest food, prepare
For all that live, and bright wings impart.
Thus I invoke; and now, thy light expound to me,
That I may sing of nature’s law divine.

- John Milton
