The Idea of Order at Key West

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind
Of a single being, not in a gesture,
And not a trace of things seen.

She sang a song, waded deep into the sea, 
And while the sea blocked her spirit,  
The mind of man was formed again  
To shape and urge the perfect hour.

The idea of order at Key West, 
A boxed intensity in hues of light, 
Became the shade: but in her song, 
It was not just the voice, but the sea that spoke.

- Wallace Stevens
