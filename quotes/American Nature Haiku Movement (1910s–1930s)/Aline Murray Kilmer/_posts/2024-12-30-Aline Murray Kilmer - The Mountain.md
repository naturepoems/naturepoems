The Mountain
The mountain’s heart is solemn  
And swells in silence;  
Yet the laughter of the trees
Fills each shadowy reach,  
With whispered secrets told  
To the wind that spins away.  

Let the sun caress your soul,  
Climb to where you feel the whole
earth breathing,  
Where your spirit can soar  
Above the darkened shadows,
Singing with the sky.
