The Nightingale
O nightingale with thy tender chords,
  Encircle hearts in silver rays;
The deep of woods wrapped with thy words,
  Spills melody in moonlit haze.

As shadows mingle with sweet refrain,
  The calm of nature breathes her peace,
Thou weavest joy amidst the pain,
  And in thy song, the heart finds lease.

- Sidney Lanier
