On the Grasshopper and Cricket

The poetry of earth is never dead:
When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,
And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run
From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;

That is the Grasshopper’s—he takes the lead
In summer luxury; he has never done
With his delights; for when tired out with fun,
He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.

The poetry of earth is ceasing never:
   On a lone winter’s evening, when the frost
   Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills
   The Cricket’s song, in warmth increasing ever,
   And seems to one in drinking to be lost
   In his own joy, to hear the chilly hills.

— *On the Grasshopper and Cricket*

- John Keats
