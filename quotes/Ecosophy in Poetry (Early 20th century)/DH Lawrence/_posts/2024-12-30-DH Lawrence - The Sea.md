The Sea

The sea is not a snapshot,  
It is a change,  
A tumbling surf,  
Transcending into spaces unknown,  
Flowing in cobalt waves  
Inch by inch, unyielding.

It churns beyond the sun,  
With a shushing hue,  
Echoes whisper distance,  
Call of its newborn depth—  
Harnessing the very tide  
Of every creature lost within.

— D.H. Lawrence
