The sun was warm and the wind was chill,  
You know how it is with an April day  
When the sun is out and the wind is still,  
You're one month on in the middle of May.  

But it’s summer love when we can dare  
To know what woodlands upon the lakes  
And warming wood a son in stretch shall bear;  
You feel the hewn of summer, firm and wide,  

Not to this song but to that familiar sigh  
We hold within the pose of living near  
And always come back here on a day like that.  

Tonight sweet summer brings the rose  
From woods I’ve known to be the sun’s delight.  
And yet somehow we come and go—and do not go out.

- Robert Frost
