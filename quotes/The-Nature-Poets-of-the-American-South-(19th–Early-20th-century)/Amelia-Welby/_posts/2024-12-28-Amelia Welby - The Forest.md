The Forest Primeval

In the quiet hall of the ancient wood,
Where creatures stir beneath the leaves,
The whispers of the earth's own mood,
Are woven into verdant eves.

The sunbeams trickle through the bough,
Like liquid gold to bless the ground,
And softly on each fern and prow,
A gentle peace in union found.

Nature’s temple, pure and grand,
With every breath, I feel her grace,
In stillness lies a sacred land,
The forest’s heart, my resting place.

- Amelia Welby
