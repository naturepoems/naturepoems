Lines Written in the Album at Elbingerode
Alas! the joys, the wants, the woes,
That where we live fluctuate.

Yet would I wish thee, Friend, to know
That I could raise my head to sing
Unto the woodlands and to the night.

But the heart knows hardly solace,
Though perpetual and eternal Light.

- Samuel Taylor Coleridge
