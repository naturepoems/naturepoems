Autumn’s Echo

In the autumn’s gentle whisper,
Leaves of gold and red do fall,
Nature’s breath, a soft, sweet shiver,
Her harvest time enfolds us all.

The days grow short, the nights grow long,
In every shade and hue,
Sing ye now, a soft, sweet song,
Of love and life anew.

- Rosa Zagnoni Marinone
