Wilderness

The lifeblood crowling,  
always digging deep,  
     natureâ€™s pages,
     chased by calloused hands.  

The wild has no need 
     for the cry of voices,  
like the roots  
     that wrap  
arounds stones;  
     softening the jolt 
     slowly growing  
in the most barren earth.

- R S Thomas
