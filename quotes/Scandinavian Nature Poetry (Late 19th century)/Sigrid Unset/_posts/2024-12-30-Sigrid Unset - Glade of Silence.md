In shadowed glades where silence reigns,
The heartbeat of the earth remains.
In nature's pulse, our own sustains,
A unity that ever gains.

The forging streams, their waters clear,
Invite the wanderer to draw near.
With every step, the soul will cheer,
In nature's vastness, long and dear.

- Sigrid Unset
