The winter sky hangs heavy with snow,
A world transformed, quiet and slow.
Each flake a whisper, a delicate lace,
On evergreens holding winter's grace.

In this stillness, time bends and breaks,
Nature pauses, as the heart awakes.
A blanket of white, soft and profound,
Truth in the silence, where peace is found.

- Dunstan Thompson
