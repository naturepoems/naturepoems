The Last of the Night
In twilight's hush, the earth lies bare,
Where stars awaken, fine and rare,
Nature holds her breath, then sighs,
As darkness drapes the starlit skies.

With every sound a whisper shared,
In silence wrapped, hearts bared,
The night confesses through the leaves,
Where nature, too, her soul believes.

- Edward Thomas
