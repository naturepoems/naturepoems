The Invitation to the Voyage

My child, my sister,
Think how sweet it would be
To wander there together,
To love at our leisure,
Our hearts bathed in the sun,
And to our minds, untroubled,
Let float our thoughts borne freely.

There, all is only order and beauty,
Luxury, peace, and sensuality.

The summer’s sunshine,
Presses on bright blossomed trees,
Inviting us, flowers—allied,
Eager to breathe deep the scented skies.

There, all is only order and beauty,
Luxury, peace, and sensuality.


- Charles Baudelaire
