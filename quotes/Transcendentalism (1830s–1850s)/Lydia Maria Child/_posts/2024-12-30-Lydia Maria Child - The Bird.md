THE BIRD

The bird is singing high and clear,
Upon the bough, beneath the sky,
Her melody is joy to hear,
As she takes wing, and soars on high.

For in her song there lies a voice,
That tells of spring's abundant grace,
With every note, the heart rejoices,
In nature's warm and soft embrace.

Oh bird, sweet messenger of peace!
Thy song shall echo far and wide,
For in thy melody's release,
Our souls take flight, and will abide.

- Lydia Maria Child
