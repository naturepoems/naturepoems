A FORGOTTEN SONNET

Once wandered I through valley deep,  
Where golden tides of sunlight play,
And secrets of the shadows seep
Into the ground where wildflowers sway.

The silence whispers, soft and sweet,  
And echoes of the lost resound,
For in this place, our hearts will meet
In a world where joy and peace abound.  


- A E Housman
