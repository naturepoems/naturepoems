New Beginnings

Awakened by light in the coldest of days,
Nature’s breath stirs in the softest of songs,
With each fragile bud, spring silently lays
The promise of life where the soul belongs.
Awakened by light in the coldest of days.

The cycle continues with hope intertwined,
From ashes of winter, fresh blooms arise,
Nature's canvas, magnificently designed,
In every flower, the promise of skies.
The cycle continues with hope intertwined.

- Roger Fry
