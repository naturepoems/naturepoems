Nature, the Gentlest Mother is,  
Impatient of no Child,  
The feeblest, or the waywardest,  
Her admonition mild  

In forest and the hill  
By traveller is heard,  
Restricted by the eye of God  
So that no thought can stir.  

She's got a deep and silly understanding,  
And fills the other ways  
She hears the dumb and straight  
The finger of the bright sun wakes.

- Emily Dickinson
