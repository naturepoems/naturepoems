Thou art not lovelier than lilacs,
Nor honeysuckle, nor
The violets, nor the moss
That covers the stones.
Thou art not lovelier than the moon,
Nor the stars, nor the mist,
Nor the dew that falls from the night,
Nor the rivers that run.
Thou art not lovelier than love,
Nor laughter, nor the tears,
Nor the sea that rolls on the shore,
Nor the wind that blows in the trees.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
