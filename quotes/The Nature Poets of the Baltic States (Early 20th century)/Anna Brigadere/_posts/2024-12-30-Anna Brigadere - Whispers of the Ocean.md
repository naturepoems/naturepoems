The ocean speaks in a soft, rolling tide,
Whispers of what lies beyond the shore.
In its shimmering depths, the wonders abide,
A cradle of stories, forevermore.

With the dance of the waves and the call of the breeze,
The sea forms a bond with the sky.
And there, in that harmony, the soul finds its ease,
Where the land and the waters comply.

- Anna Brigadere
