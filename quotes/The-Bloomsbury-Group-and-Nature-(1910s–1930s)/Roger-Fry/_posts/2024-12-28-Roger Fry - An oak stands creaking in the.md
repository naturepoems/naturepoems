An oak stands creaking in the breeze,
Its branches sway like ancient trees,
And roots delve deep in earth's embrace,
A tribute to the past's warm grace.

The sun through leaves doth dance and sway,
In the tapestry of light's ballet,
Each whispering breeze a sacred song,
Of nature’s theatre, vast and strong.


- Roger Fry
