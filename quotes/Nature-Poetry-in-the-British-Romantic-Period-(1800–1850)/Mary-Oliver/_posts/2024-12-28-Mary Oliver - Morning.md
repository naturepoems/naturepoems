Morning Poem
Every morning
I shake my hair
and step out of the house,
into the lushness
of the silver air.
The breeze carries
whispers of dew
and the sun livening me,
opens to wonder,
while I continue to spin
into the dance of the trees,
into the birdsong, waking
and moving freely,
within this wildness.
What miracle is this?
What grace has taken hold
of a heart struck hard,
and blessed this smile?

- Mary Oliver
