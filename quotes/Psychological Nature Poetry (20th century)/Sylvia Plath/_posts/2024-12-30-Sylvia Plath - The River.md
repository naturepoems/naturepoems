The river flows, an honest stream,
  Over rocks and pebbles, swirling,
  Dancing with the light that falls,
  The shadows stretching warm on banks,
  Where memories drift like reeds,
  Tied to places we must let go.
  Yet I feel its pull; it calls
  To depths we dare not faceâ€”
  The sorrow, the beauty, the forever-ness.

- Sylvia Plath
