Each and All

The friend of man must be a tree,
A spirit standing still and true;
It echoes with a melody,
In sacred peace, it gives what's due.

Let the clouds with shadow, rise,
And sink the day in cool retreat,
Each leaf gives the glad surprise,
Of Cosmos, the incomplete.

Nourishing breath and tender dew,
Will be the offering to the night.
What a cadence found anew,
In the wild heart of nature's plight.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
