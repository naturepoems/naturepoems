Autumn Leaves

Crimson and gold,
The leaves start to fall,
In a whisper of wind,
They answer the call.

The trees stand in glory,
In their brilliant array,
As the earth dons a cloak,
Of colors on display.

Oh autumn, dear autumn,
With your beauty so rife,
You teach us of change,
In the cycle of life.

- John Thompson
