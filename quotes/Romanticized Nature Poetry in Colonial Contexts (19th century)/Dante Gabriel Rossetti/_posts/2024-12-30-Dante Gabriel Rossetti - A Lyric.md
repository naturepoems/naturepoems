A Lyric

I
  A blossom floats on nature's air,
     With petals bright and scented grace;
     Among the leaves, it blooms so fair,
     An ode to life, a soft embrace.

II
  Beyond the dawn and golden hue,
     In springtime's arms, my heart shall dwell,
     On every flower, thy love renew,
     In fragrant whispers, sweet and well.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
