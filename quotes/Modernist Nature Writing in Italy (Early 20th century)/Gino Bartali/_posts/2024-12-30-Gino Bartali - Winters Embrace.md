In winter's grasp,  
a blanket of white  
covers the world,  
a tranquil stillness;  
trees wear crowns of frost,  
their branches stooped,  
a gentle burden,  
a moment of reflection.  

Each breath a cloud,  
a reminder of warmth,  
as nature slumbers,  
a sacred pause,  
a lull before the bloom.

- Gino Bartali
