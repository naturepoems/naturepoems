author: Ezra Pound
quote: "A single flower rises proud,  
   amidst the chaos of the field,  
   determination in its bloom.
    
   Untamed beauty, wild and free,  
   reaching for the sun above,  
   a testament to life's resolve."

A single flower rises proud,  
   amidst the chaos of the field,  
   determination in its bloom.
    
   Untamed beauty, wild and free,  
   reaching for the sun above,  
   a testament to life's resolve.

- Ezra Pound
