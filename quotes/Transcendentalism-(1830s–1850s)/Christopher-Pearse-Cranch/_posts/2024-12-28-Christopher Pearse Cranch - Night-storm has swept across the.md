Night-storm has swept across the wilderness.
A lonely soul upon the dreary hill—
Gazed forth on windswept plains, and paths that bless
The rugged boughs that tremble—sentinel still.

Yet, in the dark, the canopy entwined
With raucous cries, yet soft as pain's caress,
Composed of thoughts that linger unconfined,
Adorn the treetops with ethereal dress.

And in the silence, dreams resign the night,
To temper sound with nature's hidden grace,
As palms uplifted bare to gray twilight—
Invite the luminescence of space. 

Let nature lead my heart to peaceful rest,
As flickering stars become her wayward guests.

- Christopher Pearse Cranch
