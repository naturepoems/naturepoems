Under the great vault of the azure sky,
Each star a whispered secret of the night;
The moon's silver gaze caresses the earth,
Painting the world in shades of enchantment.

Beneath the shadows of ancient trees,
Where stories linger in the air like sighs,
Natureâ€™s heartbeat echoes a sacred truth,
Every pulse is a breath of eternity.

- Anna de Noailles
