The brook leaps down its wending way,
Dancing in the light of day;
It takes the sunbeams on its back,
And sings a song while on its track.

With every stone, it leaps and bounds,
With murmurs soft, with joyful sounds;
It knows not of the worldâ€™s great cares,
But lives in joy, free from all snares.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
