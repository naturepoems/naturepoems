The Thistle

The thistle is a thorny thing,
    As thorny as a man can be;
Yet in the flowers some nectar clings,
    And in the thorn some poetry.

A yearning for the distant sea
    Has come upon me in the night;
I cannot see the light of day
    I listen for the music bright.

But it is not the waves I hear,
    It is only the thistleâ€™s bane;
And yet, I cannot but draw near
    To that which fills my heart with pain.

- John Shaw Neilson
