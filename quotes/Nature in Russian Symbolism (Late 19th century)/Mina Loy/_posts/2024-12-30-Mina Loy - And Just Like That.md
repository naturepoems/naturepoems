And Just Like That
Flecks in warmed pools respect;
the weight, it effigies the softer sun.
speakers near the clear crescent bay,
wrapped in star-born tranquil sheets,
shall breathe measure in time,
step after step within the shining hours;
casting forth quick reflections,
crystal-soft summer leans down.
It sets forth the crystal images,
a deft exposure of colors.
What is nature abounds, where twilight
is like a tale unwound,
everyone should be here tune. 



- Mina Loy
