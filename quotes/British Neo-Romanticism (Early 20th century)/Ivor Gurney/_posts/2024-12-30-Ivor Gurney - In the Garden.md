In the Garden

                   Among the blooms where fresh air greets,
                   I hear the buzzing and chirping leads,
                   The roses arch with scent divine,
                   Whispering secrets that intertwine.
                   
                   In petals soft, the sun's bright kiss,
                   The honey bee shares in this bliss,
                   Each fragrant bloom a note, a key,
                   Unlocks joy in harmony.
                   
                   O Nature's keeper, do not bid,
                   To part from here, where comfort slid,
                   For in this garden, peace imparts,
                   And blooms eternally in hearts.

- Ivor Gurney
