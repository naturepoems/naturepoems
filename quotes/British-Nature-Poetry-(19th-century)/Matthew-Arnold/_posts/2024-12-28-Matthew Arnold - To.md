To Marguerite—Continued

Yes, in the sea of life enisled,
With echoing straits between us thrown,
Like foamy waves, white with the sun,
What, can we know if these waves run
So that we can hear each other’s calls
And rush from storm to storm, alone?

Leaves of the trees where light runs through;
No hunger for green, and crystal air;
Clouds deep of grey, a sky bright blue;
Yet hark! the winds from out the sea
Winds that moan ever, sat you there,
There, on the cliff, not far, and near.

And so, we sail through life apart,
With only just enough to know
That we are cast in wave and spray,
Alone, and may one day find our way
With cliffs behind us, waters clear,
To find, again, those dreams you see.

With what heart could we hope to chart
The essence of the shared soul’s glow,
When I, too, am all alone, apart,
And heard wild echoes stumble in the glow,
What would it bring, a enlighten hand,
How fair the waves would glide, if we could stand?

- Matthew Arnold
