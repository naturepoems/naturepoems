The Virginia and Charleston             

Hands over the thick sun lifts,
white grapes leaf warming, 
while the lovely glide unfolds,
behind the ship as it sails. 
And the ripples pass,
along still sides, with the sound of seas;  
like sailor’s pants raising,
they walk down long to spring me off the road. 
So slow I sway as I behold,
that lingers slipping toward the gaslight, 
so cool their leaves float magically out!
Riding haze, bright with long side, now with a darkening edge.

At long last, heavier clouds return.
Hold writing here, down both sides, they are all mine,  
ow I’m floating while you whiff.
And catching gentle patterns, all the stones care,  
and close the light out of my home, 
lazy and milky, while still below.
So send your shadows, pale and old,
the records creeping, gently speckled between.

Because I am rooted; comes like dawn,
making only the withered glow;  
from all sensations dowsing—
may I come to realize  
like destiny nearer in silence.
Let the moon rise forth—hold from my room—
old hills at last quelling through the star-streak,
so very far behind.+
I am whatever you may feel now!
All kinds march round at the wheel so large and far,
that head the stone, and sea may sail anew.”
As distance fades, I sway, bodies—
nothing is valid while we float!

- Elizabeth Bishop
