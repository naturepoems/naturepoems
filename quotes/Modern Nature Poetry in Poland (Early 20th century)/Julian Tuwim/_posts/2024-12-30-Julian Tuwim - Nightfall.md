Night has fallen, silent and deep,
Stars like scattered grains of sand,
The moon bathes the world in silver,
A soft touch of the divine hand.

A rustle in the bushes nearby,
A nightingaleâ€™s lullaby sings,
Crickets play in a gentle choir,
While the night enfolds all things.

Mysteries unfold in shadows,
Where the wild creatures roam and breathe,
Under starlit skies, nature covers
The whispers, dreams interweave.

- Julian Tuwim
