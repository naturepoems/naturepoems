Rain

The rain it raineth every day,
Upon the just and unjust fella,
But for me the joy of this grey,
Is the pulse of life through every cella.

It sends the flowers up to greet,
And in the puddles, mirrors show,
An echoing of soft retreat,
With ripples dancing to and fro.

The earth awakens with its thirst,
From roots that yearn for sweet release,
To quench the burn and hold the burst,
In Nature's rhythmic, wild peace.

How soft the droplets kiss the skin,
As every element shall blend,
A melding of where we begin,
In rain, where dreams and life ascend.

- Edward Thomas
