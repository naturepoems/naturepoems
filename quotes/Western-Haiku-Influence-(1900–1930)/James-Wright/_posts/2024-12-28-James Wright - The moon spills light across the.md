quote: "The moon spills light across the sleeping fields, 
A soft hush dawns over the restless night, 
In the stillness, a coyote calls out, 
Awakening echoes of a wandering past, 
Here in the embrace of silence, I breathe deep."

The moon spills light across the sleeping fields, 
A soft hush dawns over the restless night, 
In the stillness, a coyote calls out, 
Awakening echoes of a wandering past, 
Here in the embrace of silence, I breathe deep.

- James Wright
