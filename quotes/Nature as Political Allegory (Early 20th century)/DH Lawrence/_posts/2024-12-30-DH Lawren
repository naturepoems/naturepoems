Spring

And suddenly, spring appears,
Draped in a flourish of colors so bright,
From crocus to daffodil, life bursts forth,
Emerging from winter’s long grasp, the light.

In richness and tenderness, vibrant hues,
Every petal sings the joy of rebirth,
As the world awakens in gentle awe,
Nature’s promise — a renewal of earth.


- DH Lawrence
