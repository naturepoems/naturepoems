Let America Be America Again

Let America be America again.
Let it be the dream it used to be.
Let it be the pioneer on the plain
Sinking in the storm with the dream's shadow.

Let it be the milkweed on the lake,
The bramble in the meadows at night,
Let it be a place of love,
And of the sun.

- Langston Hughes
