The River

Is a white lace contouring land,
Capsizing beads of bright roll-over shores,
Northern skies lace each stretch with a fine edge,
Split through swollen reaches of sudden stream.

Quickly, it flirts under the nesting trees,
With crooned touches of the joyous lilies,
Henching and bowing over bended grasses,
At times, holding radiant shines of secret lace.

Each foot breaks within the soft currents,
The feeling of energy, soft on the bright glimmer,
Generously slower, and that unheard sigh
Hums under a lilt that softly trails by willows.

And as shadows take shapes, glinting light shines
Upon clusters formed in the calling clouds,
Filling each line across rested plains like strokes,
Reminding still, every bit of grain in night-red air.
