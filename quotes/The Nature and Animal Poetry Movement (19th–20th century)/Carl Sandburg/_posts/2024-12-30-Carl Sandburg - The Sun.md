Like a great red star
turning in the sky
I see the sun
in her great sphered dress,
folded fuchsia as a rose,
a myriad winds
blown from afar
as she lifts her arms in prayer.

I see
her arms of light,
I see
her commas of leaves,
and I see
her curves
in my head,
aicracked away to Spain,
made like a song.

Oh, to sing her light,
to swell my voice
into her miauleen song
as she lifts her arms
high on a ladder
of soft wind.

- Carl Sandburg
