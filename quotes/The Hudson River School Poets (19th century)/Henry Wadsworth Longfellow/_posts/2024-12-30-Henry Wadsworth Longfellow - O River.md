O river! with the flowing tide 
You carry my heart along your side;
You steal my thoughts, my quiet dreams, 
And transport them to your native streams.

Where the willows weep and bask 
In the bright sun’s whisper, sweet,
Blend your voices, as the heaven’s tear 
Shall make rich all that you greet.

You are a friend; through the thickest of trees, 
A gentle current brings the breeze,
Thus together we flow, rivers entwined,
Forever companions, spirit aligned.


- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
