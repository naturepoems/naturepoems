The oak stands forth among the trees,
A proud, majestic, timeless king.
Opposed by willowâ€™s swaying breeze,
He swells with pride; his branches ring.

He gathers strength from earth and sun,
An everlasting sheltering grace.
Though storms may rage and winds may run,
He knows his strength will hold its place.

- Joyce Kilmer
