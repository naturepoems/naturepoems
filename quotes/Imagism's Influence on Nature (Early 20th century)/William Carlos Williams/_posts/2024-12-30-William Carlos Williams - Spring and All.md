Spring and All
By the road to the contagious hospital
under the surge of the blue
mottled clouds

that is in the air—
there is a brown
grim stone—
a mother’s hands

beside the green
a tall tree—
with wiry white
and growing weak,
yet so wide alone.

Of fruit and nectar.
No wonder they remain
in their maroon of
fragile colors,

like webs of iron.

As the trees grow dim—
there comes a spring,
the wind

is wiping the fire
from the light.

With deep creatures—
into my capacity,
There are stings
(toward the light).

So all at once,
the way,
yearned on the grass,
arc.

To everyone—

A search for an older
man—the bloom,
weeds, but few trees,

unfurled.

Hidden brightly.

- William Carlos Williams
