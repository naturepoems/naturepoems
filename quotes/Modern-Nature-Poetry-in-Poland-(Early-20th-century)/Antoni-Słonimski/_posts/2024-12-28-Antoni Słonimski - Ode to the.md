Ode to the Sun

O, Solar King, great fiery ball,
Your golden rays weave light across the sky,
Dancing on the waves, they rise and fall,
Painting the world with warmth as time flies by.

Through the ether, your warmth wraps around,
A soft embrace that awakens the day,
Under your gaze, life unfolds, unbound,
In blooms and leaves, nature’s grand ballet.

Golden morn, noon's vibrant hue, 
Evening's glow, twilight’s embrace,
You brighten all with energy anew,
In your presence, adversity has no place.

As shadows retreat and colors ignite,
We honor your journey—a splendid flight.
