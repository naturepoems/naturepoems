The Summer Wind
The summer wind does softly play,
In silence of the dusky day;
It sweeps the meadow, bends the grass,
And makes the shady willows pass.
Each leaf does flutter in delight,
As whispers meld with the coming night;
Oh give me the peacefulness that flows,
From nature’s hand that sweetly shows.
