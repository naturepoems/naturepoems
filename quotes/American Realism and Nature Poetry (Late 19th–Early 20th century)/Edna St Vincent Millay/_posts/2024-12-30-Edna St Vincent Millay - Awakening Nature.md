As day breaks forth, the world is still,
The sun awakens, and new dreams fill;
With every breath, I taste the morn,
In Nature’s cradle, I am reborn.

The world unfolds in colors bright,
With every petal, my soul takes flight;
In Nature’s touch, my heart shall thrive,
The beauty here, I’m glad to be alive.


- Edna St Vincent Millay
