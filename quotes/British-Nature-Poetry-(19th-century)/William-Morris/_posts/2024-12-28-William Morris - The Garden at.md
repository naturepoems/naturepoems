The Garden at Evening

In the twilight hour, a still, soft sigh,
                The garden waits in silence deep,
Where shadows roll like clouds on high,
                And the blooms, in evening, weep.

Stillness holds each flower’s gaze,
                The air thick with perfume’s art;
In dusk's embrace, the heart arrays,
                The wonders of the garden’s heart.


- William Morris
