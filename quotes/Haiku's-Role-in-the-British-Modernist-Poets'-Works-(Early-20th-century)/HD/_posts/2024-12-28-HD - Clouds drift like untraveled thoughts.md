decaying leaves whisper of time's gentle hand,
where the brook's laughter collides with the silence,
a memory pulses between the pulse of the land."

Clouds drift like untraveled thoughts across the meadow,
decaying leaves whisper of time's gentle hand,
where the brook's laughter collides with the silence,
a memory pulses between the pulse of the land.
