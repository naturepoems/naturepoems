A Summer Night


  Twilight descends, and is broken  
  On the green hills of the West;  
  The stars to their places have spoken,  
  And the sun as a god is rest;  
  Ever and ever, till the heart of the night  
  Is pulseless, and high, and bright.


  Through the russet and gold of the river,  
  There waft as a senseless soul,  
  The whispers and ripples of silver,  
  Of the ghosts of the waters that roll;  
  Somehow it seems that is part of my home,  
  The creaking of wand and the dome.


  Where I have my hour and my season,  
  And life with my priests hath respect;  
  A beauty so past our reason,  
  A dream that we do not reject;  
  The happiness is more than pity,  
  For life is but one of the rose.


  In all are the shadows and shades of the trees —  
  The spun-silver isle is still and fair,  
  The night has the pure virgin ease;  
  Oh, darkness that shows us so clearly  
  Our beautiful cares with a charm!  
  Forever, forever, to hold us—thee near  
  Am I in a fruit-laden arm.
