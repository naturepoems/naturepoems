The Garden

There are too many flowers,  
     too many scents,  
     too many petals drifting;  
     there is too much color,  
     and the sun bathes it all in sweet warmth,  
     where a single bloom  
     can bring the heart  
     into a frenzy.  
     I fall into the tangled joy  
     of life and time,  
     the hurried comings and goings,  
     and it is a dream  
     woven with sunlight.  
     I bend down hereâ€”  
     love all the small blossoms,  
     for they know me,  
     and I breathe in their warmth,  
     a comfort held close.

- Mary Oliver
