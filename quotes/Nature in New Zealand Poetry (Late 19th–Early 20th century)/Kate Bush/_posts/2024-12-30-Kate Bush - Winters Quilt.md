When the world slumbers beneath a winter quilt,
every breath a puff of warm smoke.

Shimmering particles dance in the still air,
a kaleidoscope of white, of silver, of blue.

Nature's hush descends, soft and eternal,
as we wrap ourselves in cozy warmth.

Time holds still; let us linger here,
in the deep kiss of a winter's night.

- Kate Bush
