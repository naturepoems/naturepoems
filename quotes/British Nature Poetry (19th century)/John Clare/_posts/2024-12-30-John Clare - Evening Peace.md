The sun descends beyond the hills,
   The dew descends upon the grass,
And lightest clouds when daylight spills,
   Are glowing soft as evening pass.

All Nature seems to rest with me,
   So still, so bright, and wondrous fair,
As if the world in harmony
   A day in peace without a care.

- John Clare
