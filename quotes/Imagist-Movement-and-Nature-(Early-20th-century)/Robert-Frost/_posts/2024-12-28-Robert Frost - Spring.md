Spring Pools

These pools that, though in forests, still reflect
The total sky almost without defect,
And like the flowers beside them, chill and shiver,
Though what’s beyond them is the hill and river,

And if the trees beside them can be seen
To look a little in the sky they lean,
What’s it all to the day’s work? to be  there.
They are always there reflecting in the air.

- Robert Frost
