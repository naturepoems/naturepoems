Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird

I
Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.

II
I stood in the cold,
And the blackbird was in the bow,
Watching as the sun rose upon the snowy peaks.

III
The blackbird whistled
In the chill light of the day,
Reacting to the winter wind.

IV
I could imagine him looking,
Looking as I looked,
About the snowy landscape,
But of course he could fly.



- Wallace Stevens
