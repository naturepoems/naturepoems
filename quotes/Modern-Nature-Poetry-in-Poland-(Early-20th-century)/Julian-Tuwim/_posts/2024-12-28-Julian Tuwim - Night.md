Night
Underneath the vast cerulean sky,
stars scatter like thoughts unseen,
each a flicker of eternity.
Silence blankets the world,
moonlight spills into my dreams.
Natureâ€™s secrets whisper,softly,
and all of life seems to breathe,
as if time holds no meaning,
and the universe unfolds
its mysteries in the dark.


- Julian Tuwim
