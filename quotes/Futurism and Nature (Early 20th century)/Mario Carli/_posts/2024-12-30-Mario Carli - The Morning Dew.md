The Morning Dew
At dawn, the world glistens with dew,
Tiny orbs, shimmering jewels,
Adorning leaves and petals alike,
A delicate embrace of morning,
As sunlight stretches,
Kissing the grass awake,
Each droplet holds a reflection,
A moment captured,
In nature's fleeting hours,
The promise of a new day,
Where every breath is filled,
With possibility,
And the earth awakens,
To its rhythm,
A gentle reminder,
Of the beauty of beginnings.


- Mario Carli
