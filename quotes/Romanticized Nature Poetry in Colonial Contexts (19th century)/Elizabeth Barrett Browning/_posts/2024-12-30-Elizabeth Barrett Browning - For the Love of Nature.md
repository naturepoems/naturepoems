O my soul! see how the forests loom,
With arms stretched out in prayer to God.
See how the streams do dance with tune,
In joy to flow upon the sod.

The sunlight breaks apart the cloud,
As wisdom glimmers on the hills,
I hear the rustling whispers loud,
And breathe the air that heals and thrills.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
