quote: "The Negro Speaks of Rivers
I've known rivers:
Ancient, dusky rivers.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

As a child, I gazed
Into the waters,
Painted with the colors of time
Flowing softly, deep over the stones."

The Negro Speaks of Rivers
I've known rivers:
Ancient, dusky rivers.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

As a child, I gazed
Into the waters,
Painted with the colors of time
Flowing softly, deep over the stones.

- Langston Hughes
