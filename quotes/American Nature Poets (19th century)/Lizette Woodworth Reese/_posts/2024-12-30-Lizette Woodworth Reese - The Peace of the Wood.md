The Peace of the Wood

The peace of the wood is deep and still,
   With shadows long and white;
While the heart of the flowers always will
   Find purpose in the night.

For here I find the pathways clear,
   Each step a soulful breath;
The world outside may shiver in fear,
   But trees will conquer death.

In every rustling bough above,
   Is wisdom old and true;
And in each petalâ€™s gentle love,
   I find a world anew.

- Lizette Woodworth Reese
