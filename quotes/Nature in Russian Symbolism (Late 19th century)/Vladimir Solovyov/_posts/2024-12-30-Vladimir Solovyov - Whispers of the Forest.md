The forest glimmers in the light,
A tapestry of leaves and sights,
Where every brook and whispering breeze
Weaves the quiet song of the trees.

Tender whispers, shadowed sighs,
Calling through sunlit, azure skies;
Nature's palette, rich and deep,
In her arms, the world does sleep.

- Vladimir Solovyov
