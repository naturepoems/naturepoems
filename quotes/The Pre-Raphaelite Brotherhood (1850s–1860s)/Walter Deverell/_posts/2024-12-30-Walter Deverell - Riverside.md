RIVERSIDE

Upon the riverside, with gentle grace,  
Where waters flow, and secrets murmur low,  
The willow weeps in time with nature’s pace,  
And dances softly in the sunset’s glow.  
Here every sigh shall linger, ebb and flow,  
As if the very earth, in love, confides,  
Each drop a story only time can show,  
Within the riverside, where beauty hides.


- Walter Deverell
