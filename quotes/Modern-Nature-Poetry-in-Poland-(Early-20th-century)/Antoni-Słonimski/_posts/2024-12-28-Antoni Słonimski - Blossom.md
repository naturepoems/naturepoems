Blossom

The cherry tree, adorned in lace,
Pinks and whites ‘gainst sky of blue,
A fleeting ballad, time's embrace,
In spring's warm chorus, life renew.

Petals drift, a soft ballet,
On gentle breath of winds they sail,
An echo of bright, fleeting day,
In beauty’s grasp, no sorrow’s tale.

Beneath this blooming canopy,
Hope unfolds with every glance,
As fragrance carries memory,
Through blossoms sweet, our hearts do dance.
