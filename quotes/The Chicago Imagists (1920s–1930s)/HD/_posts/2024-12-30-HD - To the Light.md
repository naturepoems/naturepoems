To the Light

Light of the sky,
you are heavy on my face,
for many a hundred years,
you have risen and strode,
till now honey splash me silky night.
So bright light that glows,
your soft hand of the wave,
you have lighted with green touch of flowers,
with gentle blooms and hues.
May I grow into the cool warmth,
for the dark shall yield a sun,
as you cover me now,
with your hand, daylight wilfully—  

all this will lead down paths of dreams.
