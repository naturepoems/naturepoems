Adlestrop

Yes, I remember Adlestrop -
The name, because one afternoon
Of heat the express train drew up there
Unwontedly. It was late June.

The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.
    No one left, and no one came
On the bare platform. What I saw
    Was Adlestrop - only the name.

And willows, willow-herb, and grass,
    And meadowsweet, and haycocks dry,
   And the old, old, houses looked at last
    Like the end of the sky.

Too?    Only the name.
I never saw it before, 
Or after. No longer were we in
    The year of heat, that afternoon.

And waiting - then, the frosted air,
And without fear of what would start,
    Or where I go - the function lay
    Not him alone, but with my heart.

- Edward Thomas
