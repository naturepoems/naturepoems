The Pastor's Garden
In a calm spot on the hill,  
Where blossoms bloom untroubled still,  
A little garden looks around  
On valleys deep with shades profound.

Here evening whispers soft and low,  
As breezes waft the scents of flow'r,  
While birds sing sweetly every hour,  
And all is peaceful in its bower.

- Felicia Hemans
