The Silences
In the silence that broods on the night,
As the stars are yielding the space  
For the moon with her pallor and might,
And the vastness of sky leaves no trace,

I drop from my shadows untold  
Where the mind makes no error to speak,
To the solitude, glistening and cold,
Where a symphony whispers so weak.

- Dorothea Mackellar
