Out in the Wild

Out in the wild where the winds are sweet,
   I long for the trees and the soft, cool ground;
The whispering leaves, the brook’s gentle beat,
   Here is the peace that my heart has found.

The sun dips low, the shadows grow tall,
   Each moment is woven with nature’s thread;
In this quiet place, I hear the call,
   Of freedom, of beauty, of intimate dread.

- Marjorie Pickthall
