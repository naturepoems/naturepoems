When I Have Fears
Before my pen has gleam'd upon the page,
Before high-piled books, in charred-out night,
With visions pouring free; I have not found
The safety I have yearned, nor halcyon sight.

In gardens under blossomed boughs,
Trapped amidst the glades, I long to leap
Into the joys that fill the heart,
As dreams pour down from heaven, like spring’s sweet dew.

Yet, when the winds shift and skies insist
That time is But a fleeting breath;
Away from all I seek, take Flight
And lose myself, around the flowery wreath.


- John Keats
