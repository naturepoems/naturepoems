Iris

In the garden bright with splendor,  
Amidst the blooms of every hue,  
I met the lovely Iris,  
Her glory sparkling, fresh and new.

With petals of azure, soft as lace,  
Nature’s own sweet symphony,  
A promise of rain, and sun’s warm embrace,  
Iris sang her song with glee.

Her fragrance filled the gentle air,  
And with her presence, joy began,  
In quiet moments I found her there,  
A symbol of the heart’s pure plan.

- Lydia Sigourney
