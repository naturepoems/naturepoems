The Mournful Rain

Rain mist-filled dreams  
fall quiet on the flowers' eyes,  
broken before the soft  
morning calls.  

A dropping mist over the chestnuts;  
the earth converses in waves  
as tears caress with abandon.  

Yet, when we see the storm  
behind waves of sorrow,  
we find the beauty of life  
at the pointer biting flame.  

So as skies weep over woods,  
how do we cherish memory yet  
nature regains  
a cycle of love mirrored?

- Gabriela Mistral
