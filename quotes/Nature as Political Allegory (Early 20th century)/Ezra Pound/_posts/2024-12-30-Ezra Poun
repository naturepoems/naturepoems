The Old Woman
  In the old woman's arms, who knows it is night,
  Her pulse evokes what the quiet holds,
  As each leaf falls forgotten in the twilight —  
  And silence’s path—you can see, in the space of days
  That she speaks of truth and sobering rest,
  In each breath the softness recalls,
  What earth and sky and call do net.


- Ezra Pound
