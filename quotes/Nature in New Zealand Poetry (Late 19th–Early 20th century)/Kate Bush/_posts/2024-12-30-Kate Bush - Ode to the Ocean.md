Seas of golden sand stretch wide,
a horizon kissing the curve of the world.

Waves break in rhythmic harmony,
a pulse that echoes time's embrace.

Footprints trace stories in the sand,
washed away but never forgotten.

Listen to the ocean’s whisper,
it cradles the essence of every journey.

- Kate Bush
