Harmony

In dusk’s soft glow, the world stands still,
The harmony of life, a sacred thrill.
The birdsong mingles with the breeze,
As evening drapes her gentle freeze.

Each star emerges in velvet night,
A symphony of celestial light.
And in this tranquil, hallowed space,
We find our peace, our rightful place.

So let the world spin fast and wide,
In nature’s arms, we’ll gently glide.
Through every breath, a song unfolds,
In whispered truths, the heart beholds.
