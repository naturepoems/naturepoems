The forest-boughs are grey  
         And the air is sweet and still,  
         The broken branches sway  
         As if to loose the thrill,  
         As if to calm the callâ€”  
         O what would winter bring?  
         It is but borrowed strength; it shall  
         Go out again in spring!

- Robert Browning
