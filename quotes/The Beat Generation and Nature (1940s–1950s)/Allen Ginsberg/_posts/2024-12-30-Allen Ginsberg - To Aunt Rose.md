To Aunt Rose

You’re such a many-faceted being,
    with thoughts strung out beneath
the daylight sky,
You wander free among the kitchens
and hedge rows, wild and loose with existence,
I see you with baby’s breath in hand,
        celebrating love,
As if every evening were made for you,
And the lives around you,
    dancing in time with the stars above,
