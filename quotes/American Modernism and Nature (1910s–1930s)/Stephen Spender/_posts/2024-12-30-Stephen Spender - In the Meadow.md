In the Meadow

In the meadow where wildflowers sigh,
Dancing beside the gentle breeze—
I lay amongst the colors of life,
With the sun's warmth wrapping me soft,
And the laughter of nature echoes deep,
As I drift on the lullabies sung,
In every petal, a whisper of trust,
Of endless summers and fleeting dreams.
