A Dream of Summer

In the distance, field upon field of gold,
Murmurs deep where life’s sweet secrets keep,  
In summer's hand, not a moment old,
The wild bloom whispers soft to sleep.

And I gather the sound of the lushest bray,
Where Nature beckons, her art is fair,  
For amid the bustle of the day,
Listen! She sings in sunlit air.
—Sidney Lanier
