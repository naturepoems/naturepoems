Through the clifftops and valleys, the wildflowers spread,
Painting the earth where the sunlight has led.
The colors together form a brilliant parade,
In praises of seasons, a tapestry laid.

From the hum of bees buzzing in wild summer heat,
To the crunch of leaves ‘neath the autumn’s retreat,
Each note of existence, with life intertwined,
Is a song of the natural, a vision designed.


- Willa Cather
