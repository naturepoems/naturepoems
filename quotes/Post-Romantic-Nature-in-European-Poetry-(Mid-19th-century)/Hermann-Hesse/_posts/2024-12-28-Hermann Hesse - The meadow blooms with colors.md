The meadow blooms with colors bright,
A canvas wrought by nature’s hand,
Each flower sways in breezes light,
A joyous hymn across the land.

With every petal, dance of grace,
The beauty found in fleeting hours,
In simple things, the wildest trace,
Of love, of life, in nature’s flowers.

- Hermann Hesse
