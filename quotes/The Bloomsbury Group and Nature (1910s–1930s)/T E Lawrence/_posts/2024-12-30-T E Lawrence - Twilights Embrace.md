The sun sets below the ridge,
   And the shadows come to play,
   Earth takes a breath so deep,
   As day makes its gentle exit.
   
   The trees whisper ancient tales,
   Leaves dance with the touch of a breeze,
   Nature’s melodies echo softly,
   Carried by twilight's ease.
   
   In the silence, life begins to huddle,
   Stars twinkle in a distant gray,
   The moon, like a soft acceptance,
   Guides the night on its way.

- T E Lawrence
