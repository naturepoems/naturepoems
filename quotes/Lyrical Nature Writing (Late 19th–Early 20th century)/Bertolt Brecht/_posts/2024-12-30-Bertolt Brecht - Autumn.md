Autumn

Come, feel the chill,
the caress of fading warmth,
for the leaves begin their song.
They dance in the wind,
a swirling tapestry,
yellow, red, gold,
each a farewell,
each a sigh.

How they twirl,
how they spin,
a waltz performed
under the watchful eye
of the harvest moon.
Let us gather their echo,
and savor their colors,
as we, too,
slow our steps,
await the winter’s embrace.

In this fleeting moment,
we are reminded
that life is a cycle,
a beautiful succession,
forever interwoven
with the fabric of nature.

- Bertolt Brecht
