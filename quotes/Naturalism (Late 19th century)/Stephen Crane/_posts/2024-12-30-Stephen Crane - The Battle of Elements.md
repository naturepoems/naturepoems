The sun is a vengeful god;  
It creates and destroys  
With fire and steel.  
But the gentle rain  
Falls half-heartedly,  
As if it regrets the fervor  
Of yesterdayâ€™s heat.  
A battle between light and dark,  
Where whispers of peace fade  
Into the cacophony,  
And storms rise to shatter  
The tranquillity.

- Stephen Crane
