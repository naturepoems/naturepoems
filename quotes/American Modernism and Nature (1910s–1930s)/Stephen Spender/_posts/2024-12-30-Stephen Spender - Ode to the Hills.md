Ode to the Hills

O hills, that rise like olden gods,
With your veils of green and gold,
You cradle the stories of the winds,
From the whispers of dawn to twilight spells—
How often I seek shelter in your arms
From the rush of city thoughts and dreams;
In your presence, the world melts away,
Leaving only echoes of eternity.
