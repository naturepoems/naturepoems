Summer
And when the day is summer bright,
Where waters burst, and flowers grow,
Each part doth weave a glossy sight,
And fields in luscious green aflame.
\nBut amid this light, alas! I dream,
Nor hear the lark take swift flight,
With each thought as sharpest beam
That holds a glance to every height.
\nYet shall I greet these births which grow,
And lie beneath this sun so real,
Among the laughing lilies’ show
Till past all pleasure’s dizzy feel.

- George Meredith
