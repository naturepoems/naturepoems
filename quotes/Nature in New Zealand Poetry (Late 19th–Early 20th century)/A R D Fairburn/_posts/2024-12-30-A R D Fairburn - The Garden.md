The Garden

The flowers bloom in wild array,
Colors burst from greenest leaves,
And in the heart of nature’s play,
A hymn of life the beauty weaves.

Each petal tells a secret prayer,
Each fragrance whispers love anew,
In my small garden, peace I share,
The earth’s embrace, both kind and true.


- A R D Fairburn
