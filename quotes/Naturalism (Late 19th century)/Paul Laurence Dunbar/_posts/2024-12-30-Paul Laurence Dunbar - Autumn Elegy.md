When autumn paints with fiery hues,  
The leaves extend their last adieu.  
The crisp, cool air, so fresh and bright,  
Announces change as day turns night.  

Each russet tone and gold so warm,  
Is natureâ€™s dress, a quiet charm.  
As seasons weave their endless thread,  
In harmony, all life is bred.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
