The river winds, a silver thread,
Through vale and hill, where dreams are bred.
It babbles tales of ancient lore,
Of timeless journeys, evermore.

Beneath its surface, shadows play,
While fish beneath in silence sway,
And on the banks, the flowers bloom,
Their colors bursting, sweeping gloom.


- Roger Fry
