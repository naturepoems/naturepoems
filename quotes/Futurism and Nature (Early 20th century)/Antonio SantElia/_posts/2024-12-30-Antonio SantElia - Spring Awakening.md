Spring Awakening
Awake! The earth begins to bloom,
In colors bright, dispelling gloom.
Nature stretches, yawns and smiles,
Inviting life across the miles.

Cherry blossoms, tender, fair,
Fragrant petals fill the air,
Springâ€™s sweet promise, fresh and new,
In every heart, a feeling true.


- Antonio SantElia
