When winter’s chill has cast its spell,
And wrapped the world in icy lace,
Within the hearth, the stories tell,
Of warmth and light, a soft embrace.

The snowflakes fall like whispered dreams,
And nature sleeps beneath her quilt;
Yet in the silence, hope redeems,
The promise of the springtime built.

So let us cherish every breath,
As seasons shift with gentle grace;
For in each moment, life from death,
Revives the heart in nature's space.

- Hannah More
