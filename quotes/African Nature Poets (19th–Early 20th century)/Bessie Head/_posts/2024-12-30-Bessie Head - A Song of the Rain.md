A SONG OF THE RAIN 
O rain, sweet rain,  
Slippery on the earth,  
You bring life;  
The plants bend and greet you,  
Flowers bloom in rapture.  

You drip from the trees,  
And the air feels fresh,  
You wash the sorrows,  
And paint the paths again,  
In a dance of joy.  

What will you leave behind?  
The glistening leaves,  
And bright pools of laughter,  
In the heart of the village,  
Remembered each year.  


- Bessie Head
