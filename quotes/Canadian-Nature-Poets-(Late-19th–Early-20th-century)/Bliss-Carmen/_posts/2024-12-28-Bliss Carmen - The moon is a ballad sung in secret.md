The moon is a ballad sung in secret,  
The stars are whispers from the dawn,  
And all the wind that blows among the trees  
Is but a voice that calls again, 'Move on.'  
The mountains rise like elders of the night,  
The valleys stretch like dreams out to the day;  
And life, a symphony of dark and light,  
Is played in beauty, ever on its way.

- Bliss Carmen
