quote: "In the twilight of the evening,
A soft sigh rises over the lake,
Where the shadows stretch and cling,
Rendering the silence more profound,
Each ripple a part of the dusk’s embrace.

In the twilight of the evening,
A soft sigh rises over the lake,
Where the shadows stretch and cling,
Rendering the silence more profound,
Each ripple a part of the dusk’s embrace.
