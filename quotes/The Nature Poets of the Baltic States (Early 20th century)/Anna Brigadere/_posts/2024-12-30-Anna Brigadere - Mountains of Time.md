From the shadows of dusk, the mountains rise,
Guardians of secrets, proud and tall.
With clouds for their crowns, they canvas the skies,
Natureâ€™s own sentinels watching all.

The echo of ages in silence resounds,
Embedded in rock, their stories remain.
In every crevice, the past can be found,
Enduring like memories, timeless and plain.

- Anna Brigadere
