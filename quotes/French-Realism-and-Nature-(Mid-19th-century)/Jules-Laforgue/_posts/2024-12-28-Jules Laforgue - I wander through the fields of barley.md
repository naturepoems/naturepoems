I wander through the fields of barley,  
Where the sun spills gold in every corner,  
Each blade a testament to time,  
Rustling with stories unheard.  
In the distance, mountains embrace the horizon,  
Cradling the sky like a child in its dreams,  
I bend down to listen to the earthâ€™s heartbeat,  
In the silence, a symphony resides,  
And I, amidst the beauty, blend with the breeze.

- Jules Laforgue
