The Garden

Here in the garden where life seems
A secret of the marigold streams;
With every bloom and fragrant air,
Nature whispers softest care.

In joys of green where shadows lie,
The petals dance beneath the sky;
For in this world of loveâ€™s embrace,
We find our yearning heart's true place.

- Edward Thomas
