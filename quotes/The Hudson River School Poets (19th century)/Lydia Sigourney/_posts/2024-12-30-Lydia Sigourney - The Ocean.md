The Ocean

Oh, mighty ocean, deep and wide,  
Your waves have tales of time,  
In rhythmic roll, the world’s great tide,  
A symphony sublime.

Through storms and calms, you sing your song,  
With beauty’s every breath;  
In your embrace, where we belong,  
You hold the pulse of death.

Yet in your depths, vast mysteries lie,  
The wonders of the deep;  
In every wave, a lullaby,  
In every tide, dreams sleep.

- Lydia Sigourney
