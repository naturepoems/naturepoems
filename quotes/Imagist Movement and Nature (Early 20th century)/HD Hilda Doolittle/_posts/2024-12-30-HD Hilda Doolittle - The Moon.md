The Moon

The moon
    is a lady,
    the moon
    is a silent bird,
    swimming up
        to a light unseen.
In the moonlight,
    there is a white veil
    (in the wild lilacs,
    there are petals)
while outside waits
the hard thunder,
    and the stars!

The clear bed,
    laced and powdered
    by lilies.
Let nature bloom
and fill hot bodies,
    to pluck flowers
and hear the dark cry of love.

- HD Hilda Doolittle
