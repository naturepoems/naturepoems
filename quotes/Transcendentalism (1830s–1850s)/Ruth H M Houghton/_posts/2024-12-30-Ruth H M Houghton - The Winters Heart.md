The Winter's Heart
When snowflakes fall like whispered dreams,
The world is hushed, in silver beams,
A blanket soft, a peaceful sight,
In winter's arms, the heart takes flight.

Each flake a promise, pure and bright,
In the quiet, there's a light,
For in the cold, we learn to see,
The warmth of love—just you and me.


- Ruth H M Houghton
