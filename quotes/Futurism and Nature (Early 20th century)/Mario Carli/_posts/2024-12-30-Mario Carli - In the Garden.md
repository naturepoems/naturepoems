In the Garden
Amidst the blooms,
Whispers of fragrance,
Color spills like laughter,
A garden's embrace,
Where petals unfurl,
In sunlit splendor,
And bees hum their tunes,
Gathering sweetness,
Here nature thrives,
In every vibrant shade,
A tapestry woven with care,
Where growth and decay,
Dance a delicate waltz,
Life begets life,
In the heart of the garden,
A sanctuary of peace,
And flourishing beauty.


- Mario Carli
