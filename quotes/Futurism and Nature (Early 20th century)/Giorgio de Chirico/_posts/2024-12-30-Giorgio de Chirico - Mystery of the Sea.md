Seas of shifting color beneath,
The horizon teases the mind’s eye,
As waves beckon with a rhythmic call,
Drawing us into their celestial dance.

The shores greet the day with open arms,
Rocks stand as guardians of time’s flow,
Feeling the pulse of the restless sea,
And the heart's innate urge to roam.

Yet in the foam of emerald waters,
Lurks the mystery of ages past,
Where stories linger beneath the surface,
Cradled in the caverns of the deep.

- Giorgio de Chirico
