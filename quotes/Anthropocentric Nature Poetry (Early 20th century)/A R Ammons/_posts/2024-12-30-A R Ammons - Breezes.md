Breezes

Breezes entwine along the ocean,
  playing with moments, expanding,
  unfolding sights of salt; 
they spill like laughter,
  curled up and twisting â€”
  a dance of the tides;
the sea shimmers,
  while sudden glimpses alert
  the ground beyond.
O, to walk here
  with you, along the edges,
tracing the textures,
  things strong, yet soft,
that could easily be missed
  along this road; it is alive.

Every step is a wonder.
Every sound a delight.

- A R Ammons
