Morning Poem

Every morning
I can see it is a good day.
The gardens, the trees,
the bright creeks,
the soft moon,
the low clouds,
all sprout up fresh again,
spun anew.
I take note of every new thing that grows,
every sound that comes back to my ears,
every rush of the water
and the wildflower.
The sun has come and said,
"Let there be light!" and there is,
and it is good.
But I can’t help but see
yesterday’s struggle,
yesterday’s battles.
I see it swirling around the sparkle of today.
Oh, my friends, hold on tight,
stand firm and know
you will feel the solace
that comes from each new day.

- Mary Oliver
