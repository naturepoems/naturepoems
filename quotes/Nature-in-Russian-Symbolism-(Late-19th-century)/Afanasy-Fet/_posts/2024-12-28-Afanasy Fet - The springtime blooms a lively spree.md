The springtime blooms, a lively spree,  
As colors burst from nature’s hand,  
Each petal sings of harmony,  
In fragrant fields, I joyfully stand.  

Where birds rejoice with tunes so bright,  
And life awakens all around,  
In blossomed love, I take my flight,  
In nature’s arms, my heart is found.
