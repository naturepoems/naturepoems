On a quiet evening
I walked along the hedgerow;
The breeze beckoned to the leaves,
Just as a mother calls her child.
Softly, gently, all rustling and
Unseen, there was a lengthy twilight:
And the stars winked, a little like hope,
And the moon chuckled,
At wild dreams born upon the damp earth.

— **Virginia Woolf, Evening in the Garden**
