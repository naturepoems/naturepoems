Nature's Embrace  
In every brook that tumbles near,  
In every rustle, soft and clear;  
Nature whispers, sweet and low,  
Embracing us in ebb and flow.  

The mountains rise, a steadfast grace,  
While valleys hold their warm embrace;  
In points of light where fireflies play,  
Life dances on through night and day.  

So let us find this gentle ease,  
In nature’s arms, our hearts appeased;  
For in her hold, we find our space,  
A wild and wondrous, sacred place.

- A R D Aelred Lee
