The Marshes of Glynn
By Sidney Lanier

Gleam of the moon, and a dream of the sea!
    And my heart is a stream that is flowing from me.

I feel the curve of the world as I gaze,
    I seem to be part of the wave that I praise;
The lonelier it feels, the more it feels true,
    And my heart is a stream that is flowing anew.

An evening in June! a stillness and calm!
    The breath of the breezes has passed like a psalm.

The woods are all bending, and bending their halls,
    And love is a whisper that echoes in walls.

The lilies are shimmering, the mosses are pale,
    The stars are all plunging, descending like hail;

In the twilight and shadows, the night has begun,
    On the marshes of Glynn, beneath the soft sun.











The Symphony
By Sidney Lanier

These are the sounds of the deep:
The great woods sighing return us to sleep;
    The winds and the waters combine,
The woods and the waves are divine.

With my heart, I am feeding on sounds,
    The woods have such vastness, such sweetness of ground;
The stars are the drums in the air,
The peace of a night filled with care.

The waves weave with rhythm and calm,
    And whisper far off some deep psalm;
The high winds are gathering, rising to play,
And calling my heart as they sway.

And I’m lost in the breaths that are free,
A harmony wrapping like sea to the sea.











The Song of the Chattahoochee
By Sidney Lanier

Out of the hills of Habersham,
    Down through the valleys of Piedmont,
I rush on my way 
    Rejoicing and singing, 
    Inviting the climber to measure me, 
    And to build mighty spires from me.

I am a brook, and my course runs clear,
    I carry the joys of both valley and sphere.

Through the hills and the valleys I journey long,
    Rejoicing the mountain with my song;
My heart isies and my body is toil—
    But my soul soars high, as my waters rise.

I meet for my banks the mountain’s embrace,
    And I dance down the canyons with grace.











The Pine
By Sidney Lanier

The lone pine stands against the night
    A pillar of strength, a wondrous sight.
In the tranquil moonlight, it sways and breathes,
    A strength so deep, its faith never leaves.

In silence it whispers, embracing the dark,
    A sentinel of nature, a great whispering lark.
Each needle a note in the chords of the trees,
    Grows out of the silence, a sermon to please.

The winds may cry, the storms may roar,
    But the lone pine stands, a heart evermore.











A Marshland
By Sidney Lanier

I dreamed in a marshland, soft and low,
    Storms passed over, and rivers did flow;
I picked at the reeds, and I gathered their dreams,
    Laughter like water, in delicate streams.

The willows like dancers did bend and play,
    With spirits both curious and whispering sway;
The tides of the nature were singing for me,
    In that soft-sand marshland, so wild and free.

If only we could all feel the way that it feels,
    To dance with the reeds, like a time that heals.











The River
By Sidney Lanier

Flow on, thou shining river,
    With thy golden shores and your silvered curves.
The woods and the skies are the breath of my life,
    The moods of the earth that nurtures my verve.

The voice of the river is ancient and true,
    In its flowing I hear all the longings of blue.
Every ripple is story, each splash is a song,
    As the river runs winding, fulfilling their throng.

So let me be lost in the shade of thy trees,
    And drink deep the moments until I know peace.











A Bluebird Singing
By Sidney Lanier

A bluebird is singing on high, so bright,
    And I look from the vale where the shadows lie.
The air is so tender, with whispers of spring,
    That dance with the song, where the glory does cling.

Each note is a thread that spins deep from my soul,
    Through the trees and the flowers, each moment’s a scroll.
It lifts me beyond what my eyes can recall,
    How sweet is a song that can give life to all.

Let my heart be open, let it start that flinging,
    As deep as a bluebird, and its great singing.











A Sunset Trail
By Sidney Lanier

Upon the distant hills the sunset trails,
    A soft golden mist, where the day prevails.
The world is a canvas, brushed hues in the air,
    The colors, they linger, a festival fair.

The breezes are low, and they dance with the trees,
    Whispers awaken from the quietest of leaves.
Along the ridges, where the evening comes,
    I run with the soft light, a song in my drums.

So let it be known that the day must retreat,
    For each golden hour, is a moment we greet.











The Marshes again
By Sidney Lanier

O marshes of Glynn! I mourn and bow,
    For my soul can feel like the tired day’s plow,
Light dimming softly through hazy croons,
    Like whispers of twilight in time’s gentle tunes.

The tall grass is waving like witnesses dear,
    They nod to the last of the sun’s tender near.

The moon will be rising, slow up from the sea,
    And its light will be shining, a faint memory.
This spirit of nature travels like streams,
    My heart carved in echoes, alive with dreams.
