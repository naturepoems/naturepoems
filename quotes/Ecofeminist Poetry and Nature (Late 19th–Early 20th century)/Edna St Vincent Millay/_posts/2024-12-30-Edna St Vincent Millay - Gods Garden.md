GOD’S GARDEN

The wonders of your garden fair,
   Where laughing children play,
And drift on warmth so full and rare,
   Beneath the sun’s sweet ray.

A loving touch and nurturing hand,
   On leaves of gold and grace,
Make beauty bloom and amber stand,
   Where time begins to pace.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
