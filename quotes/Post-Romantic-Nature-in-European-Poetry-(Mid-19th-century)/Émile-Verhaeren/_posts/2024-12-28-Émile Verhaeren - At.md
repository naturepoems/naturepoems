At Dawn
Ah! the dawn breaks,  
Steeped in the gold of morning,  
And the sky awakes anew  
To the lark’s joyous song,  
With notes that tremble like light,  
And shiver on the hills.

The wind carries whispers,  
And the trees sway in rapture,  
Opening their leaves to embrace  
The sun’s first kisses,  
While the dew still lingers,  
Beneath the sweet embrace of time.

- Émile Verhaeren
