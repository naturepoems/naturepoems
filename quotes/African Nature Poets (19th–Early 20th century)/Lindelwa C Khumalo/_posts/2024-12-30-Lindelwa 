The Call of the Wild
In the rustle of leaves,
And the call of the wild,
Nature's own voice,
Is raw, untamed, and wild.

It beckons the weary,
With a promise so sweet,
To find in the wilderness,
A rhythm, a beat.

So venture outside,
Let your spirit take flight,
For the call of the wild,
Is a song of pure light.

- Lindelwa C Khumalo
