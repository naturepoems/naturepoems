The silence"

quote: "In the depth of the woods,
The silence speaks through trees,
The way a river thrums;
Echoes from hidden places
Where light sifts through branches,
Softly revealing each shadow,
The dance of a flitting moth, a whisper
Of leaves weaving tales of dawn."

In the depth of the woods,
The silence speaks through trees,
The way a river thrums;
Echoes from hidden places
Where light sifts through branches,
Softly revealing each shadow,
The dance of a flitting moth, a whisper
Of leaves weaving tales of dawn.
