The Sun  
   
O blazing sun, with golden rays,  
You send the shadows far away,  
In twilight's hue, as light decays,  
Your warmth, a lover’s soft array.  
  
Within your gaze, the colors bloom,  
From vibrant greens to ocean’s blue,  
In every petal, life consumes,  
A chorus bright, fresh as the dew.  
  
O sun, your passage fills the sky,  
In every dawn, hearts feel the thrill,  
In nature’s love, we rise and fly,  
To dance beneath your wondrous will.

- Herman Melville
