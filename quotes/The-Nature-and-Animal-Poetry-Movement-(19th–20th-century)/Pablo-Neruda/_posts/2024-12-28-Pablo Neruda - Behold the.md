Behold the sunflowers,
as they raise their heads,
a chorus for the dawn,
a testament of light.
Turning their faces
brave to the warmth,
they are eyes of the day,
anchors of delight.
Hold my soul in their yellow,
in the mid-afternoon breeze,
for they dance with the shadows
and hum sweetly of keys,
unlocking the patterns
that allow us to grow;
nature’s gentle secrets,
just outside and aglow.
