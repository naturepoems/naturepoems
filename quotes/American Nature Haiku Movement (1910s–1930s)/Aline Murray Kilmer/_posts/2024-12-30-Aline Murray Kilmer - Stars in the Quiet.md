Stars in the Quiet
Stars in the quiet sky above,  
Scatter wishes fair and bright—  
For hearts that yearn to sing in tune  
With nature’s breath in flight.

There’s beauty found in silent moments,  
In the swirl of dreams unfurled,
When every star becomes a promise,  
And the moonlight hugs the world.
