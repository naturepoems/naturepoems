The Cuckoo

O cuckoo! sing thy welcome song,
With spring upon the verdant land.
Your notes wake life where they belong,
A herald of the blossomed strand.

In woods and meadows rich and bright,
Your voice is joyous, sweet and clear;
Your call echoes through day and night,
A promise of warmth, and laughter near.

- John Clare
