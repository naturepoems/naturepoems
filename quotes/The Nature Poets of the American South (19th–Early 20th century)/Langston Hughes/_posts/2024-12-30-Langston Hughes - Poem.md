Poem
The bright sun sets,
yellow and orange in the sky.
And the quiet shadows creep,
As night falls gently and softly by.

I hear the song of the crickets,
they whisper sweetly through the trees.
And the flowers close their petals,
Waiting for the breezes.

I watch the shimmering stars,
They twinkle with a tender glow.
And I bask in their beauty,
as the moon’s soft light starts to show.

This is my time of dreaming,
When silence fills the air.
Nature’s symphony surrounds me,
And I feel the world is fair.



- Langston Hughes
