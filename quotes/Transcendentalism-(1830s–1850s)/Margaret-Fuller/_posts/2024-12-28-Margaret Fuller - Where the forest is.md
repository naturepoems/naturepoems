Where the forest is deep,
And secrets abound,
Within the great silence,
A wisdom is found.

The branches weave gently,
In shadows that gleam,
Reflecting the shapes
Of the wildest of dreams.

The mushrooms grow quietly,
In coolness they thrive,
Their beauty unnoticed,
Yet sacredly alive.

Oh, dance with the leaves,
Sway soft in the breeze,
For nature has called you,
In her warm embrace, please.
— Margaret Fuller
