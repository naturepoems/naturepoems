The ocean waves, a timeless dance,  
Crash against the shores of fate,  
Each foam-draped surge, a fleeting chance,  
A story told in water's state.
  
In the twilight's soft embrace,  
The horizon blushes, golden bright,  
And in that moment, we find our place  
In nature's ever-flowing light.


- Friedrich Hölderlin
