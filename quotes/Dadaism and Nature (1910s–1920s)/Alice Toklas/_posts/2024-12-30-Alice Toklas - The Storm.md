Clouds gather,
shadows cast,
a whirlwind of thoughts
in the breath of wind,
a shiver of leaves,
responding, reacting
to the stir of the storm.

Thunder rolls,
a raw symphony,
a Dadaist chaos of sound,
as raindrops become drums,
splashing rhythms madly
on rooftops, on sidewalks,
inviting children to dance.

The earth drinks deep,
a parched thirst quenched,
a life renewed,
the soil sighs,
a moment of truth,
a resurgence,
a promise held high.

The world spins,
a carousel of time,
a nature’s theater,
an unfolding mystery.
I am every drop,
every blade of grass,
every storm,
watching the play unfold,
while I surrender
myself to the dance of the universe.

- Alice Toklas
