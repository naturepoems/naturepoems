By the dappled trees of heaven,
The dancing leaves do sing.
The walk upon that bright green floor,
That wildflower meadow brings.

O golden sunset time of day,
Of tender dusks and fair,
The noise of wings I hear so bright
The flow’ of voices rare.

Each branch doth call, a beckoning hand,
Among the breezy morn
A hush, a clamor, calls anew
When creatures sweet not born.

By the tress of jeweled greenery
The songsters shout so proud,
An ode to nature’s simple grace
Is lifted to the crowd.

O fresh-glow bulbs of sunlit grace!
Bestow a smile perceived.
A tapestry of dreams set free,
Summoned by all, believed.


- James Joyce
