A Pact
I make a pact with you,
             Walt Whitman—
I pick up the green tug of the earth
    I love you—
        I love you—
For the loss of the American ocean,
             For the loss of the eternal tide,
             For the loss of the green earth.
For the loss of grass, a bird,
    Industrials, steel and copper
For the loss of living wood,
                For you, I love you—
For the spin of the world—
    And the song of the pines.

- Ezra Pound
