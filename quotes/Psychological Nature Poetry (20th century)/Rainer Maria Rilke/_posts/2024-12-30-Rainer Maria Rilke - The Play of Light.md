The Play of Light

Every morning invites us anew,
To rise and feel the sun, 
And the morning-glories bloom, 
Their petals opening like the day emerged,
With each breath drawn in sync, 
With the chorus of gathering spheres, 
And the verdant canvas unfolds,
Colors painting over time, 
In a serene dance where the sky meets earth.

Light holds the whispers of the past,
And the soft winds invite perspective,
Shapes, colors, textures give depth to our seeing,
As the water ripples, with sunlight coaxing,
And everywhere no matter where you turnâ€”
Life invites you to look deeper,
Beneath the surface of this play of light, 
And feel your spirit light with joy.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
