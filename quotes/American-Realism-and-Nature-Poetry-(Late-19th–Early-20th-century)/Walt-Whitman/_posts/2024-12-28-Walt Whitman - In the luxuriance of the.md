In the luxuriance of the woods,
  In the solitude of the field,
  I feel nature’s sway over me,
She breathes through all things:
  She sings through the meadows,
  She dances through the streams.  

I am one with her and in her,
  The sun is mirrored in my heart.
  The winds embrace me in their soft whispers
They carry my soul upwards, to the sky.  


- Walt Whitman
