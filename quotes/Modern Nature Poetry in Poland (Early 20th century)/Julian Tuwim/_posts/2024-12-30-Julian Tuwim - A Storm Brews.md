A storm brews over the hills,
Shadows stretch with growling glee,
The trees bend with nature’s will,
As wind kisses the restless sea.
Lightning strikes, a swift spark,
Illuminating darkened skies,
And in the midst of chaos,
Life’s heart continues to rise.

Nature's wrath, a fierce tempest,
But after comes the calm—
A rainbow arches in the sky,
Bringing the world back to charm.

After dark clouds have dispersed,
Life begins another day,
Nature’s cycle eternal,
In this beautiful ballet.

- Julian Tuwim
