The Keeper of the Great Desert

Where the desert sun sprawls wide, and the sands soar high,
In the heat, romance murmurs on the desert sigh,
I seek a keeper of the wild and free,
Who holds the secret of natureâ€™s harmony.

In the heart of the wilderness, the keeper unfolds,
With hands engraved in lines of truth, stories told,
Whispers of courage, and of love in flight,
In the shadow of the ancient hills of light.

As the winds caress the strands of gold,
And the souls of nature in each heart behold,
The keeper weaves through fields of dust,
Holding the past in the bond of trust.

So come forth where the wild things roam,
In the arms of the land where we make our home,
Through pathways of dreams, and the spirit divine,
We shall find the way, in the great desert mine!

- Banjo Paterson
