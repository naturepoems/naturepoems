To a Poor Old Woman
munching a piece
of Mary’s

muffin
which she
keeps remembering
in her

merry brow
upon a rough
cobble

that she has
grown used to
since food
grew so scarce

but the coffee was
wonderful, hot

and all gone –
and her last
muffin orb
munching with
an exhausted
sigh now


- William Carlos Williams
