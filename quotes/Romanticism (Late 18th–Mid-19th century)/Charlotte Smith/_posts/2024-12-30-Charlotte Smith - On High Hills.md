On lofty hills I stand, with breath held fast,  
And drink the cool, refreshing air of morn;  
While from afar, the mighty billows cast,  
Their sparkling spray upon the ocean worn.  

O Nature’s beauty, in thee do I dwell,  
Thy wild, untamed spirit fills my weary soul;  
In every sigh, in every whisper, tell  
Of love eternal, under heaven's stroll.

- Charlotte Smith
