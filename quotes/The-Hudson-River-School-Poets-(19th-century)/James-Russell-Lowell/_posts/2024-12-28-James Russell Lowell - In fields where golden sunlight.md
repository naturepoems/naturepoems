In fields where golden sunlight plays,
And echoes of the flocks do roam,
There, gentle whispers breathe your praise,
And weave the wild flowers for a home.

The river laughs, the brook runs free,
With crystal lines, it sings along;
The whispering winds, caress the tree,
In joy of nature’s glorious song.

O, hold me close to Nature's breast,
In every glade, on every hill;
In her own arms, I’ll find my rest,
In love, forever, I am still.

- James Russell Lowell
