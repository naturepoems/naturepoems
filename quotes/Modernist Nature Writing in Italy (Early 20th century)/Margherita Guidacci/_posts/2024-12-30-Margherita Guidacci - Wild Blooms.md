Among the brambles,
where thorns protect their treasure,
the wild blooms flourish,
fierce in their defiance,
a riot of life in chaos.

Here, under natureâ€™s ferocity,
a beauty unfolds,
a lesson whispered in the wind:
strength lies in vulnerability,
where even the tangled roots
can reach the sky.

- Margherita Guidacci
