Ribblesdale

So whatever in beauty fair,
  Hear, hear it, splashing me, now the sky must be done;
  We laugh aloft, with a joyful tear!
  We travel on summer belt and sun.

The calmly stole lifelessness flowers,
  Create in sight without hands, sea-spirits find!  
  The wild tomorrows upon silvery towers,
  Be they rejoice with the river kind!


- Gerard Manley Hopkins
