The storm clouds gather, a symphony loud,
As the wind howls fiercely, nature’s own roar;
The sea crashes waves, a wild serenade,
In this tumultuous life, I crave for no more.

For in the chaos, I find a deep peace,
An understanding of life in its unrefined state;
When the storm finally passes, I stand in the light,
Grateful for wonders that nature creates.

- Sigbjørn Obstfelder
