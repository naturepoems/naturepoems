Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction

I
It must be abstract.
It must change.
It must give pleasure.

II
The most beautiful thing
In the world is the world.
How beautiful, how wonderful...
The past is a bright tree.

III
Nature is a thought.
Nature is what remains of places
After people are no more.

IV
A poem is the voice of the heart,
The heart; alone alone; the very
earth is the earth and it leads you.

V
The poem is a friend,
With nobility in its cadence,
It has the grandeur of the land.
                                 


- Wallace Stevens
