Snow in the Suburbs
  
  The house is quiet, the air is still,  
  A white blanket covers the earth,  
  A shimmer of beauty over the dull,  
  The trees stand dressed, a bridal birth.  
    
  Time stands still; everything is hushed,  
  The world transformed in powder snow,  
  There's magic in the way it's brushed,  
  Peace flows gently, a serene glow.

- Louis MacNeice
