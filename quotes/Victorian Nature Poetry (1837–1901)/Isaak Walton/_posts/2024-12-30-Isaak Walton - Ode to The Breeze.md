Oh gentle breeze that stirs the leaves,
  A lover’s touch upon the ground,
  You carry secrets far and wide,
  With every sigh and rustling sound.

The birds will sing and insects hum,
  The sun will cast a golden hue,
  In every moment, life will come,
  To greet the morning fresh and new.

- Isaak Walton
