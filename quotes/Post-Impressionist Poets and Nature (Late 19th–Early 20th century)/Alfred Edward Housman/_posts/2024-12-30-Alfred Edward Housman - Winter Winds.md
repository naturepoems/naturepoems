When winter winds begin to blow,
And snowflakes dance like whispers low,
I’ll walk alone, through forest bare,
With nature’s grace in fragrant air.

Each icy breath will paint the ground,
And silence here is joy profound,
For in this stillness, hearts can find,
A longing held, a love entwined.


- Alfred Edward Housman
