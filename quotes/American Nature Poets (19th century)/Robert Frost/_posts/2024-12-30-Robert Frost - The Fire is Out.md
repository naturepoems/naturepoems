The fire is out; the ghost of the flame,
That flickered bright through the listless night,
Now rests in silence; the wood remains,
Silenced by ash, shamed into the reign.

Rain will fall to wash the sorrow,
But in the dark, a new sun will rise,
And the woods will spring to life tomorrow,
Filled with the laughter of whispers and sighs.

And if you stay till the dawn breaks,
With me, youâ€™ll see the world anew,
Our hearts will sing alongside the lake,
Filling the woods with hues of the true.

- Robert Frost
