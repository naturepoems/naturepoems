quote: "The owl serenades the moonlit glade, 
Its song a haunting echo of the night, 
Nature’s whispered secrets, sharp and pale, 
Awakening the dreams of slumbering leaves,
Beneath the stars that scatter like lost thoughts."

The owl serenades the moonlit glade, 
Its song a haunting echo of the night, 
Nature’s whispered secrets, sharp and pale, 
Awakening the dreams of slumbering leaves,
Beneath the stars that scatter like lost thoughts.

- Wallace Stevens
