I stepped within the shadows and kneeled on moss,
Where the blossoming rose would linger; the thunder,
It sounded from peaks; I lay, and trembled,
But found rocks etched golden beneath my head, an echo
Of the north, pierced by the tidesâ€”so loud,
Voices hung forward to grasp the nets from the earth.
