Beneath the vast expanse of sky,
I lose myself in the dance of clouds,
their shapes shifting like dreams,
a reminder of the impermanence of life.

The horizon stretches endlessly,
the promise of a new beginning,
a reminder that even endings
lead to new journeys,
that every sunrise holds magic,
a spark waiting to ignite.

Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
