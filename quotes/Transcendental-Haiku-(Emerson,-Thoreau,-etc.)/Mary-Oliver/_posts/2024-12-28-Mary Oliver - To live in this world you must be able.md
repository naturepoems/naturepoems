author: Mary Oliver
quote: "To live in this world you must be able to do three things: 
To love what is mortal; 
To hold it against your bones knowing 
Your own life depends on it; 
And, when the time comes to let it go, 
To let it go."

To live in this world you must be able to do three things: 
To love what is mortal; 
To hold it against your bones knowing 
Your own life depends on it; 
And, when the time comes to let it go, 
To let it go.

- Mary Oliver
