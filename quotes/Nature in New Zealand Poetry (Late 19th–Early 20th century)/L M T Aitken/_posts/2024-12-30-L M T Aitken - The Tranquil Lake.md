The tranquil lake, with mirrored face,
   Reflects the azure of the skies;
In stillness lies its gentle grace,
   Where swans glide by with fluttered sighs.

The hills embrace it, lush and green,
   With weeping willows bending low;
A tranquil world, serene, unseen,
   A hidden gem where soft winds blow.


- L M T Aitken
