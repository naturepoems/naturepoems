The Blessing of the Road

There’s a blessing on the road
For the weary, worn and old;
For the birds, the trees, the skies,
From which life and love will rise.
And when the storms and rains descend,
It will always remain true,
That the arms of the deep will bend
To take you back once more, anew.

So the steady stars will keep,
Through the night, alight for you
The path where dreams may dance and sweep
And the open hands with love renew.
For there’s a blessing on the road,
Where the spirit of life will soar,
Come unfold beneath the humble load
All the dreams we walk toward the shore.

Just a trail that the heart runs free,
Where the love is pure and kind!
So drop your troubles and come to see
For the world and the heart to find.

- Banjo Paterson
