The Seasons

Through stories, it dances —  
    This flower is alive,  
A perfect crinkle of leaf dust,  
     unmade calamity —  
With each swinging limb unfurling,  
They are heavily alive,  
They are loosely entwined,  
The stories are repeated —  
With sun stretched time-  
To become  
The wishful remembrance —  
Sending us home,  
As shades turned twilight —  
The seasons grow.  

I swear,  
    this earth  
is it,  
A cradle time  
Dressed in child’s balm,  
We endure all here,  
We share,  
    raised to breathe—  
Carry them, feel them —  
A sound born for ages,  
      The patterns abide,  
       on dark days brightly born,  
To reclaim it—  
This life.

- Gwendolyn Brooks
