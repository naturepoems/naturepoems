Where mountains meet valleys,  
In a waltz of the land,  
Nature crafts beauty,  
With an artist’s own hand.

Each stone tells a story,  
Of time’s gentle flow,  
In the echo of wildlife,  
Where shadows may go.

A tapestry woven,  
Of meadows and streams,  
In the heart of the wild,  
I find all my dreams.

- Georgina D Smith
