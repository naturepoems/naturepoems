A Dream of Spring

When spring returns, in blossoms rare,
We’ll trace the quiet pastures fair,
With laughter met at every turn,
Where every flower and leaf shall burn.

Our voices high, on dewy ground,
Shall echo all our favors found,
For Nature's care will lend us sight,
And in her embrace, we’ll take our flight.

- Robert Herrick
