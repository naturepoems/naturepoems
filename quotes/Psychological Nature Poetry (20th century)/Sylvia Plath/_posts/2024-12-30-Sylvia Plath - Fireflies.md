I watch the flicker
    Of fireflies at dusk,
Moving like soft thoughts,
They illuminate the world,
In the gloam,
            Where night meets day,
Ethereal and strange,
          They offer a light,
                     As stars begin.

  The sky unfolds,  
As evening draws near,
Letting a dream take flight,
In the arms of night.

- Sylvia Plath
