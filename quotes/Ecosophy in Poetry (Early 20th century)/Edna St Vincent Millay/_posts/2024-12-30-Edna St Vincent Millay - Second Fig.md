Second Fig  
  -----------  
My candle burns at both ends;  
  It will not last the night;  
But, ah, my foes, and oh, my friendsâ€”  
  It gives a lovely light!  

  The light is soft and pure;  
  It hangs like a flower  
And where it will fall we cannot know  
It will take its chance at the hour.  
  And I shall sit awhile alone,  
Alone, in the light;  
I will see the moistened vine bend down  
  To touch the earth and go out of sight.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
