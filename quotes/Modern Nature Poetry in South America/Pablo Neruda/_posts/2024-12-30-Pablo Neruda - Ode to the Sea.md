The sea, vast and eternal,
opens its embrace to the sky,
where clouds, like white sails,
carry dreams across the waves.
I am a part of this ocean,
a drop in its endless body,
ever changing, yet always new,
where the horizon blurs.

With each tide, I am pulled,
by a force rich and deep,
a rhythm that shapes the shores
and sculpts my silent heart.
I love the sea profoundly,
it teaches the soul to flow,
how to dance with the currents,
above, below, and all around.

- Pablo Neruda
