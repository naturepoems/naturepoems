The Garden

Within these walls, life burgeons,
a sanctuary of growth and decay,
each petal a story,
each weed a reminder,
of the cycles that bind us.

Take a moment, breathe in, the fragrances,
the mingling of earth and bloom,
at the intersection of chaos and design,
as nature curates her art.

Here we cultivate resilience,
a bond to the verdant pulse,
a connection that roots us,
in the tapestry of existence,
a testament, a promise,
of continued wonder, through each seasonâ€™s touch.

- Polia de Montalcini
