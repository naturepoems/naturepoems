The Beast}

They whispered with the clicks of the river,
Its pockets of eddying flower,
Echoing through the bowl of my being.
A tawny slack face appeared in the mist,
In a raving dance of a thousand thorns.
Whipping needles clasping the skin,
I tread softly, quivering in reverie.
And the hives stirred in sweetness
As I haunted this wild, roaring mouth.
He lit a fire across its threshold;
He opened up a body of song
And told tales across the skyâ€™s rolling mass.
Come bubbling shades, and you shone through,
And I let them have their forages,
Clinging, heart pumping wide and free.

- Ted Hughes
