A rainbow after the rain,
a promise renewed,
where color emerges,
a celebration painted across the sky,
a masterpiece crafted by nature.

The drops, like jewels,
dazzle on petals,
and I watch in wonder,
as the world breathes again,
a moment reborn,
a symphony of colors
that speaks to the heart,
a reminder that beauty
can arrive only after sorrow,
that life, much like art,
is an act of resilience.

- Alice Walker
