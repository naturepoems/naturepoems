Flow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes,
Flow gently, I’ll sing thee a song in thy praise;
My Mary’s awake, she’s all ready to sing,
It’s the dawn that I love, and the flowers of spring.

The tired weaver in silence has wove her fine thread;
The cattle have neighed to their owner for feed;
But give me my sweetheart, where e’er I may roam,
In the blushing of roses, we’ll make our way home.

Flow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes,
Flow gently, I’ll sing thee a song in thy praise.
And as long as your waters flow free before me,
I’ll ever remember my love’s face so fair.

- Robert Burns
