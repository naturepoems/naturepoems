The Garden

In fragrant blooms of color bright,  
The garden spreads its pure delight;  
Where every bud holds nature's grace,  
In leafy arms, our worries erase.

With busy bees and humming birds,  
Joy dances here without words;  
In every petal, life resides,  
In nature’s arms, our spirit abides.

- Hartley Coleridge
