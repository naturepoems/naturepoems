The Fish

I caught a tremendous fish
and held him beside the boat
half out of water, with my hook
fast in a corner of his mouth.
He didn’t fight.
He hadn’t fought at all.
He hung a grunting weight,
battered and venerable
and homely.

Here and there
his brown skin hung in strips
like ancient wallpaper,
and its pattern of darker brown
was like a tree bark, and that
was like a monster’s eye.

The fishermen have been careful
of doing anything wrong; 
can I now,
in this moment, do something 
that they never did?

I looked into his eyes
and saw his hunger.
I saw a sentiment
and a resignation
in his insight.

I love to let him go.
I liked his eyes, 
so full of conciliation.
When I let him go,
I got in the water—I went into the water.
I thanked the fish
for reminding me.

I let him go, I did it,
just as you always should—
and he swam
away, a little too heavy,
for his style, maybe—in space.
I let him go—the fish and I.
We shared an articulation.
I saw acceptance in the world,
an attunement I hardly know.
