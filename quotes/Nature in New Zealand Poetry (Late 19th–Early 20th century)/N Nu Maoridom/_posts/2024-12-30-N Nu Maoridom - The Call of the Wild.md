The Call of the Wild

In rugged cliffs where echoes ring,
The wild calls out to soul, a fling,
In nature's roar, I hear my name,
A primal song, untamed, aflame.

With every breeze, I feel her pulse,
In every shadow, mysteries convulse,
To roam the wild, my heart's decree,
In nature's hand, I long to be.

- N Nu Maoridom
