First Fight.
Then Fiddle.

In my wound, I hear a dog howl,
Wind chimes circle—sweet.
The wet rocks, the step stones,
Wish to whisper in night's firm grip.
Chill the bright and burn the wood,
The kittens die on snowed-out ground.
Fashion the billows, gods at play.
Honey to help when the pitcher spills,
Hush your fiery scream today.


- Gwendolyn Brooks
