Seaside Serenity

On the stretch of the shore where the waves meet the sand,
A symphony plays, crafted by nature’s own hand,
With echoes of gulls, and the sun's warm sigh,
The sea whispers secrets, as tides roll by.

Shells scattered like dreams on the shore's gentle breast,
Each one a reminder of moments addressed,
In the dance of the ocean, a rhythm unfolds,
The heart of the deep, its stories retold.

So sit by the water, let worries all flee,
Let the sea’s calming cadence carry you free,
In the embrace of the waves, life’s troubles grow small,
For here in this haven, we transcend it all.
