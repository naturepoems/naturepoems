Where are the songs of spring? Ay, where are they?
Think not of them, thou hast thy music too—
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;

Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
Among the river sallows, borne aloft
Or sinking, as the light wind lives or dies;
And full-grown laments of the swallows

Mourn with voices low, then heard as such unspun,
Heavy-laden forth, their winds will find their own—
Transmute into the musty ground from whence they sprung.
That life can grow from torrents wildly into rut; 

While our breathing sounds, we can only hope to tell
That bells of gold curl upon rose-tiped shores.
*From "To Autumn"*

- John Keats
