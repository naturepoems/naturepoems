The Garden

In the heart of the garden, beneath the sun’s grin,
Inscribed upon the faces of shimmering leaf,
Flow the dreams of the flower in ripeness,
A still echo of days of the heart’s retreat.

Blossoms in colors of the spectrum sit still,
Each with their secrets, they dance in delight.
The whisper of springtime coils through the dreams,
While in the deep roots, something begins to ignite.

Oh marvelous garden that is filled with the quiet,
Every moment beats softly with life’s gentle grace!
In this sanctuary unfolds all the stories,
That the earth’s soft laughter nests in our embrace.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
