Nature is what we see –  
The Hill – the Afternoon –  
Squirrel – Eclipse – the Bumble bee –  
Nay – Nature is Heaven –  

Wildflower on the pioneer –  
A Pilgrim for the bees –  
Liquid rosy dark at dusk –  
Full of sweet reveries –  

The dew is bright as Memory –  
A green and wistful Past –  
And each Immortal Poplar Tree –  
Is lost, but found at last –  


- Emily Dickinson
