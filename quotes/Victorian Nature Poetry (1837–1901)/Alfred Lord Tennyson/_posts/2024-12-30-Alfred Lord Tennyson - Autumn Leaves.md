The flowers that gladdened summer's hours  
Are faded now, and the autumn blows;  
But still the sweetly lingering showers  
Feed the dark earth that the farmer sows.

Though the skies are grey, and the winds are keen,  
And comfort seems to dance afar,  
My heart has found a hidden glean  
Of peace, like a soft and sultry star.

So let the winter's shadow creep,  
For nature's grace will never tire,  
The seeds of joy in silence keep,  
And bloom again with spring's sweet fire.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
