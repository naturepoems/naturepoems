Hark! the sky is gently calling,  
And the warm hues fade from the sea;  
How the sun in his splendors shines  
Illuminating the earth for me.  
In the green glow of the valley deep,  
In the soft whispers of rustling leaves,  
Where the flow of streams does softly seep,  
There’s a magic in nature that weaves.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
