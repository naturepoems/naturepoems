Spring Pools
These pools that, though in forests, still reflect
The total sky almost without defect,
And like the flowers beside them, chill and shiver
Will like the flowers beside them spill their bloom
And their warm sky will suspend a new-born light.

Their light is soft as if to peel the shell
Of darkness opened over a water-nest
And quieted by the light, cool and mellow,
Of clouds in a flower that has just begun to wilt.

These spring pools in the clouds reflect,
Just soft and gentle skies in every lamp,
Mellow in light and blooming in the ground,
Reflecting back the veil they wear—lost daisy,
Sprinkling dreams that scent the air yet unseen—

Where the pink Algonquin softly trails its powder,
Though the trees beside them seem to fetter it, too,
Frozen in equinox, yet alive and warm, yet true,
To the roots this light must find to flourish, too.

I cannot ask how long nor even why,
As flowers must meet the flowers that always tint,
O dream of warming skies in light concealed—
Filling the rim with blooms to bear their hope.

Let them rest, return to spring’s gentle shock—
Let them flow and drink as if they bleed a memory,
Softly shining every twinkling star in dazzling folds,
To put and bring themselves back and feel at ease once more,
Dazeling sky where, come to rest, none can resist.
