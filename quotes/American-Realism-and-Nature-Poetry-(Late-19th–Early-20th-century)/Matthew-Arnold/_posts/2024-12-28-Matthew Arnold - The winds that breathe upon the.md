The winds that breathe upon the hills,
Among the trees and lofty dales,
Sing softly of the peace that fills,
To soothe the heart of love’s old trails.

The winter suns may long repose,
While spring will cast her joys anew,
A vibrant dance where beauty flows,
And shadows hold what lies in view.

So take your hand and walk with me,
Where bird and brook shall greet our tread,
In nature’s time, forever free,
With every voice the heart shall wed.

- Matthew Arnold
