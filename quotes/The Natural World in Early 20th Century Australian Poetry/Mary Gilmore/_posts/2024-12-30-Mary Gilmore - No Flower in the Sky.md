No Flower in the Sky

No flower in the sky but the stars,
  No bloom upon the sea
No trumpets in the breeze,
  But the wild wind brings
The gladness of the worlds to me.

The junto of the sunlit stars
  Bring comfort to my soul;
And from the silent beauty speaks
  The heart's unbroken whole.

For What is natureâ€™s beauty here,
  Not born for happier men
But charged with fate to bring anew,
  The cycles round again.


- Mary Gilmore
