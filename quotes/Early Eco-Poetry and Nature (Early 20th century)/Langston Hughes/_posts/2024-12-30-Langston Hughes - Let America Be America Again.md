Let America Be America Again

Let America be America again.
Let it be the dream it used to be.
Let it be the pioneer on the plain
Seeking a home where he himself is free.

(America never was America to me.)

Let America be the dreamers' dream,
Keep her ideals warm,
Let it be the sun's embrace,
And let liberty's letters shine
Over the pearls of our existence.

Let America be America again.

- Langston Hughes
