quote: "The Great Figure
Among the rain
and lights
I saw the figure 5
in gold
on a black
a fire truck
with the sound
of the siren
as it strode
twenty forward
bearing a mountain
of the sky.

The wheel
rushed past me.

I could hear
it all ringing
in the night."

The Great Figure
Among the rain
and lights
I saw the figure 5
in gold
on a black
a fire truck
with the sound
of the siren
as it strode
twenty forward
bearing a mountain
of the sky.

The wheel
rushed past me.

I could hear
it all ringing
in the night.

- William Carlos Williams
