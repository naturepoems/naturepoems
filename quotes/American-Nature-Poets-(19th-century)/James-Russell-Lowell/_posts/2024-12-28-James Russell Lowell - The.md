The River
The river sings a joyful tune,
Beneath the soft and warming moon,
It flows adown with happy glee,
And calls to every soul to see.

The fishes leap, the reeds bow low,
In peaceful joy, while eagles show,
Their grace against the azure skies,
Where every heart may lift and rise.


- James Russell Lowell
