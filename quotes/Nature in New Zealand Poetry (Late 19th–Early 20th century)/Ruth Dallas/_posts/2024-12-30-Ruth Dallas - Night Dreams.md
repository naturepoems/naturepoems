The stars come out in a velvet sky,  
With the moon a lantern, guiding my heart;  
In this stillness, I quietly sigh,  
As shadows blend with the night’s sweet art.  

The world is hushed, and the dreams take flight,  
In the gentle embrace of the midnight hour;  
Nature whispers softly, "Hold on tight,  
For in dreams, you'll find your power."

- Ruth Dallas
