quote: "The shadows in the glade are gentle,  
A whisper of the evening's breath;  
And on the soft earth, a petal lies,  
A token of the fading light's caress."

The shadows in the glade are gentle,  
A whisper of the evening's breath;  
And on the soft earth, a petal lies,  
A token of the fading light's caress.
