In the Woods

I love to stroll in the woods,  
When twilight drapes her veil of gray,  
And hear the whispered thoughts of leaves,  
And watch the fading light of day.  

The trees stand tall as ancient kings,  
Their branches sway as soft as hair;  
The whispered tales they weave around  
Are secrets borne on autumn air.  

For in their shade, my heart can rest,  
And every care is swept away;  
Each rustling leaf, a soft caress,  
The woods embrace me at the end of day.
