The Lady's Dressing Room

Behold the verdant world adorned,
With flowers laid, their scents so bright,
Each petal a love note that’s born,
To grace the lady’s mirrored light.

With tender hand, do brush the bloom,
As silver vessels catch the glow,
‘Tis nature's wealth, a fragrant room,
And all await each gentle flow.

Let sunlight bend with softened care,
And colors dance upon the leaves,
For every heart knows then to share,
The gifts that earth continually gives.


- Michael Drayton
