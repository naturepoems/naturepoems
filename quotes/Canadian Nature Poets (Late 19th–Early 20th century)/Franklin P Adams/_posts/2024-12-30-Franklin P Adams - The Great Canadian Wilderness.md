The Great Canadian Wilderness

O mighty forests, vast and grim,
Where all the sunlight seems to swim,
And mountains rise with solemn grace,
In your embraces, men find place.

The rivers wind with gentle glee,
Through valleys green, where spirits free
Dance with the breezes, soft and fair,
In Nature’s arms, without a care.


- Franklin P Adams
