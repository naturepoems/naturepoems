Ice and Fire
From that point you could see the earth,
The chill of ice from the sea,
That made the mountains shiver,
And the strength of the trees.

The only answer to warmth
Is the frost of the white fields;
In the cold stillness, nature
Plays her quiet game, like fire.

So warm it becomes,
So cold it remains,
As forms moving slowly through.
And in silence, the eye of man
Is met with the heat of the fire.

To warm the bone scattered on the earth,
And draw it inward toward the light,
Easing fire from ice,
Melting the heart beneath.

- Wallace Stevens
