The Water Lily

A water-lily hid in the pond,
Amongst the reeds and the rushes whose frond
Glistens with dew, 'twas the harbinger bright;
Her white dress expanded inviting delight.

O fair water-lily, so fragrant and pure!
The winds whisper love from your beauty's allure;
Your petals make bright in the starry night,
And the moon bends her brow to your face of white.

Beneath the blue canopy where vapors delight,
Her friendships entwine at the close of the light;
A gem of the waters, a pearl in the breeze,
You float on the ripples that bend with such ease.

The softness enfolds in a fragrant embrace,
Awake to the night in the delicate space,
This spotlight of water, so tender and fair,
In Nature’s own promise, your heart leaves a snare.
