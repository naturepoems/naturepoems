When thoughts of love pursue the soul,
Like roses weaving through the mist,
I find you there, where soft winds stroll,
In nature’s arms, I find my bliss.
The sun dips low, a velvet hue,
Each petal sighs, a lover’s plea.
In gardens where the blossoms grew,
You live forever part of me.
For in each whisper of the trees,
In every shadow cast on stone,
I hear the laughter in the breeze,
And know that love is never alone.


- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
