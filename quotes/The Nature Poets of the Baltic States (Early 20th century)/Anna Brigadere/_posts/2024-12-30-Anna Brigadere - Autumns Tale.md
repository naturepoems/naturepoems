Amidst the autumn leaves, a rustle near,
Nature's palette transforms, vibrant and bold.
With hues of amber and crimson, dear,
A story of change silently unfolds.

Each leaf that falls carries whispers of time,
Reminders of cycles that never cease.
In the dance of decay, a rhythm sublime,
Life's fleeting moments embrace us with peace.

- Anna Brigadere
