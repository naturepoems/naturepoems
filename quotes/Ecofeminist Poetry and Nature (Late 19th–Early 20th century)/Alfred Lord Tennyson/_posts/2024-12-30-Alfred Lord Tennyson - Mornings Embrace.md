When morning breaks with amber light,
The calls of songbirds greet the morn,
And every dew-kissed flower bright,
Wears a new crown, the day reborn.
Awake! arise! let nature's muse
Embrace the warmth of the sun's delight,
With every leaf, new life renews,
In the soft embrace of light.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
