A Song of Triumph
Let your heart dance with the flowers,
And let your spirit rise with the breeze,
For all that lives on Earth’s bright hours,
Combines in one great harmony.
The mountains towering, the rivers flowing,
All wild and free, in unison so,
Make music that only the brave are knowing,
A symphony where nature’s heart beats slow.



- Julian Grenfell
