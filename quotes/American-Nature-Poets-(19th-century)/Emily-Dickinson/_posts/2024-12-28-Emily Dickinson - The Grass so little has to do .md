The Grass so little has to do –  
A Sphere of simple Green –  
Yet hold it up, a Forest –  
As if it were a Queen –  

The Birds and Bees, their Duties –  
But just to flutter by –  
The Grass so grandly sits alone  
And does not say a sigh –  

For Nature's Heart is simple,  
And Mother’s Wildest Wood –  
Is nourished by her Kindness,  
And by her Frugal Mood –  


- Emily Dickinson
