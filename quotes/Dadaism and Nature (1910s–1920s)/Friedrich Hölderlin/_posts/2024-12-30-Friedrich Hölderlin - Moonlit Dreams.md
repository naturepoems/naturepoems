When the moon ascends the velvet night,  
And the stars twinkle like distant dreams,  
Nature cradles our hopes in light,  
Sending whispers through gentle streams.
  
In this sacred, slumbering peace,  
Our souls unite and soar above,  
In nature's grasp, all worries cease,  
And we are one, wrapped in love.


- Friedrich Hölderlin
