A Nature’s Dream

In the hush of evening, as shadows creep,
Where the stars twinkle bright o’er the slumbering deep;
With a heart full of fancy, I wander along,
In a world filled with beauty, where nature’s my song.

The lilies are sleeping, the willows sway low,
In the calm of the twilight, the rivers flow slow;
In dreams of the night, where soft whispers converse,
Oh, the joy of the heart when it finds its true verse.


- John Clare
