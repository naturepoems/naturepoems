There is no one who is in the way
Of making lavender and sweet need
And climbing through the trees,
In a world, in a world,
That has colors and that has
Climbers and climbers that have to be happy.

Some of us are red, some of us are blue,
Some are bright and some are pale,
But all of us have to be happy,
In a little world that we can see through.

- Gertrude Stein
