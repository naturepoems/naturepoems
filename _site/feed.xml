Reflecting the madness of ebb and flow.
In the stillness, chaos finds its muse,
A fusion of worlds, where nothing’s to lose.</p>

<p>Gusts of wind paint stories uncaged,
Ideas unleashed, art now staged.
In every leaf, a tale is spun,
In the wild labyrinth, wisdom won.</p>

Colors collide, a world now broken.
The river runs wild, a stream of dreams,
In fragmented moments, nothing’s as it seems.</p>

<p>A clock ticks loudly in the hush of night,
Challenging the stars, seeking their light.
In tangled roots, life’s laughter lies,
Beauty dances in the chaos that flies.</p>

Stars scatter thoughts, experiences shred.
Time collapses in a cosmic rush,

From chaos arises, life’s grand joke.
Windswept echoes, shadows in play,
Ode to the present, dissolving away.</p>

Dada dreams in the splash of a shoe,

Threaded with dreams, drifting through
Clouds that dance like wild thoughts,

Nature hymns in a whispered dream.
A branch breaks free, a bird takes flight,
In joyous rebellion against the night.</p>
