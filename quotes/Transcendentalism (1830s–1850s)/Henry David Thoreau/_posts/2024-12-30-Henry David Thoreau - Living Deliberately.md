I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,
To front only the essential facts of life,
And see if I could not learn what it had to teach,
And not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.

There, in the atoms of earth and sky,
I encountered the echoes of my soul,
In solitude, truth beckoned nigh,
Nature’s whispers made me whole.

- Henry David Thoreau
