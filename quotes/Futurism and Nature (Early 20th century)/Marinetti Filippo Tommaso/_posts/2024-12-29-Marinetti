The city thunders, echoing the wildness,  
As electric roots tangle with the earth,
Ambitions rise from the dirt and dust,  
While they reach for the infinity that paths expand,
Let blooms erupt among bricks and grime,  
Infusing fragility amidst ironfires,  
As time itself blooms and withers,  
Painting vivid sunsets over concrete.

- Marinetti Filippo Tommaso
