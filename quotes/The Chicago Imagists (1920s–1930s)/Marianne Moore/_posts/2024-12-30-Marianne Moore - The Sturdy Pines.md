The Sturdy Pines
The sturdy pines wave like dark priests
        who whisper softer secrets, claiming something
        lush, gold, on every breadth of air while they live
        with light coiling along tops! 

The graves of texture create fires 
        about the crazy deepness that live within curl
        of trunk and branchness, bending wise—
        like whispers across a purple blur,
        the afterthought flickers throughout woods,
        lending sweetness to the pure thickets that seems
        unsustained under deep warmth of murmured night.

How now the old brothers magpie-spread seem
        tendrils twirling green about blue skies! 
We knew them-crisp words scattered, felt—
        simply worldly within knee tries,
        changed yet sane—teetering wild enough
        which smiles moonlight within trees flare.
—Far let the turn forget all its tender shade.

- Marianne Moore
