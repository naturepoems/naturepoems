As winter wanes and spring draws near,
The earth awakens from its slumber deep,
With vibrant hues and laughter to cheer,
The world is bursting, no more to keep.

The robin sings her sweet refrain,
In the crooked boughs, where blossoms unfold,
Each petal, each leaf, a tale to retain,
Of lifeâ€™s return in its vibrant gold.

Down by the brook where the waters play,
And the sun glistens on the dancing stones,
Nature shares its gifts in the light of day,
In this moment, my heart atones.

I pause beneath the budding trees,
Feeling the pulse of green, the vibrant hue,
In the warmth of spring, my spirit breathes,
And finds its strength in the earth anew.

- Willa Cather
