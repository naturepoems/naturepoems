The Lark Ascending
He rises and spreads his wings,
All nature lifts its breath and hears
The lark, that lingers and sings,
Above the common way of fears.
\nWith such a song, such sounds of hearts,
Fly thou upward, little bird,
No more encumber'd by thy part.
Up, fly, but do not heed a word.
\nBut nature is a thing of pain,
And every heart must too go higher;
With thoughts like his, no song remain,
But I, still free, am but the flyer.

- George Meredith
