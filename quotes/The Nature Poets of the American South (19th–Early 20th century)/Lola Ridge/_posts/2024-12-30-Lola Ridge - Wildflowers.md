Wildflowers

The wildflowers are bedded  
  In the sylvan wood,  
  All the scents  
 
About me, as if willing  
  To fill hearts with service  
  to excuse the act of being;  
 
They spring in such wild grace  
  No one could deny  
  their virtue as splendid  
 
And sweet as a soft sound,  
  The musty air heaves,  
  Reaching near yet far away.
