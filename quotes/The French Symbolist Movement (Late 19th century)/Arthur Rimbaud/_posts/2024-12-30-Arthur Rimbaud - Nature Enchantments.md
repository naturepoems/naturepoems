I

The clear sky, blue as an eye;
The sun shines bright on the golden earth;
A breeze whispers through the trees;
And the river sings a song of peace.

In this perfect moment,
All is alive and vibrant,
A feeling of freedom and joy,
In nature's divine melody.

II

The rose unfolds under the sun,
A blush of crimson and gold;
Petals soft, a balm for the soul,
Transcending the mundane world.

The scent of earth, wet with rain,
Brings forth the essence of life;
In the midst of nature's embrace,
A symphony of colors and sound.

III

Silence falls on the quiet woods;
Mist dances upon the morning dew;
Leaves rustle like whispers,
As a stag passes with grace.

The eternal cycle of life;
From seed to bloom, to dust,
Each moment captured in stillness,
Nature breathes, a timeless gift.

- Arthur Rimbaud
