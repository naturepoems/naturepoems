A tranquil stream that winds so slow,
Reflects the flowers' vibrant glow,
With gentle ripples, tales they tell,
Of hidden magic, of natureâ€™s spell.

From mountains high to valleys low,
The earth's embrace, a sacred flow,
With each new season, life reborn,
In nature's heart, we find the dawn.

- Anna Brigadere
