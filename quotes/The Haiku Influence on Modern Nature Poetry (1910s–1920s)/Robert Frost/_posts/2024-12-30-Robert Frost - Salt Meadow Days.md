By the roadside the salt meadow stands,
Two white rains have been pouring there
And sweet sounds of rest were heard upon the croqueting lands.
There a light breeze skirts along the - 

The lovely morning mist which held, behold,
Returning now to see the tide that now blows here,
In silence gliding across the most soft grass fields,
With a gentle vision wandering near.

The cradle lay cradled in sudden sun,
Around the corner sipped the air until I tasted red:
As I called surreal reflections resting high along the fields,
To bring about the dream in its tiny way foreseen.

- Robert Frost
