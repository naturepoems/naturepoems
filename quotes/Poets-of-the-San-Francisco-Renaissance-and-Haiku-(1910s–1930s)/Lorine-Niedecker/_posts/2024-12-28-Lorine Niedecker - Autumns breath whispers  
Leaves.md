quote: "Autumn's breath whispers,  
Leaves rustling like laughter  
In the crisp air.  
Glistening dew drops  
Swirl like tiny stars,  
Nature's hidden gems  
Underfoot."

Autumn's breath whispers,  
Leaves rustling like laughter  
In the crisp air.  
Glistening dew drops  
Swirl like tiny stars,  
Nature's hidden gems  
Underfoot.
