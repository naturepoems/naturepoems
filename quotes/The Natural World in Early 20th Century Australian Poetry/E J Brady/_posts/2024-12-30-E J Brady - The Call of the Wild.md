The Call of the Wild

In the heart of the wilderness, wild and free,  
A symphony of nature calls to me;  
The rustling leaves, the soft, whispered wind,  
In this sacred space, our spirits are pinned.  

The hunt of the eagle, the dash of the deer,  
In the dance of the wild, we find our cheer;  
With every heartbeat, every breath, every sight,  
We are woven together in the tapestry of life.  

So let us roam through forest and glen,  
Where natureâ€™s spirit brings us again;  
From the depths of the earth to the star-filled above,  
We revel in her beauty, embrace her love.

- E J Brady
