A Patch of Old Snow
There's a patch of old snow in a corner
That I should have guessed
Was a blow-away paper the storm
Had brought from the west's
Flat and smooth, like a sheet of paper,
With no eye to see it,
Except for one, more pile of snow,
That won't pass itself by
As it swells and throws off its silk
Underneath a sun in the blue sky.
Turns into rain as it does so,
Melting into soft drops of bliss,
So sad it grooves into a mass—
Come to see it all again.
However, the joy takes over
Turn to the new field, with dreams,
And the memory is tossed away.

And have come to start anew,
Things to be seen!

But still holds me through.

Let us move ahead, dear friend.

- Robert Frost
