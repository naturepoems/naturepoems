By the tranquil seaward shore, I reflect this day,
There where the thyme and clover meet at last,
In canvassed dreams—an evening unwind way—
So dusk flows fast, brushes of shadows cast.

Yet thoughts arise, as should the earth strive still.
O gentle hand—to break me as a sound,
I see the future beam across thy hill,
And listen deep, in silence from these ground.


- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
