Life's River
Along the banks where wildflowers grow,
A river winds, with gentle flow,
It tells a tale, both old and wise,
Of journeys taken, beneath vast skies.

In every current, a story beams,
Of hopes and dreams, of love and streams,
Through nature’s hand, it carves and bends,
A testament that life transcends.


- Ruth H M Houghton
