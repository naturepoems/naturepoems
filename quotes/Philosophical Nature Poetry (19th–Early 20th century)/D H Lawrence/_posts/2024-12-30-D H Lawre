The Mountain

There in the heights it rises,
Above the valleys, clear and still,
A mountain, ancient and sacred with silence,
Where the fox and the wildflower thrill.

It breathes in the wind's soft sigh,
Beneath the stars, a quiet sigh,
A keeper of secrets, time untold,
Holding the stories of ages old.
D. H. Lawrence
