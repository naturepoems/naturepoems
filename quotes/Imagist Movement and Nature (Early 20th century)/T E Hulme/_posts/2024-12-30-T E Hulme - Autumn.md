Autumn

Is it a crooked tree
That troubles the ground,  
Or is it a big hatch-moth
That flaps on the roof?  
I look at the broken branches  
And the bare roots
And the green turns brown,  
Like all that is shaken,  
And faded away;
And as I step,  
Little bits of bark fall,
And I walk over sod,
And the leaves can be 
When you crumple them.

I feel their silence,
Like death in the wind,  
And the rustling green  
Is a whisper of life
As I droop and bend down
In the darkened air.

- T E Hulme
