A Dream

Once a dream dreamed,  
On a moonlit night,  
With the willow weeping,  
In shadows so slight.  

The stars sang softly,  
In melodies rare,  
While the gentle breeze whispered,  
Through the fragrant air.  

Let me dance in the meadow,  
Where the wildflowers bloom,  
And with natureâ€™s soft cadence,  
Chase away every gloom.  

The beauty of the moment unveils,  
A world so divine,  
Where sorrow never prevails,  
And love and joy intertwine.

- William Blake
