There are Roughs in the Woods

There are roughs in the woods which are abiding,
All the spirits who linger by the river,
And I am one of them, yet I am partially
Drawn along to find the rest of them;
I carry all the leaves of summer and autumn.

In the twisted trails and the careless woods,
That do not all need care, I often still find
The old bright branches bending down in flight,
And take my thoughtfulness where morning flows,
In the glimmer of a summer a day lost â€”
A beauty yet unseen, waiting to be born.

- Robert Frost
