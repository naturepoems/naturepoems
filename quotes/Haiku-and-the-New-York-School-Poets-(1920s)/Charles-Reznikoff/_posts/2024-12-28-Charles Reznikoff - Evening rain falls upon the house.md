quote: "Evening rain falls upon the house;  
  shadows lengthen  
  as the night creeps in,  
  I gather my thoughts,  
a warmth within this solitude,  
the rhythm of drops on the roof,  
dancing with the darkness."

Evening rain falls upon the house;  
  shadows lengthen  
  as the night creeps in,  
  I gather my thoughts,  
a warmth within this solitude,  
the rhythm of drops on the roof,  
dancing with the darkness.

- Charles Reznikoff
