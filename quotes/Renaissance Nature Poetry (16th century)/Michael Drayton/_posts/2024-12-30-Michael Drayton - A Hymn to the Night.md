A Hymn to the Night
O Night! all stars thou bringest forth,
With sable raiment clad,
With peace so pure you usher light,
And rid the inner sad.

The shadows lie, but hope is bright,
In slumber, sweet and clear,
The thanks of all in gentle sleep
O Night! lie deep and near.

As flowers greet with dew-drops pure,
And prayer are swayed to thee,
Thy dark embrace, in sweet secure,
Does comfort hearts set free.

To thee, I raise my voice so high, 
As moonbeams dance awake,
And touch the earth with love anew,
With every heart you'd break.

So let us soar, adorn the night,
As dreams do ambush throng,
With silent joy this sacred hour,
In praises to your song.


- Michael Drayton
