Under skies with hues unfurled,
   The dance of clouds fills wide and free,
   Where sunsets stain the quiet world,
   And stars are born in reverie.

   The laughter of the wind persists,
   A symphony with nature’s sighs,
   From valleys deep, where silence lifts,
   To echo softly through the skies.

   In every sound, a heart that beats,
   In every dawn, a chance to grow,
   For life is whispered in the streets,
   Where flowers bloom and rivers flow.

- T E Lawrence
