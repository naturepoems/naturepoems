In The Wood

In the wood, where ferns do twine,  
And mosses soft as velvet lie;  
Ribbons of gold lay hills of green,  
Across the woodland, effects, lie.  
The echoes of the olivet trees  
Whisper cradles soft note;  
The light drips gentle through their boughs—  
Who knows who lies beneath their coat!  
Among the cress and water lilies  
No truer love than nature's kiss;  
Find me, as winds sway beneath the trees,  
To be lost somewhere in apparent bliss.

- Sarah Orne Jewett
