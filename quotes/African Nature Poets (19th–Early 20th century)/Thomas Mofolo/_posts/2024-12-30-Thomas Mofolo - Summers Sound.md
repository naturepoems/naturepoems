When raindrops kiss the thirsty ground,  
And the air is sweet with summer's sound,  
A symphony of life begins to bloom,  
As nature shakes off the winter's gloom.

The flowers rise in vibrant cheer,  
Announcing the arrival of a new year,  
Creating a canvas of color and scent,  
A masterpiece of nature, beautifully spent.

- Thomas Mofolo
