Nature never did betray
The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege
Through all the years of this our life, to lead
From joy to joy: for she can so inform
The mind that is within us, so impress
With quietness and beauty, and so feed
With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,
Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,
Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all

The dreary intercourse of daily life,
Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb
Our cheerful faith that all which we behold
Is full of blessings. . . . Though nothing can bring back
The hour
Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;

We will grieve not, rather find
Strength in what remains behind;
In the primal sympathy
Which having been must ever be;
In the thought of God that comes
To me from the向 of hills and from the vale.

And we will grieve not, rather find
Strength in what remains behind;
In the primal sympathy
Which having been must ever be;
In the thought of God that comes
To me from theہوں of hills and from the vale.

I was made aware of the world,
Of the sorrow that it is;

- William Wordsworth
