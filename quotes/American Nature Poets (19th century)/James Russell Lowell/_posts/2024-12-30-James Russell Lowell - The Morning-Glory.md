The Morning-Glory

So delicate, so bright,
  Blushing in the dew,
Among the tangled weeds it lies,
  Barely breaking through.

What tender sun shall warm you,
  Oh, morning-glory fair?
Your beautiful spirals shall twine
  Up the delicate air.

Reach for the dawnâ€™s bright fingers,
  To arise in the light,
The world shall ease in whispers,
  Gently take to flight.

- James Russell Lowell
