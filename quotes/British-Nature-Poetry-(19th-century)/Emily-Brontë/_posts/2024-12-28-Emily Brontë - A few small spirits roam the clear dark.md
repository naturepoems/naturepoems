A few small spirits roam the clear dark of stars,
But shadows claim the draw of night,
Yet from this earth I’ll rise, for a love, like ours,
Will scintillate through hidden light.

On sylvan hills I’ll tread softly where shadows fly,
And in the glades our laughter lies,
For every footstep brings me closer to the sky,
And through its pathways, lifts my sighs.


- Emily Brontë
