On yonder hill, the shadows play,
As dusk descends in easter’s sway,
Each blade of grass, a silver thread,
In the quilt of evening, softly spread.

Red poppies in the wane of light,
At twilight’s crown, a pure delight,
In every hue and every scent,
The sacred fields in beauty spent.

- John Betjeman
