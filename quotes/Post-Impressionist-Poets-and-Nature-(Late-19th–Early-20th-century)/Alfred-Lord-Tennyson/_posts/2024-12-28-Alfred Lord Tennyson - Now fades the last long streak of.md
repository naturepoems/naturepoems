Now fades the last long streak of snow,
Now burgeons every bush and tree,
Now shoots the lily from the snow,
And us the swan and lily meet.

The valleys with life’s caverns teem,
To cheer the heart and swell the dome,
Where, with a sweet and powerful dream,
The vision wanders from its home.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
