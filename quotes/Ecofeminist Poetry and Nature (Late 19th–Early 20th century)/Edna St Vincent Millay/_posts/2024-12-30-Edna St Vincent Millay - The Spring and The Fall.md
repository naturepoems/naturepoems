THE SPRING AND THE FALL

My heart is like a flower,
   That drops away from the stem,
When Time has bared his arm,
   And fleets, a weary thing,
   On the sun-blistered air.

Then I must stand and watch,
   As spring gives way to fall;
And all about me flutter
   The dried leaves of the past.

O Love! So sweet, so long,
   For a fleeting, wand’ring hour,
Has o’er me held its sway—
   The life that’s in the small,
In the folding of a rose,
   In the beating of my heart.

As Spring renews the Earth,
   So may it renew me too,
So I shall live again—
   Amid flower, leaf, and dew.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
