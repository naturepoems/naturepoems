The Rain
Upon the hills the rain descends,  
Kissing the earth with its gentle breath;  
Pouring soft where the green still bends,  
A cover for all life, even death.

Let me linger in the droppings cool,  
Feel the pulse of each falling tear;  
As nature gathers in silence to rule,  
The dance of the living will ne'er disappear.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
