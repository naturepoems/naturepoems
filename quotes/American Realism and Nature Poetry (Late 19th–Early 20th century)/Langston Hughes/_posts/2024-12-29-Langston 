My People

The Negroes are in the fields,
They are over the hills,
They are in the cities, the streets,
And are walking on the sidewalks.

The Negroes are under the sun,
They are in the veils of mist,
In the flow of the cool the wind,
And the warm embrace of day.

My people — nature's brothers,
With strength in every heart,
And love that binds the earth and more,
In lush fields, through rivers, we part.

Together we share in the bounty, love below,
For in every place and every sound,
In every heart is where we shall know,
That together we rise from harsh grounds.

- Langston Hughes
