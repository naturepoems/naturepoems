The Man with the Blue Guitar

I
Everything is a matter of degree.
This blue guitar, of bronze,
Plays slowly a note in vain
And the unaccustomed sky.

II
Forget not with nightâ€™s shadows,
The day, the moments rise,
A light with sound that gardens scream
To enter into this truth in vain.

III
For sound is not of silver alone,
It is as high as we think,
And the heart; we must enter the trees
In order.  Make a second round.
                                 


- Wallace Stevens
