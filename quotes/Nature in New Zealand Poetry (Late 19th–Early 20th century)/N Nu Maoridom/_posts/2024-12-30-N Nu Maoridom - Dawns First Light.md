Dawn's First Light

In hushed stillness, the dawn unfolds,
The golden rays, a tale retold,
With gentle hands, the night retreats,
In morning's warmth, the spirit beats.

The chorus of a new day's birth,
Reminds us of our sacred worth,
In every sunrise, hope ignites,
A promise held in nature’s rites.
