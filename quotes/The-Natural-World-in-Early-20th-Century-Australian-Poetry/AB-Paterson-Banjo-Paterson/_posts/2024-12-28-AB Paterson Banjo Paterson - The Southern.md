The Southern Cross
Out in the bush where the stars shine bright,
And the night wind makes the branches sigh,
We'll camp 'neath the Southern Cross tonight,
With the voluminous tenting sky.

So gather 'round as the tale is spun,
Of the brave who forged and died,
For beneath those twinkling stars as one,
The bonds of brotherhood abide.

- AB Paterson Banjo Paterson
