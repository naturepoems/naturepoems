The meadow in springtime,
   Where the wild flowers bloom,
And the fragrance of clover
   Hangs thick through the gloom.

When the lark in the morning
   On the wing doth arise,
And the light of the sunbeams
   Is a feast for the eyes.

Let me wander forever
   Where the soft breezes play,
For the beauty of Nature
   Is my heart's truest stay.

- James Fenimore Cooper
