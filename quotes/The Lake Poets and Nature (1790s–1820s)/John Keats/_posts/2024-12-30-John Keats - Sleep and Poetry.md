Sleep and Poetry
O, if in some warm nook it were allowed,
That I could sleep and see the day’s hues glow,
Filling all earthly sense with scents of crowd,
In nature's arms— a world without a woe; 

Wrapped in calm and sweet serenity—
Dreaming until the sunlight wakes; and then,
Realizing, growing bright much further free,
No gates shall interrupt this sweet repose again.


- John Keats
