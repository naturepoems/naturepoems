A Windfall

The wind has come and blown the leaves,
  The boughs sway down with glee;
In autumn’s rich and laden heart,
  A happy sight to see.

The fallen fruit is good and ripe,
  The vines stretch out their hands;
To gather all the golden gifts
  That nature's bounty lands.

In every gust upon the way,
  There’s sweet and secret song;
For in the gentle wind’s caress,
  Each heart shall beat along.


- Mary Gilmore
