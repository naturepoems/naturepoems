Nature's splendid fables,
   Enfold hearts in their care;
For each behold these stories,
   The earth becomes a rare affair.
From the swift green streamlet,
   To the mountain's crown,
Shall the boughs tremble softly,
   When the winds from fables drown.
Oh, in gardens where I wander,
   Softly drowsing, think of home,
In the memories that I gather.
   Nature sings back with its poem.

- Robert Browning
