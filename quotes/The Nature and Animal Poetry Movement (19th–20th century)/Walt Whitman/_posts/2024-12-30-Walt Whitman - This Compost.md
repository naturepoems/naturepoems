This Compost

Something in me is aware that it is alive,
And the woods that rustle in the air roam free,
The crickets chirp, and the frogs croak
It is there my heart finds its rest.

I grow from beneath it, and I thrive from above,
The sun shines bright, and the sky is blue,
I dance with the earth, I ebb with the tide,
In this compost, I find peace.


- Walt Whitman
