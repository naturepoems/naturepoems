The Stream   
Gentle, flowing, whispering stream,  
You dance and sparkle in the sun.  
With every pebble fostering dreams,  
You carry laughter and life; you run.  
Through the forest, across the field,  
Forever onward, never swayed,  
Nature's song is what you yield,  
A symphony in light and shade.

- Joyce Kilmer
