Eurydice

I am your trust,  
let it be diluted in the air.  
O sin,  
carry the scent of breath  
caught in growths,  
the motions  
of air  
between the trees,  
to my beauty—let the flowers flush like joy  
between the bud  
that nurtures its pulse.

The earth is folding underfoot,  
yet  
I wake, I question—all  
my nights are matter;  
will the winds twist backwards;  
town down!  
Like every essence:  
yet  
either let the dark moans break and grasp  
yonder silence’s plastic reach  
for me.
