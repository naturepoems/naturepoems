My heart leaps up when I behold
A rainbow in the sky:
So was it when my life began;
So is it now I am a man;
So be it when I shall grow old,
Or let me die!

Before my  eye shall see the light,
Or satisfy my soul with breath,
If I can keep a heart so rare,
May that spirit guide me anywhere,
Forever wise in every fight,
To live, not die in death.

- William Wordsworth
