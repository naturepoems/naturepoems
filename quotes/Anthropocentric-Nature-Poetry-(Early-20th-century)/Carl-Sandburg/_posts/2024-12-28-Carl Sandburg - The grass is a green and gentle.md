The grass is a green and gentle land.
Carry the silk of your dreams
on a summer breeze.
Hear the whispers of life
in the quiet corners of earth.
Find the songs the petals sing
and beware of fruitless weeds.
For life wraps its arms around the heart,
between the roots and the flowers
until the last bloom fades.

- Carl Sandburg
