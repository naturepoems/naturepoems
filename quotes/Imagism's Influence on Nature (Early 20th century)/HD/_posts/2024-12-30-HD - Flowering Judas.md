Flowering Judas

I looked in and saw the tree,  

in undulating movements,

the shadow 

of the moon and the roses.

Whose perfume gives sweetness,

in the night;  

the incense burning,

is the voice contained 

without the touch of the flower

and the soiled air.

In the dusk,  

call out to the trees,

in this breath.

I touched you once,

when the blooms broke open,

and I can remember

flowering letters,  

between you and me.
