After the Rain

After the rain, when the sky's a pearl,
    The world is washed and fresh anew,
Each leaf and flower starts to twirl,
    Under a sky of softest blue.
The scent of earth hangs in the air,
    While dewdrops cling to every sprout,
It's in the stillness, so rich and rare,
    That I hear nature’s gentle shout.
