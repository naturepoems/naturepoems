A day is but time, a cycle in trust,
The wind that rustles the leaves and dust,
Each season a chapter of beauty and plight,
Worshipped by day and adored by night.

To walk through the grove where the wildflowers sway,
Like souls in communion with love's soft play,
Paradise modeled in colors so bright,
Where nature unravels her splendorous sight.

A canvas of layers, crafted with care,
To gaze at her wondersâ€”a balm to compare,
For in her embrace, all sorrows relent,
As if in each blade, a universe lent.

- Frank Norris
