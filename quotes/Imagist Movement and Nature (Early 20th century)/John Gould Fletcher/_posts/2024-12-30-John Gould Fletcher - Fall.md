Fall
In the coolness of the autumn hours,
When leaves spin softly to the earth,
And gentle winds lie softly on every brow,
Nature lays her vibrant palette,
With tints of red and gold,
Across the hills where shadows play.
It is a time of gathering,
A gentle time of thanks for all that was.


- John Gould Fletcher
