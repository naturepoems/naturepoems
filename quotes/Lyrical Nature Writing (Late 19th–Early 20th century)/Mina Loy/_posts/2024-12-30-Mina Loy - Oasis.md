In the midst of all chaos,
There lies the order of the universe,
Where stones cluster, unmoved,
In the matins of dawn.
We must kneel to find
The alignment of our breath,
To consider the slow embrace
Of bark and seeding coral.
The painting of the sea changes
With each undulation of the winds.
Become less, dear, become less,
Until we fall together,
As sand to water,
And construct our oasis

- Mina Loy
