The April Wind

The April wind, it sweeps the hills,  
   With whispers soft and low;  
And through the fields and open meads,  
   In every nook, does blow.  
The flowers quiver in delight,  
   As nature's touch is found  
In every breath that stirs the air,  
   In every sight around.  

â€“ Laurence Binyon
