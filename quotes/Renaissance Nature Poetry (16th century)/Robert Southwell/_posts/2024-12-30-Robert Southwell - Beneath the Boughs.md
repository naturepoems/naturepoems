Beneath the boughs of ancient trees,
Where whispers float upon the breeze,
I find my peace in nature’s fold,
Where stories of the earth are told.
The birds resound with sacred tones,
Amidst the flowers they make their homes;
O, how the world in splendor lies,
In nature’s eyes, eternal skies.

- Robert Southwell
