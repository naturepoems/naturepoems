As the river flows to the sea,
So my heart flows to you, my dear,
For the waters carry whispers soft,
A melody sweet, a song sincere.
In every ripple, a memory flows,
In every wave, affection grows,  
And as the sun sets soft and low,
Iâ€™ll love you still through every flow.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
