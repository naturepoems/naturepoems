The River

Oh flowing river, swift and free,  
A symphony of earth and sky,  
With every bend and twist you take,  
You teach my heart to fly.  
I hear your laughter bubbling clear,  
A song of peace and grace,  
As you carry the dreams of the hills  
To the vast and waiting space.

- A E George William Russell
