Reflections in Nature
 
In nature’s mirror, I find my true face,
Amongst the soft petals and the roots’ warm embrace,
Every stream a reflection of thoughts in my mind,
In this tranquil haven, the peace that I find.

The mountains stand guard, wise and so grand,
With stories of ages etched deep in the land,
And the rivers, they flow like the dreams of my heart,
In this dance of existence, I play my own part.

So listen in silence, let your heart be your guide,
For the whispers of nature invite you inside,
In each rustling leaf and each star’s gentle gleam,
You’ll find the reflections of your wildest dream.

- Chris OCarroll
