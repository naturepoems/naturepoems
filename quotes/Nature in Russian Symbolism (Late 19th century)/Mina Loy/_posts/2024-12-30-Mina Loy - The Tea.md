The tea
as if steaming?  Was it?  No
it was unaltered, this
void of vision, a weft of air —
what was that light?  How then?
Tangled among trunks to the hight
of brittle ether, a page effaced
forgetting, leaving the moments wreathed
back again to smooth, adrift,
where motion dips
in chasing sunlight —
a tree shaping shadow upon rock.

- Mina Loy
