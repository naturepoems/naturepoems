Upon these hills, amid these groves,  
By streams that sparkle in the sun,  
I think of all the joys that love  
Can bring to heart and soul as one;  

The honeyâ€™d warmness of the air,  
The blooming fragrance of the rose,  
As Nature's hand lays everywhere  
A path where sweetest pleasure flows.

- Michael Drayton
