The Nightingale

Where rustling wood and tangled vine
    And fragrant flower meet,
I often hear, like love’s own sign,
    The nightingale’s sweet feet.

But in my heart a bitter ache,
    No song can ever heal;
Yet still I hear the nightingale break,
    In music, from the field.

And as the twilight grasps the sky,
    I listen long and deep;
For then, when shadows softly lie,
    The nightingale sings sweet.

- John Shaw Neilson
