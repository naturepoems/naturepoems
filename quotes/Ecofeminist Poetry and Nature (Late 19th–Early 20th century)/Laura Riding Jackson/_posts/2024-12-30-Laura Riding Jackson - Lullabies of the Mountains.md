The mountains rise like ancient guards,
Their peaks kissed by eternal skies,
With every whisper of the wind,
I hear the earth’s great lullabies.

Cradling valleys in their arms,
They hold the stories deep in stone,
And with each step upon their paths,
I find a piece of me, my own.

- Laura Riding Jackson
