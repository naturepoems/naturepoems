Ode to the Fjords

Majestic fjords, your splendor grand,
Carved by glaciers, shaped by hand,
Your waters deep, reflections pure,
In your presence, the heart finds cure.

Cliffs that tower, silent and steep,
Into your depths, the heavens creep,
Cradled by mountains, draped in mist,
In every moment, nature's kiss.

To roam your shores, to hear you sigh,
To watch the clouds drift slowly by,
O sacred ground, where spirits roam,
In your embrace, we find our home.


- Anna Maria Møller
