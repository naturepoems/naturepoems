Nature

To be a poet is to be a visionary,
To see water beyond the horizon,
To draw a picture of night in day,
To find the presence in the absent.

Nature is a vast conflux;
Interlaced in life and light,  
In air and earth—dust and fire,  
In all its powers, its transformations  
And splendours—and its quiet,  
The sadness of the stars;  
How she reveals herself in silence,  
In the melodies of birds at dawn,  
In the calmness of the sea at sunset.

Nature gives to the observant mind  
What we need, if we could but see;  
Nature heals where she may,  
And the heart finds peace in her beauty.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
