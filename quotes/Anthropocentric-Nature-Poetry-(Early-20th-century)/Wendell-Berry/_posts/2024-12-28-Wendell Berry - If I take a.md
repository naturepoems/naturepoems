If I take a moment,
   and stand among the trees,
   I can hear the roots
   knit the ancient softly,
   binding the past with the present.

   Each breeze carries with it
   the laughter of the brook,
   a brimming hope that tumbles
   through stones, rejoicing.
I fill my lungs with clean air,
   and I know, here, I am home,
   a traveler both lost and found,
   in rhythm with this nightly grace.


- Wendell Berry
