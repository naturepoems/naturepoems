To an Ocean Liner
Thou ship of wondrous form  
With sails like wings  
That cut the silver sky.  
Bound for distant shores,  
Thy journey is beyond our dreams—  
Forth with the wind;  
The sky, the waves, they welcome thee,  
In the dance of nature's beauty.  

I see thy form recede,  
Flash crimson in the sunset's light,  
And long for thee to come  
And tell me tales of lands afar  
Where the earth wears bright colors,  
And the sea sings sweetly  
A soothing lullaby.




- Robert Louis Stevenson
