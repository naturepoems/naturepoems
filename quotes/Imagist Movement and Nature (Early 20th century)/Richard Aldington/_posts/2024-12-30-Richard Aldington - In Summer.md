In Summer

Once more the summer stands
Like a poised goblet,
And hangs above the unmoored sands
Of a resplendent beach.

Under the rich lilac trees,
The joyous shimmering
Trembles like a child.
Filling the world without pause-
Like a mirage, the drowsy waters
Invade my impulse.

Among the velvet arches
The passion of the deep
Takes to wing, and onward goes,
Where instinct strolls,
Now here! now there!â€”
A burning sun's exposure.
Long may it be!

- Richard Aldington
