Snowstorms

The snow is on the ground,
And the wintry winds do blow,
Uncovering the ground,
The scenes of long ago.

Here is a silent world,
Its spirit ever remains,
In the falling snow unfurled,
A beauty uncontained.

The trees now bowed so low,
In white, for the winter's power,
Remain but a memory of woe,
In each drooping, drifting flower.

The warmth of life will return,
With the glowing spring's embrace,
And from nature, we shall learn,
The cycle of time, its grace.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
