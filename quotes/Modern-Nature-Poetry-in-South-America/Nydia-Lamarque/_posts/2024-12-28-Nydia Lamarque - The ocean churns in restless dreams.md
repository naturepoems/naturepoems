The ocean churns in restless dreams,  
Waves sculpt the shore with passion,  
Each ebb a farewell, every flow a return,  
Whispers of salt and timelessness.  
Seagulls circle in jubilant arcs,  
As the horizon blushes crimson,  
Painting the sky a masterpiece,  
Where the land meets the vast unknown.

- Nydia Lamarque
