HYMN TO GOD, MY GOD, IN SICKNESS

Since I am coming to that holy room,
Where, with thy choir of saints for evermore,
I shall be made thy music; as I come,
I tune the instrument here at the door,
And what I must do then, think here before.

As I am ready to put up the day,
So ready are you to part; must I keep
In silence still? But thy leaf me away,
As is the end of day, and sea, deep
Deeper have hath God, all must bow my head.

These can be pains of hell to them that feel,
But all to thee, the full orchestration may be proof.
If I am gone, yet shall I come again:
My love, thy groves shall make unto me sound.

A prayer that I curl my lips, with thy utmost care,
Prepare to exhaust me, if thou wilt take on earth.
For thy love's sake, O God, dart me those rays,
And I shall plead my humble heart to thee.

When my soul takes flight — conducting, gliding —
I long for those that feed thy flames of praise.
Trustingly loved, those tunes will enter thine; 
Please receive me, as a herald of your grace!

- John Donne
