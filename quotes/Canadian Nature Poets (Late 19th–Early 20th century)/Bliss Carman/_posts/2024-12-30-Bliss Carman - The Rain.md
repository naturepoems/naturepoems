THE RAIN

The rain comes down on the brown green earth;  
And under the mists that rise anew  
The flowers bloom in a rare bright birth,  
And shake with joy in the airy dew.

The swinging leaves, as again they rise,  
Stand open wide to catch the light,  
With tears of love in the summer skies  
That fall and gleam in their rich delight.

The petals drink with a soft delight,  
And shake with joy at every turn;  
They break the silence with laughter light  
As the rain goes down and the blossoms burn.
