Ode to the birch tree, whose leaves whisper sweet  

With a song of the winds through their delicate sigh,  

Standing firm, unyielding, in heart of the heat,  

A sentinel dressed in the moonâ€™s silver tie.


You're a haven of stories, of dreams unconfined,  

With a grace that enfolds all who seek solace here,  

Through seasons of sunlight, of rain intertwined,  

In your presence, sweet guardian, all worries disappear.

- Alice Dunbar-Nelson
