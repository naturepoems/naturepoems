The Night Sky

Underneath the vast expanse,
Of the night’s velvet cloak,
Stars twinkle like secrets,
Whispering tales of the ages,
In a language only the heart knows.

The moon hangs like hope,
Casting silver upon the ground,
Where dreams and reality intertwine,
In the stillness of night,
Where everything becomes possible.

Each breath is a prayer,
To the beauty above,
As I stand in wonder,
Beneath the celestial embrace,
Of the universe’s endless dance.

- Konstantīns Raudive
