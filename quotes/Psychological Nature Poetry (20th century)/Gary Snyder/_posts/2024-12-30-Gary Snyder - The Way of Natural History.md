The Way of Natural History

No one knows the way,
I tell you nothing new,
but around my feet lie
open pages of knowledge,
shining in the sunlight,
utterly familiar,
from here to the end of the pale world.
All the songs of the birds,
bodies of the fish,
flowering stones,
yeasts of the ground,
stories of the stars,
all speak longing, all speak love.

- Gary Snyder
