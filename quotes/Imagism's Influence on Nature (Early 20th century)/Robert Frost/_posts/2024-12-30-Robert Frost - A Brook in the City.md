A Brook in the City
I am almost there, I can rest and be still,
By the sweet stream and the quiet land, the land of quietness and peace.
And weep, I think, for a home forever lost!
For I know the breadth of blooming flowers, the fluttering gold,
The meadow where I ran as wild as the early birds.

But today I am in a city, shut up in the tall walls
As I wait for a call from nature, the trees.
I am silent, I hear them calling, singing for my return.

And when I finally come to the gates;
A brook flies downward, ambling free,
I step back to the silent forest again.
I am whole, I can breathe!

- Robert Frost
