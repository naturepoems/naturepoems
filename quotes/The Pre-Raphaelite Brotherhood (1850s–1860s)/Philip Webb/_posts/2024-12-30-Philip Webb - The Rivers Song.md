The River’s Song

O gentle stream that wanders by,
With whispers soft, beneath the sky;
You carry tales of earth and time,
In every ripple, nature's rhyme.

Through meadows wide, your waters flow,
A silver path where wildflowers grow;
In sunshine bright and shadow’s dance,
You weave the heart in nature’s trance.

May I beside your banks abide,
In every moment, learn and glide;
For in your depths, the world is drawn,
In river’s song, the soul is pawned.


- Philip Webb
