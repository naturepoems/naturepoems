In the garden, thrilling with sun,
Where the scented coneflowers sway,
In depths of violet twilight done,
The crystal brook sings to the day.

A lily blooms, a rose will fade,
Nothing can stay the youth of spring.
Yet nature whispers, unafraid,
Of the beauty that changes everything.


- Rupert Brooke
