The Dawn

Oh, to linger in that moment,
  When the sun slips through the trees,
And breathes out light like fragrance,
  Breathing, watching, smiling:
I rise from the winter full of dreams,
  Flowering in song and sky,
Free of shackles, letting my heart soar,
  With the rays of morning light!

- D H Lawrence
