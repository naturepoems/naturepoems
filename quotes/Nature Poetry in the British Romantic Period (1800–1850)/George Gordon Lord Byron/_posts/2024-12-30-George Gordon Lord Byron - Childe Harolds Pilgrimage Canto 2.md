The mountains look on Marathon—
And Marathon looks on the sea;
And musing there an hour alone,
I dreamed that Greece might still be free;
For standing on the Persians' grave,
I could not deem myself a slave.

A boy in the clerical learn,
Whose wandering fancy had not learned
The breath of Freedom, as woods turn
To note each whisper upward burned;
Great like thy forests, and pine-hills,
By ocean's promise, free from their ills.


- George Gordon Lord Byron
