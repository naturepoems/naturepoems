Anecdote of the Jar

I placed a jar in Tennessee,
And round it was, upon a hill.
It made the slovenly wilderness
Surround that hill.

The wilderness rose up to it,
And sprawled around, no longer wild.
The jar was round upon the ground
And tall and of a port in air.

It took dominion everywhere.
The jar was gray and bare.
It did not give of bird or bush
Like nothing else in Tennessee.

When the darkened trees, the pines,
In the higher areas climbed the hill,
And were aware of the distance,
It was not prescribed for the humors of the wild.

But there was time for hope and a way,
Of hope bereaved of forms beside the jar.
And round about it, the wilderness
Lay, no longer wild.


- Wallace Stevens
