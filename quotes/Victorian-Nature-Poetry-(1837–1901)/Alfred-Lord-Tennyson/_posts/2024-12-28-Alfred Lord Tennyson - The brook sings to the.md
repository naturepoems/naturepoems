The brook, sings to the willow,
Softly murmuring along,
The guileless gentle echo
Lifts to me its song.

It is the heart of nature,
Full of life, and light, and glee,
And it calls, with softest whispers,
To the soul of me.

"Is it not for thee, dear lady,
At the day of summer’s prime?
When the sun-kissed flowers
In their glory brave the time?"

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
