Mother Earth

Ah Mother Earth,
Thou art beauty to behold,
Your colors burst
In every season's fold.

From the emerald green of summer,
To the gold of autumn's glow,
You cradle life in your embrace,
Where rivers and time flow.

Through the storms and the sunlight,
You nurture tender buds,
While mountains rise in might,
And the winds carry sweet thuds.

Ah Mother Earth,
Whisper your ancient tales,
For in your arms of serenity,
The world of nature prevails.

- Langston Hughes
