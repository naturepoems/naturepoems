The Dream Keeper
Bring me all of your dreams,
You dreamers,
Bring me all of your heart melodies,
That I may wrap them
In a blue cloud-cloth
Away from the prying eyes
Of the world.

Guarded with my life, my dreams,
To lock them away,
The flowers shall dance,
And the rivers shall flow,
And in the sun's embrace,
  Nature shall sway.

- Langston Hughes
