Whispers of the Wind

The wind carries secrets through the trees,
Soft whispers hidden in the night,
They rustle leaves and kiss the earth,
A gentle touch, a pure delight.

In every breeze, a story told,
Of love, of loss, of time's embrace,
The heart listens, to nature's call,
And finds its peace, its resting place.


- Anna Akhmatova
