The river flows with stories entwined,
A winding ribbon of fate and repose,
Reflecting the sky’s vast, deep azure,
And the secrets that nature only knows.

Here, in this moment, time holds its breath,
And life feels like a poem in bloom,
With every ripple, a memory flows,
Drawing me close to earth’s gentle loom.


- Anna Akhmatova
