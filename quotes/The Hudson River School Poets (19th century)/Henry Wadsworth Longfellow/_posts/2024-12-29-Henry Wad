Autumn Song

The Golden-rod is yellow;  
The corn is turning brown;  
The trees in apple orchards  
With fruit are bending down.

The gentian's bluest fringes  
Are curling in the sun;  
In golden-rod and asters  
The butterflies are spun.

The maple's scarlet berries  
Have taken the sunset's hue;  
The air is full of music;  
And happy seem the view.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
