Our Hundred Days
In summerâ€™s glory, bright and gay,
I wander through the fields at play,
Where blossoms gleam like stars at night
And make the heart burst forth with light.

I see the sun-kissed azure hills,
I scent the sweetness of the rills,
I hear the swells that fill my ears,
And there I gather all my fears.

Yet when the night creeps on its way,
Through clouds that softly cross the day,
And the moon shines down on all that dreamed,
I chase the fleeting memory stream'd.

Thus in those Hundred Days we find
A glimmer of the heart and mind,
Where nature whispers, ever wise,
The treasures wrought beneath the skies.

- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr
