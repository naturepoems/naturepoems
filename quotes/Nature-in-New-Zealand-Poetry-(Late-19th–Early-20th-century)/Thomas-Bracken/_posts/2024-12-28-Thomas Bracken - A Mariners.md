A Mariner's Song
 
O’er the vast, tumultuous sea,
Where the winds of heaven howl,
We glide, when the storm has gone—
The stars in their glimmering stroll.

The waves, they dance and whisper,
As the sails catch the breath of the night,
With moonlit faces, aglow,
We seek for the dawn’s soft light.

Ah, the land holds promise,
Yet the sky holds more charms,
For wild is the heart, where the sea
And the starry night call in their arms.

- Thomas Bracken
