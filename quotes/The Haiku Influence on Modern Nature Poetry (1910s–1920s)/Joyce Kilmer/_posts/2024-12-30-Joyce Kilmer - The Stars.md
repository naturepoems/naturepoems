The stars are like the clouds above,  
They scatter through the night;  
The whole world’s pulsing in that love  
And drawing in the light.  

Softly they sing through shadows deep  
As fragrant night’s embrace;  
The world of mortals drifts to sleep,  
In cosmos’ vastness grace.  

Yet in the earth, the breath of life  
In harmony still flows;  
For nature’s peace is wide as night —  
And radiant periods grows.

- Joyce Kilmer
