Sunset

When the sun sinks low to kiss the hills,  
And the world is wrapped in twilightâ€™s thrill;  
The sky ignites in a blaze of hue,  
As potential day gives way to night anew.  

Golden rays spill across the land,  
Painting portraits of shadows so grand;  
And whispers of nature, soft as a sigh,  
Take wing to dance in the canvas of sky.  

Each moment fleeting, yet forever stored,  
In the heart of the earth, where her beauty is poured;  
So let us linger as day bids adieu,  
And embrace the magic life offers anew.

- E J Brady
