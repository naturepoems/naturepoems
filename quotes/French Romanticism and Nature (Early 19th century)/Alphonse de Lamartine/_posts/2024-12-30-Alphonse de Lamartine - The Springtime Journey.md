The Springtime Journey

A courier of life, with fragrant breath,  
The springtime comes, reviving all;  
With petals soft, and blooms of health,  
In eager colors, boldly call.

The brook, it giggles, plays in joy,  
As daisies nod, their heads all day;  
The sun doth smile, a radiant ploy,  
As sweet the air, in soft ballet.

O Spring! My heart sings forth your name,  
In nature’s rhythm, love’s own frame;  
Awake my spirit, wild and true,  
With every flower, I dance with you.

- Alphonse de Lamartine
