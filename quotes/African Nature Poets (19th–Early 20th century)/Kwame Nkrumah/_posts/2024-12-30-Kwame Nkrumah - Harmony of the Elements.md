Harmony of the Elements
Fire's fierce dance, water's soft sigh,
Earth's sturdy embrace, and air that flies high.
Together they harmonize, a symphony grand,
In the heart of existence, they form nature's band.

With whispers of fire and cooling of streams,
In every breath taken, in every dream.
They teach us of balance, of strength and of grace,
In the dance of the elements, we all find our place.

- Kwame Nkrumah
