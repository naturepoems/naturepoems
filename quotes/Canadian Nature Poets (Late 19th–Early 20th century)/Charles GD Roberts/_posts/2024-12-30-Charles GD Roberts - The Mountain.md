The Mountain

The mountain towers, a giant bold,  
  With granite heart and soul,  
That touches blue infinity,  
  And lends the skies their whole;  
For through the clouds, a peak of pride,  
  Stands sentinel of land,  
A fortress old, where legends live,  
  Forever strong and grand.

I wander high through rocky trails,  
  And feel the strength divine,  
A feeling in my every vein,  
  A spirit grand and fine.  
For in the solitude of heights,  
  I breathe the mountain's fire,  
With every step, I claim the land,  
  And rise with wild desire.

A marriage twixt the earth and sky,  
  Where eagles dare to soar,  
The mountain holds my heart within  
  And opens every door.  
So here I stand, a soul set free,  
  To know, at last, my worth,  
For in the grandeur of the peak,  
  I find the heart of earth.

- Charles GD Roberts
