No coward soul is mine,
No trembler in the world’s storm-troubled sphere:
I see heaven’s glories shine,
And faith shines equal arming me from fear.

O God within my breast,
Almighty ever-present Deity!
Life—that in me has rest,
As I,—undying Life,—have power in Thee!

Vainly the fowler’s eye
Might mark my feathers for a scarlet dress,
Distrust would have to die,
And faith would build a rainbow in the wilderness.

I’ll bless the light that shines,
And idols I will tear from their foundation:
I’ll raise thy cross of mine,
As by it I beheld the world’s salvation.

Firm in the strength of Heaven,
I seek my own way through the woods and the night:
God, I know I have striven,
But those battles don’t frighten me, with Your light.

I am the bright southern star,
I don’t need fear to scare me away:
In life’s dark, secret hour,
Your beauty draws me back from the cold clay.


- Emily Brontë
