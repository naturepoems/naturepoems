Softly, it drifts, a whimsical being,
Painting the sky with transient dreams,
Shadow then light, an ethereal form,
Making the heavens a canvas divine."

The Cloud
Softly, it drifts, a whimsical being,
Painting the sky with transient dreams,
Shadow then light, an ethereal form,
Making the heavens a canvas divine.
