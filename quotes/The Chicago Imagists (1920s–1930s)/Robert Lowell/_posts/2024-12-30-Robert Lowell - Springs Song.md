Spring's Song
by Robert Lowell

When the flowers bloom,  
each petal sings  
a hymn to the sky,  
they rise in a chorus  
under the warm sun,  
a celebration of life.

The air is sweet with promise,  
as buds unfold their dreams,  
a testament to the vibrant  
bounty of spring,  
each day a new hope,  
a nature renewing herself.

- Robert Lowell
