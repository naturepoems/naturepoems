In the stillness of winter's grasp,
Where frost kisses earth with a delicate touch,
The trees stand like sentinels, stoic and proud,
Their limbs adorned with crystalline white.

Silence deepens, a sacred hush,
Only the crunch of snow beneath my feet;
In this frozen realm, time stands still,
Nature breathes softly, a lullaby sweet.

- Sigbjørn Obstfelder
