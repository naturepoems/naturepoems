author: Mina Loy
quote: "Veins of rivers pulse with movement,
A canvas of stillness interrupted,
By the adventurous flit of dragonflies,
Reciting odes to the warm embrace of sun,
Color splashed over the broad shoulders of hills,
Nature, an open book—
Each season edits what it sees,
Telling tales of harmony and discord,
From tender sprigs to dormant drafts."

Veins of rivers pulse with movement,
A canvas of stillness interrupted,
By the adventurous flit of dragonflies,
Reciting odes to the warm embrace of sun,
Color splashed over the broad shoulders of hills,
Nature, an open book—
Each season edits what it sees,
Telling tales of harmony and discord,
From tender sprigs to dormant drafts.
