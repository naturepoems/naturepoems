There, where the river laughs and fields grow tall,  
I wander through the emerald glades alone;  
For nature’s hand has painted every wall,  
With shades and colors in a world of stone.  
The pebbles whisper tales of time gone by,  
While clouds weave softly through the azure sky;  
And in the twilight, stars begin to peep,  
As nature sings her lullaby to sleep.

- Bliss Carmen
