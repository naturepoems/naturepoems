Out in the fields where the wildflowers bloom,
Under the azure sky extending,
They laugh in their colors, dispelling the gloom,
With scents that are gently blending.

The sun's golden fingers brush gently above,
Kissing petals and leaves with fond care.
In this circle of life, there reigns only love,
Nature's bounty is abundantly fair.

- Anna Brigadere
