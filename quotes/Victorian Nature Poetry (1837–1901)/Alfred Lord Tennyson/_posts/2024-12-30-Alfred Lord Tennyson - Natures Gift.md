Nature, with countless gifts, and sweet  
With thorns and pleasures in her train;  
Reminds us of the bitter-sweet  
Emotions that we feel again.

When at her feet we gaze entranced,  
In silence breathe the grateful air,  
Our spirit dances, and is chanced  
To be caught in Nature’s snare.

The harmony that winds its thread  
‘Twixt beauty, love, and lust must flow;  
O nature’s gift, in dreams we tread,  
Where beauty and the breezes blow.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
