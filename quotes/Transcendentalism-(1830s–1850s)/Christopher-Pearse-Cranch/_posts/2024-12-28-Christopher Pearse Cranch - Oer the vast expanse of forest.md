O'er the vast expanse of forest glades,
Where wood and water meet and gently creep,
The starry night its solemn vesture lays,
And all the world in shimmering silence sleep.
As I in solitude traverse the ways,
A radiant figure glimmers through the gloom,
The sudden silver beams, like feathery rays,
Transform the night and chase away the tomb.

This transient beauty, fleeting as a sigh,
Holds captive every care; we live divine,
In every glance—more high—more deep we fly,
As stars that glitter on the moonlit line.

To follow nature's call, in peace we share,
The secret echoes of the midnight air.

- Christopher Pearse Cranch
