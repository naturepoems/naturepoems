The River

O wandering river, we twain are one;  
With thy silver glance and the morning’s sun,  
Beckoning me forth through the woods it flows —  
Where the willow bough dips like a plume of bows.

And into the vale where the wildflowers grow;  
And the wild birds sing, as they flutter and flow;  
There in the meadow, by thee I’m drawn,  
For the heart of nature shall beckon the dawn.


- G L D Mackay
