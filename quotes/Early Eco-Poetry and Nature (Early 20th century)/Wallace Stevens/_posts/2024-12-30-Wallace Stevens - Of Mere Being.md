Of Mere Being

The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of the sea
And has no consciousness of being.
When there is only a palm.
A palm that stands alone,
Where the sea joins a beach,
Alone and left up to its top,
Ends in a fern and a bright light.

O palm, at moments, touched, behold your shadow!
Your shadow and silence is present and echoing
In the quiet of the world; strong in solitude.
Touch of the wind, the whisper, the echo.

- Wallace Stevens
