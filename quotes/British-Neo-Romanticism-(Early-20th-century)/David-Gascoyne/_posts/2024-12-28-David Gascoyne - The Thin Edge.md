The Thin Edge  
As the storm breaks,  
A thin edge of tree  
Separates the sky  
From the mountain,  
The faintest ripple  
Between bloom and  
The fall of rain—  
The life of suffering  
Condensed;  
And the wasted wail  
Of ancient watchers  
Casts its shadows to me  
From the crags above.  

At evening I hear  
The rustling tide  
Of flowers beneath  
The ache of the high rocks,  
Drifting down like sighs  
From the depths of the darkness  
Where the last light glimmers  
Before the eclipse of the day.  

I hear stillness—  
And past that thin edge  
Where the world unravels,  
I see the stars drip  
Like the blood of an evening,  
Soiled over its veils of dusk.

- David Gascoyne
