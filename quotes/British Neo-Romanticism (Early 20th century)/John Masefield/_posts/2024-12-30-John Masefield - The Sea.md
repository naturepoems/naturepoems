The Sea

For much do I see, as the music begun,
The glimmer of sailing upon the blurred line,
And a leaf must whisper in reply the sun;
For sunset and summits, the stars shall all shine!

In the hush of my heart, deep and gaunt dispraise,
Shall sing of the winds when at length they leave town;
For the houses of water glow with from all that grace,
And I may drown again when the glass goes down!

Blue thickets of drop where the treasures throng,
And much shall confine me upon the waves’ shots
For the tumbling of sounds have much held it wrong—
Their flight spins across the horizons caught.

To drink to those winds once more as they smile!
When the water and light are from waters quelled—
Then we glance on the turn and unveil to compile!
A vision more strange must be richly unveiled!

- John Masefield
