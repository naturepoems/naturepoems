The Dew
---

Morning comes crisp and bright,
With dew upon the grass, a sight,
Like diamonds laid upon the ground,
A gift from night, so sweet, profound.

Each drop a mirror, reflecting dreams,
The world awakes in quiet gleams,
As life begins anew to sing,
A soft reminder of each spring.

---

In every droplet, the cosmos named,
In tender nature, we are reclaimed.


- Henry David Thoreau
