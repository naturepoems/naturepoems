The moon locked in the earth's embrace,
       A crown of light,
              Whispering over fields,
Fractured ruins of the day.

           Above, the stars are scattered,
Little seeds of silver in the night,
        Each a story,
               Each a wish.

  I walk beneath this canopy,
Where in silence the dark
           Holds its breath,
And the shadows dance,
               Fleeting and soft.

- Sylvia Plath
