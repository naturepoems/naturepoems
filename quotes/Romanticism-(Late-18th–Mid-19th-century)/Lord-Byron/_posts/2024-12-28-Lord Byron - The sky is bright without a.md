The sky is bright without a cloud,
And all on earth is well—the moon
Has drifted in, with silver shroud,
To calm the evening’s soothing tune.

And here we walk, the faceless trees,
The shade of silence lies between,
Our thoughts blend sweetly like a breeze
That chases leaves upon a green.

The waves erupt in distant lines,
They hold our whispered tales within,
For Nature makes the stars define
And mock our vanity of sin.

Oh! Life, in its ethereal dance,
Shall hold the secrets of the sea,
Yet in the coolness of romance,
We’ll share this harmony—just you and me.

- Lord Byron
