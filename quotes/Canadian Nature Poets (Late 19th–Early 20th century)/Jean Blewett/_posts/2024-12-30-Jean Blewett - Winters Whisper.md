When winter’s cloak of white enfolds,
The world in silence draped so wide,
Each flake like gentle whisper told,
Where secrets of the frost abide.

In the chill, there's still a grace,
In the glimmer of the frosty morn,
Nature in her purest face,
From which the hopeful heart is born.

- Jean Blewett
