There is a tree
 that springs from the green ground,
 and there is trouble in the sky above.
 The tree stands on a shore of silence,
 and first of all,
 it was a branching tree in green,
 a branch pushing through the roof of the sky
 giving a clean cut to the evening sun.
 There is a wind and the wind is whispering.
 The sky is wide and the word is diamond.

- Carl Sandburg
