Summer's Day
by Robert Lowell

Oh I love the summer's day  
when the leaves cut a ripple  
in the shimmering smooth air,  
like sunlight on the skin,  
like wind blowing rippling hair.

I love the way we breathe,  
the sibilance of the leaves,  
the rustling murmur of the stream  
that flows, flows endlessly.  
Each footstep takes our hearts,  
as we barefoot explore  
this summer meadow galore!

- Robert Lowell
