The brook flows
by the old mill
of rusting steel
whispering dreams
of water birds
and soft moss
hidden in shadows.

Here, where nothing
is untouched,
a blanket of silence
wraps the stones,
touches the leaves
with tenderness,
a reminder that all repose
is in the folds of its depths.


- Tadeusz Różewicz
