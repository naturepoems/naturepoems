The mountain
exhibits a stillness  
which escapes the eye,  
at least from the foot, 
on which walls of granite  
possess too much grace,  
no thunder,
opin’ their lips  
with silver ripples,  
that lunchtime laughter flies
when she rests,—  
from balconies of berries.  
The air  
moves like destiny.
