So we'll go no more a roving
So late into the night,
Though the heart be still as loving,
And the moon be still as bright.

For the sword outwears its sheath,
And the soul wears out its state;
And the heart must pause to breathe,
And love itself have weight.

We’ll go no more a roving,
A night breeze chills the eye;
Shall not these months dispelling
Bring peace unless we try?

So we’ll go no more a roving.
But serenity is nigh—
Love and passion abiding,
Combines a gentle sigh.

- Lord Byron
