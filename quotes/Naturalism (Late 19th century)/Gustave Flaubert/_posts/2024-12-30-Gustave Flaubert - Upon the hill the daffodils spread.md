Upon the hill, the daffodils spread,
Like golden laughter on the breeze,
And as the sun dips, paints the red,
The nightingale sings with such ease.
Each moment stolen from the day,
Turns to gold in twilight’s hand;
Where nature’s whispers softly play,
And leave us in eternal stand.


- Gustave Flaubert
