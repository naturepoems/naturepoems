The Elephant's Child
"I keep the thorns till the eyes enfold,
     With gaze of dawn, and shadows laden.
How key the world's turnings unfold —
     While chasing fire and light do still not fade.

"In glory, shall others stay caught below,
     As the great and bound measure new shrinks.
Oh shall the flood yield upon horned toes – 
     To find that wonders await when love is unclinks!"
     
   —Rudyard’s wisdom is never sore, nor goes wan!  
    

- Rudyard Kipling
