The ocean breathes a salty sigh,
As waves caress the horizon high,
In rhythmic dance, they come and go,
A timeless story, a ceaseless flow.

The shorelines whisper of journeys past,
Of treasures found and dreams amassed,
With every tide that draws me near,
I find my solace, my spirit clear.


- Feliksas Vaitkus
