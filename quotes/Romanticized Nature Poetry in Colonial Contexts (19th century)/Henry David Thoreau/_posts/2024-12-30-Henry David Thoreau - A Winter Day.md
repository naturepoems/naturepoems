A Winter Day
---

What a day for a stroll!  
Let us enjoy this primal hour,
As sunlit snow gives softest glow,  
No cowering creatures in this flower.

The trees stand like sentinels, wise,
Supporting each frosted weight they claim.
Nature stretches, yawnsâ€”then sighs,
In quietude, but not in shame.

---

Here, naked earth, stripped of its past,
Awaits the warmth and life anew,
While we revel in this moment, vast,
In winter's calm, with hearts so true.


- Henry David Thoreau
