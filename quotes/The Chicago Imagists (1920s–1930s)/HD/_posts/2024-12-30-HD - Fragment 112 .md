Fragment 112 

Earth feeds the wheat,
Corn breaks back from the green,
while the wheat, it grows in strength,
who bade us rise?
Only to keep the seed room warm,
wondering; 
does to thicken and lend,
the grain that goes full backward and forth,
though sun can burgeon,
while we sought and blocked the sun,
for it reached mystery through.
Let the door be a light to flower;
for as I show,
it cuts, it bears the heat;
