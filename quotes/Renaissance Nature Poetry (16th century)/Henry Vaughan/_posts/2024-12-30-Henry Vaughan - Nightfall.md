A still night beckons from the sky,  
Where stars, like thoughts, drift into view;  
In silence, all my cares nearby,  
Are whispered to the moon so true.

Each glitter shines like secret lore,  
And every breeze hums tenderly;  
In nature's hush, I crave for more,  
To merge my heart with night's decree.
