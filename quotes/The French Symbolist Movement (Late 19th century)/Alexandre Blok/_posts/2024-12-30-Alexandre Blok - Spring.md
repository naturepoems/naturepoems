Spring

The earth awakens in the morning light,
With dewdrop jewels, the grass is bright;
Blossoms bloom, fracturing the air,
With hues aflame, fragrances rare.

A chorus swells in the light of dawn,
As songbirds weave their timeless song;
Natureâ€™s hands touch the world anew,
In a gentle dance, ancient and true.

Oh, to be part of this sacred choir,
Where life rekindles its warm desire,
In spring's embrace, all hearts will mend,
Where beginnings whisper, and sorrows end.

- Alexandre Blok
