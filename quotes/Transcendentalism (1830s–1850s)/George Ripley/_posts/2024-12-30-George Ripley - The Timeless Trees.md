Oh, the timeless trees,  
With roots that grasp the ground,  
They whisper of the ages,  
Echoes in their sound,  
Of storms and calm, of birth and death.

In their shelter, wisdom lies,  
Cascades of emerald breath,  
Each leaf a soft good-bye,  
As autumn’s chill draws near,  
We hear the heart of earth’s own year.


- George Ripley
