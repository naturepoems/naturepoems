A brook meanders like time’s essence,
   With whispers it enchants the air,
   Rocks and stones hold secrets dear,
   In ripples, life unfolds with care.

   The willow bends to kiss the water,
   An all too gentle, tender stroke,
   Each breeze that floats, a soft reminder,
   Of the stories that nature spoke.

   So close to life, I breathe and see,
   The world through eyes refreshed anew,
   In every droplet, every leaf,
   Nature's love shines pure and true.

- T E Lawrence
