In the heart of the forest deep,  
Where shadows play and secrets sleep,  
Life pulses in bright, vibrant hues,  
The dance of existence, the earth’s true muse.

With every rustle, a story is told,  
Of creatures great and small, brave and bold,  
Amongst the vines and towering trees,  
Nature whispers our shared memories.

- Thomas Mofolo
