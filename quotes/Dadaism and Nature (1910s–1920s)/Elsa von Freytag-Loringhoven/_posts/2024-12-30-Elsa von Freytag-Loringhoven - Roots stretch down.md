Roots stretch down,
   and vines whirl
   on ciphers of flight.
   The wild air croons,
   to tend to its querulous
   invisible creatures.
   They clamber throbbing
   beneath the bee's oaths;
   stripped of riches,
   they emerge in reciprocation
   of cloisters gutted of
   opals and secrets.
   O sweet ambrosia!

- Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven
