Beneath the laden boughs of pine,
Where shadows shift and sunlight twines,
I pause and listen to the breeze,
That carries forth the birds and trees.

Each flicker of a leaf does sway,
A dancing tale of earth's ballet.
Nature's heart beat strong and true,
A symphony in every hue.


- Zora Neale Hurston
