The Idea of Order at Key West

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water, and the sky, and the stars,
The beauty of it all, that is when we hear
The voice of the song, a mingling of death
And life, a sound to which we cannot cling,
She is at peace, and the sea is still.
But there is no room for a soul to grow
In the blue silence of the ocean’s breeze,
It is as if the sun influences the world,
And beauty flows in the rhythm of the winds.

- Wallace Stevens
