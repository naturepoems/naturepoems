The River's Song

Through valleys deep and mountains high,  
a river flows, relentless and free,  
a melody sweet as the gentle sigh—  
a lullaby sung by the willows and bee.

With every bend, a new verse unfolds,  
as it carves through the earth’s hardy breast;  
secrets entwined in the water it holds,  
a journey imbued with nature’s best.

Here, by the banks, I pause to reflect,  
to listen to the stories of life as it streams;  
for in the river's flow lies connection and respect,  
a reminder that all are woven in dreams.

So let it guide me where the wild things roam,  
a gift from the heart of the land’s embrace—  
for the river's song is a journey home,  
a timeless treasure, full of grace.

- Johannes Semper
