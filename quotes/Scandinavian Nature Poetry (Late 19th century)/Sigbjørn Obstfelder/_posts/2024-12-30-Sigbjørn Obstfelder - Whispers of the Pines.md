The whispering pines sing an ancient song,
Their needles whisper secrets of lovers and loss;
Each breeze that passes carries a tale,
Of those who sought solace, no matter the cost.

As I walk through the forest, a gentle embrace,
I feel the heartbeat of earth in my soul;
In the hush of the trees, I find my own truth,
And in nature’s embrace, I find myself whole.

- Sigbjørn Obstfelder
