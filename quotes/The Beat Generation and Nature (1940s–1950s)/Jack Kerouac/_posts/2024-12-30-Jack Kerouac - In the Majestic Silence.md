In the Majestic Silence

I lay upon the grass,
under the grand oak,
the sky woven overhead,
a tapestry of clouds,
the weight of the world
slips away, 
just for a moment,
in the majestic silence
of nature.

Each blade of grass sings
a hymn unto the sun,
vibrations of life, 
a reminder,
we are meant to move,
not only through time,
but through every
green path made.

Let me dwell here
for an eternity,
in the soft shadows,
listening to crickets,
as they chirp a 
serenade of late
autumn nights.
