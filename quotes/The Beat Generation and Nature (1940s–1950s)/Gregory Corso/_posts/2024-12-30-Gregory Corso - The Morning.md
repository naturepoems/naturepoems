The Morning
by Gregory Corso

When the morning
clouds the earth
with a wetsuit sound
and the eyes
of an opera singer
stare at the silence
inside the sky.

When music swells
in the wind’s teeth,
when his breath
can tickle the branches,

we’ll rise like prisoners
feeling the ropes burn
on our ankles,

waiting for a shout,
for a crackling echo
that could send
our old bodies
spinning into boughs
and the wonder of this morning.

- Gregory Corso
