The Human Abstract

Pity would be no more,  
If we did not make somebody poor:  
And Mercy no more could be,  
If all were as happy as we;  
And mutual fear brings peace,  
'Till we get you get the things to cease.  

If all were happy, not intended,  
The world would then be quickly ended;  
With brothersâ€™ love would cease to be;  
For none would then have saved their tree.  

So let us brood on this:  
That misery is not a curse,  
While we make the enemy treat,  
That strong and growing human heat.


- William Blake
