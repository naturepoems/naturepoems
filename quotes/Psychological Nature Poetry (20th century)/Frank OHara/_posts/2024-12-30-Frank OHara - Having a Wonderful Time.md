Having a Wonderful Time
The day is soft
    and sounds in my ears
like all the plants
    are laughing,
  the white and pink,
purple blossoms splashing
    around,
     there are bluebirds
      soaring high,
                gently lapping
      against the skies
   in summer light.
I feel good now like the
    wind is intertwined
  among each limb
  and stretch that feeds
      the trees,
               this sun
          that stretches
me as I lean back,
          mellow as fruit,
  not a cloud even in the distance,
 a spark, a thrill,
yet still, there’s a beautiful silence
    when you close your eyes,
      floating in it.

— Frank O’Hara
