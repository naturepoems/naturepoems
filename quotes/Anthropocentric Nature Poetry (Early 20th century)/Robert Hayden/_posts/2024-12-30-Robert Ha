The Fish

The fish danced in the whirlarming currents,
Slowly through the glade and shadows,
As legends untold burst into rings of ideas
Brighter than stamens in the light of dusk.

There, confronting waters as they returned—
My eyes longed to see each fin’s flickered grace
Amid the emerald strands of lush vibration
Pulling me deeper into the world of settling.

In order to consciously restore cycles,
I learned the whispers of soft tides’ intent
Battening under the nights of all oceans,
The silvered flickers that traded the stifling cold.

Beyond, in reverie, we crescendoed beauty,
The waters muted fluid astonishment,
And an all-encompassing sense of solace,
While the fish, in musing contortions, swam on.
