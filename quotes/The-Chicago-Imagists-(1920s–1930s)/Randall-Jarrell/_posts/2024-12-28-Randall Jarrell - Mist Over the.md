Mist Over the Mountains
    In clouds sighing together,
    The last light shines,
    Night descends, and spread wide,
    Its damp shadow mixture low.

    The hills, painted in silence,
    Waken—all along the infinite road,
    As the mist clears away,
    Stars shine through crystalline darkness.

- Randall Jarrell
