The mountains rise in majesty tall,
Cloaked in shadows, they answer the call;
Of winds that echo their tales of old,
In whispers that turn the air to gold.


From heights so grand, the valleys sing,
In harmony with the breath of spring;
In their embrace, I lose my way,
As natureâ€™s pulse beckons me to stay.

- James Joyce
