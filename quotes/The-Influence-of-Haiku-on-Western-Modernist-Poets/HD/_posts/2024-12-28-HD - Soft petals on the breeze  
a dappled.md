quote: "Soft petals on the breeze,  
a dappled dance of color,  
light filters through the branches,  
painting shadows in my heart.  
I reach for the blossom  
and offer a wish to the sky,  
a moment caught in beauty."

Soft petals on the breeze,  
a dappled dance of color,  
light filters through the branches,  
painting shadows in my heart.  
I reach for the blossom  
and offer a wish to the sky,  
a moment caught in beauty.
