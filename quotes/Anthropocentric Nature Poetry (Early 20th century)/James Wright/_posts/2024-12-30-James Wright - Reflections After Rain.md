After rain, the world transforms—
A canvas washed anew, colors brighter,
I walk amidst the vibrant greens,
Each blade of grass a testament
To the earth’s quiet resilience,
While rivers swell, bubbling with laughter,
Carving their tales through rocky landscapes.
Listen! The trees join in chorus
Celebrating life in its delicate shades,
And I, a humble witness, sink deeper, then,
Into the truth of my own small existence,
Finding beauty in this fleeting moment,
Grateful for the air I inhale.

— "Reflections After Rain"
