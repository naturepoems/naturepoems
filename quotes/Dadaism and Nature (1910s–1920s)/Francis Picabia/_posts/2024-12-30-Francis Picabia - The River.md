The River
The river flows, a silver whisper
through the heart of the city,
a book of songs written on water.

Above, the sky is a canvas
brushed with strokes of light;
the clouds dance, flirt, then fade,
a nature's play in constant motion.

We understand nothing,
only the ripples of silence,
only the giggles of trees
as they beckon the breeze with laughter.

- Francis Picabia
