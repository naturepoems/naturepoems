The mountains rise, stoic and grand,
Ancient giants claw the sky,
Carved by time’s relentless hand,
Where eagles dare and rivers cry.

Snowcaps gleam in the sun's embrace,
As clouds swirl like thoughts in flight,
Here in silence, truth finds space,
In nature’s wild, fierce delight.

Each peak a testament to the ages,
Guardians of the stories untold,
In their shadow, life blossoms,
The heart of earth brave and bold.

- Julian Tuwim
