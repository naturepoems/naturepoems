Nature's Song

In darkest eve beneath the veil, 
The echoes whisper, tales prevail; 
Where every creature finds its note, 
In timeless song, our hearts devote.

From winds that dance in fields of gold, 
To waters deep, and mountains bold, 
In every rustle, every breeze, 
Nature's rhythm seeks to please.

So let us tread where silence speaks, 
And carry forth what nature seeks; 
In harmony, our souls align, 
With nature’s song, we intertwine.

- James Elroy Flecker
