quote: "In the heart of the forest, the shadows play  
The sunbeams trickle through thick canopies  
Life teems in each corner, from roots to the skies  
A tapestry woven by the hands of the wild."

In the heart of the forest, the shadows play  
The sunbeams trickle through thick canopies  
Life teems in each corner, from roots to the skies  
A tapestry woven by the hands of the wild.

- Blaise Cendrars
