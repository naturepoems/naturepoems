In the dusky hush before night,  
fireflies break the veil of twilight,  
flashing moments of magic  
that pulse like tiny stars.  
The air is thick with mystery,  
as the world falls asleep,  
a blanket of stillness  
wrapped â€˜round the tired trees.  
Insects serenade the dance  
of dusk, a hum of life  
that tumbles softly,  
into the arms of night.  
Breathe deep this fragile peace,  
for tomorrow will awaken,  
a new day to greet,  
atach the sunlight to the sky.
