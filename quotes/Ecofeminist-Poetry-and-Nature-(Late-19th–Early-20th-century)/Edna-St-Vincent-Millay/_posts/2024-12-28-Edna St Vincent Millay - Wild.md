Wild State

The woods are full of whirling leaves,
That mock the earth in silver fleets,
And the haunts of madded foundlings cry,
From the edge beyond the beaten streets.

And here a hush of loveliness
Floats overhead with springtime’s breath;
While the nightingale, in weary ease,
Falls with the moon, awake at night at death.

O wild state, from the city spheres,
To removing grace gives me delight!
Enfold me with thy peace, O wild! 
For I am come to savor the slight.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
