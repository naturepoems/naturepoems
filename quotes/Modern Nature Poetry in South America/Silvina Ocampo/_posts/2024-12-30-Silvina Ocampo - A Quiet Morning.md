A Quiet Morning

Every drop of dew
a crystal teardropâ€”a pause,
a note in rivulets,
as tranquil as sleep.
In this quiet morning,
a bird sings far away
on a quiet branch,
it is a prayer of air.
Stillness lengthens time,
a memory composed
while the earth breathes,
every shadow falls gently
to meet the sun's warm mind.
