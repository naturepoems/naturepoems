The Flower's Song  
Each bloom tells a secret,  
a tale of its own,  
in the garden of wonders,  
a beauty well known.  
Petals of velvet,  
colors so bright, 
unraveling stories  
of day turning night.  
Oh, whispering flower,  
share your sweet hymn, 
in nature's embrace,  
as the light starts to dim.

- Carl Robert Jakobson
