The Flight of Birds

Look at them,
white wings spreading,
searching for the morning clouds.
They dance across horizons
like painted dreams,
often lost,
often found.

Listen,
each cry a promise,
a call from the heart,
dancing on the breath of the breeze,
it carries the weight of the world,
fragile yet majestic,
the song of life at  dawn.

Through the day,
they weave our memories
and lift our thoughts,
going from land to sea,
they touch us,
reminding us,
that freedom is a song
sung under the vastness
of the ever-changing sky.

- Bertolt Brecht
