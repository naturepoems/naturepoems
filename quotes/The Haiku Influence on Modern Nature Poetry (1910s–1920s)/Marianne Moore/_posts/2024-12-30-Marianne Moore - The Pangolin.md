The Pangolin

The angle of repose
is just another way to say
"rest—the way it hides,"
yet remains symbolic,
the coat of armor,
walks like a bottleneck,
yet folded sheets of earth,
bagged in a twist,
as it scans, like scales,
another pressing day,
once it was a native,
but now a paler shade,
desperate to search instead,
wandering close in thirst:
we hope for more,
the way it swallows,
all this is simply a hinge;

- Marianne Moore
