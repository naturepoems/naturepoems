In the silence of autumn, when the leaves turn to gold,  
an echo of change through the pathways of old.  
The crisp air brings whispers of winter’s embrace,  
while the landscape transforms, in a delicate grace.

With each leaf that tumbles, stories unfold,  
as the quiet of evening wraps the world in a hold.  
In this fleeting season, a moment to cherish,  
as the beauty of life in its splendor won’t perish.

- Émile Zola
