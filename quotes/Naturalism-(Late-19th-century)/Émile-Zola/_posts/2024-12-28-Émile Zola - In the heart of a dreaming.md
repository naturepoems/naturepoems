In the heart of a dreaming glade,
Where sunlight filters through the trees;
The world fades, troubles allayed,
In nature's arms, my spirit flees.

Cradled by the earth’s soft hand,
Each moment a breath of pure delight;
In this sacred, untouched land,
I find my truth beneath the light.

- Émile Zola
