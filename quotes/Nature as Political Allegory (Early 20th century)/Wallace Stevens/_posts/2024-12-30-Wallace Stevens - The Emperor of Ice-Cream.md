The Emperor of Ice-Cream

Let be be finale of seem.
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.

Call the roller of big cigars,
The muscular one, and bid him whip
In kitchen cups concupiscent curds.

Let the man eat cake and the woman enjoy
Only the stir of the spoon.â€”
Here let it be smooth, let it shine.


- Wallace Stevens
