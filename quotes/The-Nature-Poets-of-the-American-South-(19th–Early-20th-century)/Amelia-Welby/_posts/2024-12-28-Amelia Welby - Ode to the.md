Ode to the River

Flow on, thou joy of the land,
Dancing with laughter through every bend,
In thy smooth and shimmering hand,
The stories of time and tides doth blend.

With banks adorned in emerald hue,
Thou cradles whispers of the past,
To journey forth in broader view,
In all thy beauty, bold and vast.

Thou art the thread through the quiet glade,
Where life’s sweet music ebbs and flows,
To thee, my heart finds refuge made,
As nature’s symphony ever grows.

- Amelia Welby
