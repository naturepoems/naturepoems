Winter's Embrace
 
When winter cloaks the world in white,  
With crystal frost upon the trees,  
A silent beauty, pure and bright,  
Whispers softly in the breeze.  

Each flake a dance, a fleeting form,  
A chilly breath, a world subdued,  
Within the cold, the heart grows warm,  
In nature's stillness, peace renewed.

- Edward Burne-Jones
