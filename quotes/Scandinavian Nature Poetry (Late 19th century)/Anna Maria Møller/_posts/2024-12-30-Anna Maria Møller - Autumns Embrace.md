Autumn's Embrace

The leaves now dress in rust and gold,
Whispering stories, soft and old,
As they twirl down, a waltz of time,
In quiet grace, so sublime.

The chill in the air, a gentle sigh,
As nights grow long and days pass by,
Nature's canvas, brushed with care,
In every corner, beauty rare.

Embraced by the dusk, the world asleep,
In autumn's hold, the dreams run deep,
A season's end, a cycle’s grace,
In every heart, this sacred place.


- Anna Maria Møller
