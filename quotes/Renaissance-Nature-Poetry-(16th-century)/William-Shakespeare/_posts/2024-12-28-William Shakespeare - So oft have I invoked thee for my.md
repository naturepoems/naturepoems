---

So oft have I invoked thee for my muse
And found such fair assistance in my verse,
As every alien pen hath got my use,
And under thee their poesy disperse.
Thine own, the older, and much better, it is,
Worn, and like heaven-eating tradesmen's wear;
But things that like the wildest urge and cries
Are not the former droppings rent to spare.


- William Shakespeare
