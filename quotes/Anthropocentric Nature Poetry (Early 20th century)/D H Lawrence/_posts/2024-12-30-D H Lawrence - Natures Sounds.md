Nature's Sounds

The sounds of nature rise and blend,
In rhythms ancient as the earth,
The rustle of leaves,
The cry of distant birds,
Echoes of the stream,
As it dances over stones,
Creating a harmony
That envelops the soul.

Feel the pulse of the universe
In the gentle sigh of the trees,
In the laughter of the brook,
In the thrum of roots,
Digging deeper into the soil,
And I, just a fleeting breath,
One with this melody,
A note in the grand symphonic expanse.

In this music, I find solace,
As the world unfolds in whispers,
And memory weaves its tapestry
Into the rich fabric of life.

So let me linger here,
Among the sighs and songs of nature,
A moment caught in eternity's hands,
An echo of the divine.

- D H Lawrence
