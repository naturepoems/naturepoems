In quiet woods where secrets play,
 The rustling leaves, a soft ballet.
 A fox peeks from behind the tree,
 In nature’s realm, a sight to see.

 The morning’s breath, a cooling mist,
 The touch of earth we can’t resist,
 When every footstep finds its song,
 In nature’s arms, we all belong.


- Roger Fry
