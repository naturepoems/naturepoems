Amidst the fields where the wildflowers sway,
In the softness of dusk, I linger and play;
Each petal a promise, each bloom a chance,
Inviting the heart to a sacred dance.

The earth in its beauty unfolds with grace,
A canvas painted, a tranquil space;
In nature's cathedral, I find my song,
Where I truly belong, where I am strong.


- Henry James
