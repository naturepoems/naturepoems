Helen

All Greece
    depends on the
    seaâ€”over the
    dark blue, she
        brings her flowers,
red and white,
each hour,
    glorifying,
    her dress of gold.

A lift lifts you and
lavender breath
    unearths itself
when it
wakes and spins
    through the pale
cloud that holds
        the passage of the skein.

- HD Hilda Doolittle
