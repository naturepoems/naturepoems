I am a poet
I am a tulip
I am the bee
I am the tree
I am the water flowing
I am the sun
I am the roots projecting

I am beauty
I am the earth
I am celebration
I am a heart
I am the wind 
I am a yell in the quiet
I am the song in the wilderness

I am part of creation
Endless and high
I am you and your worries
I am the life beyond life
Every gesture
Is my poem
Every flower
Is my breath.


- Anne Waldman
