A twilight song fills the fading light,
Crickets sing as the day takes its bow;
The air is thick with the scent of jasmine,
On fragrant pathways under the stars.

Each breath a remembrance of nature's grace,
Each heartbeat a tribute to what has been;
In this tranquil moment, we find ourselves,
Wrapped in the arms of the earth and sky.

- Anna de Noailles
