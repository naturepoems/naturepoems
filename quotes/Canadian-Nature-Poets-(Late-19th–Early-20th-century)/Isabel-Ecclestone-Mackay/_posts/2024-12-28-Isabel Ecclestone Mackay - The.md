The Leaves

The leaves are rustling all about,  
With colors bright, they twirl and spin;  
Like whispers in a secret shout,  
They fall—a dance that won’t begin.  

In every shade, a story shows,  
Of summer's reign and autumn's breath;  
The hush of peace, as nature glows,  
In every leaf a whispered death.  

Yet life renews beneath the frost,  
And when spring knocks, they find their way;  
For every loss is but a cost  
To spring’s sweet promise, day by day.
