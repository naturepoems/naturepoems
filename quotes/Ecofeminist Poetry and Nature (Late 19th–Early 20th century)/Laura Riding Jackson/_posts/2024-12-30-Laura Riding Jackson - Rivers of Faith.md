Where the rivers carve their secrets,
Through the landscapes rich and bare,
Each curve tells the tales of time,
In the flow, I feel the air.

I stand upon the bridge of faith,
Letting currents guide my heart,
For in the dance of water and stone,
Nature gives me life, a fresh start.

- Laura Riding Jackson
