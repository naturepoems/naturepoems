A narrow Fellow in the Grass  
Occasionally rides;  
You may not see him in the Grass,  
But you know he's there,  

His notice seldom ceded involves the grass,  
And you feel your own feet,  
And it is a short distance before he leads.  

...If such that be,  
The Thing to see so different —  
Whistle among the detached weeds  
And you know  

That you see them too —and it was a narrow Fellow —  
So extend through all paths alongside,  
In the future,  
All his lonely kind.  
—Emily Dickinson
