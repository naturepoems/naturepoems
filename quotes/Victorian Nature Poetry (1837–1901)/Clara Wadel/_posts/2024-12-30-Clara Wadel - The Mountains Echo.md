The Mountain's Echo

From lofty peaks, the eagles soar,
As shadows stretch and daylight fades,
Each mountain whispers, ancient lore,
In craggy forms, history wades.

The air so thin, yet spirit strong,
Invites the brave to scale anew,
For where we climb, we right the wrong,
In nature’s arms, our fears subdued.

Atop the world, the view reveals,
A canvas vast, of dreams and dreams,
In solitude, the heart appeals,
The mountain’s echo softly beams.

- Clara Wadel
