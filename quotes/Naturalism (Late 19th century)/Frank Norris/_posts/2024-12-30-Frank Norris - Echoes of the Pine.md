Echoes of the Pine  
Listen to the pines, in their majesty stand,  
With the stories of ages held deep in their hands;  
Whispers carried on winds, through the branches they weave,  
A testament bold to the life they believe.
 
Through the storms they have thrived, with roots ever strong,  
In the dance of the seasons, where they all belong;  
Each needle a memory of sun, rain, and snow,  
A symbol of strength, in the ebb and the flow.
 
For the echoes of the pine remain steadfast and true,  
In the heart of the forest, they speak to you;  
And as you walk softly through their tranquil domain,  
Youâ€™ll find in their presence a love of the plain.

- Frank Norris
