ECHOES OF SPRING

Awake, O heart! The springtime is here,
With blossoms exploded o’er valley and glade;
The fragrance of life floats sweet in the air,
As nature arouses from winter's charade.

The rivers are rushing, as joy swells in song,
And the hills wear crowns of fresh emerald green;
With laughter of children, the world feels so young,
In the playground of life, where we’ve always been.

The birds are returning, with sweet melody,
They tuck in each note with a love so divine;
The trees stretch their limbs in a vibrant spree,
To bask in the sun that’s more precious than wine.

So let us rejoice as the season unfolds,
With dreams that await in the glow of the sun;
For spring is a magic that ever enfolds,
In the weave of the world, we are never alone.

- Thomas Bracken
