When the sky spills silver rain,  
The earth drinks in the gentle tears,  
A symphony of each refrain,  
Washes away all worldly fears.
  
And in that moment, life renews,  
With every drop, a blessing flows,  
In the embrace of nature's muse,  
The heart finds healing in her throes.


- Friedrich Hölderlin
