The Sea

O blue depths of the wavy sea,
                Where the heavens meet the land,
In the lull of the wild, I long to be,
                Where the surf brands my golden sand.

The foamy crest, the roaring tide,
                A dance of force and grace;
Where the mermaids play and the secrets hide,
                Lost in nature's red embrace.


- William Morris
