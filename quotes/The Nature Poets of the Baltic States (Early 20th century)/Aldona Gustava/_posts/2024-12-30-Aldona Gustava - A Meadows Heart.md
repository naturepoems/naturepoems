A Meadow's Heart
In fields of green where daisies sway,
A gentle breeze does play and twirl,
Colors burst in wild array,
The heart of nature starts to unfurl.

Beneath the sun, in open space,
The laughter of the insects rise,
A symphony of lifeâ€™s embrace,
Where every bloom is a soft surprise.

- Aldona Gustava
