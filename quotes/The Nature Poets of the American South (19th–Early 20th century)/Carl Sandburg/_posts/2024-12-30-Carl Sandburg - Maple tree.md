I love the look of the maple tree
In the spring when it is full of sap,
In the summer, when beneath its shade,
You can rest your heavy head,
And dream cool dreams.

I love the stars of a clear autumn night
Above the earth with faintest glimmer;
And when the wild blasts of winter blow,
I like to stand in the crisp, fresh snow,
And hear how the tree branches crackle and bend
As they yield to the giant gusts of wind.

- Carl Sandburg
