The Dry Season
Open your heart to the future's call,  
And let what tender tongues have pieced the screen  
Flow finally through the dwelling mindâ€”  
Remembering as shadows rise to shine;  
The dark can henceforth feed a world unknown,  
Split green at the temples and illuminate  
The night with whispers; restless through the void  
With filament waves on sails unshorn.  
As we're lifted in the cousins' flight,  
To drought and heartbeat intertwined,  
Let your thoughts cascade among these reeds,  
Dissolve the boundaries into rivers wide,  
And wander far beyond the garden tips,  
Where reeds may shiver, collecting dark-light dew.


- Richard Wilbur
