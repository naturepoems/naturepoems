In the waves of the ocean,
the heartbeat of the earth,
each crash a symphony,
a lullaby of salt and foam.

Seagulls dance overhead,
spirits of the sky,
a celebration of freedom,
a connection between worlds.

The tides pull us closer
or wash us away,
a constant reminder
of nature's will.

- Alejandra Zambra
