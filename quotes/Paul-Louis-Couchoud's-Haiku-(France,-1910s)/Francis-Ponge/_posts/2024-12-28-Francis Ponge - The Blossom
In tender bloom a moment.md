Petals open, revealing soft secrets,
The scent of new beginnings, a delicate brew,
In each tender touch, the essence of spring."

The Blossom
In tender bloom, a moment unveiled,
Petals open, revealing soft secrets,
The scent of new beginnings, a delicate brew,
In each tender touch, the essence of spring.

- Francis Ponge
