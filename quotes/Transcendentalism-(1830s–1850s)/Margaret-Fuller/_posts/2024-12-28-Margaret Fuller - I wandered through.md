I wandered through meadows
Enclosed in the dawn,
Where the dew kissed each blade,
And the silence was drawn.

Beneath the tall pines,
I found my repose,
In whispers of nature,
Where the sweet river flows.

The sun kissed my cheek,
With a warmth that I knew,
As the day stretched its arms,
In shades soft and true.

Oh, spirit of summer,
Embrace me this day,
In the stillness of nature,
Let my worries drift away.
— Margaret Fuller
