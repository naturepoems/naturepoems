The Imaginary Iceberg

The King's Cup is full of ice.
A bird will light here, then off again,
seeing earthquake rumble its stony memory.
Then only silence streams
from the lifetime of ice-floe,
reminding us solemnly that not a stone in sight.
Beneath the weight of this deep green swamp, an effort to float
or sway like a blown cloud passed night clouds still on ice.

I wish you were here,
often backward,
nimbly, from the ice, think,
the same pure emanation cloaked from a clean green field),
coming back above storing slowly before the external piece,

lies frozen. A corpse, waiting, is confronting me.  
Among the deep embayments loom untouched,
the polar winds on their thundering backs, and among the crags are solitary frenzy made.

I many times claim only a single lady but she is silent and grieved,
a light-hearted lady of icicles shattered before you squared ,
far above the places of deadly venturing smoke remain.
I can’t continue; I am indocile,. I have lost my grounding.
Reckon with me.

- Elizabeth Bishop
