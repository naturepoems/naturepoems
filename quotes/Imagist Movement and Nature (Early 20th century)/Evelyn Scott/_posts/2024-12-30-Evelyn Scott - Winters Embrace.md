Frosted mornings catch our breath,
Crystalled beauty over the earthâ€”
Where silence reigns, profound,
And the stillness deepens dreams.
Each crystal, a moment held tight,
In the grip of winter's chill,
Yet there lies promise,
Underneath the gleaming frost,
That spring will come again, in time.

- Evelyn Scott
