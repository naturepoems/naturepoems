quote: "The Dance
In the grove of the rainbow

I saw the leaping
ascending forms—

a shrub broke them apart

with blowing leaves,
while the sun of the brow

made answer outdoors

to a whistling geese.

So wonderfully riotous!

Each bound
with themselves—

arising outward
in that hum."

The Dance
In the grove of the rainbow

I saw the leaping
ascending forms—

a shrub broke them apart

with blowing leaves,
while the sun of the brow

made answer outdoors

to a whistling geese.

So wonderfully riotous!

Each bound
with themselves—

arising outward
in that hum.

- William Carlos Williams
