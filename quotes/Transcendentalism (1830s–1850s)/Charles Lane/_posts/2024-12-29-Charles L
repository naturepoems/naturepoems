The Beauty of Dusk

As sun dips low beyond the hills,
The sky ignites with vibrant thrills.
A canvas brushed in shades of pink,
In tranquil hues, our hearts can sink.

The twilight whispers secrets old,
In colors bright, they dare be bold.
A fleeting moment, soft and shy,
Where day departs, and dreams can fly.

And as the stars begin to gleam,
In dusky night, we drift, we dream.
For in this beauty, fleeting, vast,
The heart will hold—each moment’s cast.


- Charles Lane
