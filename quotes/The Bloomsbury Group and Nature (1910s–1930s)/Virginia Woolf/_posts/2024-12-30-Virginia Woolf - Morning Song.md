O radiant morning,
Fresh with dew,
Softly spread
Your fingers of light,
And awaken the world
From slumbering dreams.
The song of the lark
Comes weaving, delighting,
In melodies spun 
Across golden fields.
From your heart, the earth blooms;
Every petal, a prayer,
Every leaf, a dance,
In seasonal embrace,
Immortal as love.

— **Virginia Woolf, Morning Song**
