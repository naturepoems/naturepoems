The river flows with a steady grace,
Carving paths between rocks and dreams;
Underneath its shimmering surface,
Life moves—silent fish darting,
The heartbeats of creatures that hide away.
And I, walking along the bank,
See reflections of moments I’ve lost,
Casting away burdens as the water moves,
Then becoming one with the currents,
As each ripple joins the drift,
And the sun dances across the waves,
Holding my gaze as I find composure
In the rhythm of nature, ever flowing.

— "River Dance"
