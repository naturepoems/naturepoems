The Dance of the Earth

In the soft, shifting sands,
I dance with every grain,
Spiraling round the fire,
With shadows of wind,
As dawn wakes from dreams,
And slowly, we awaken
To the brush of natureâ€™s fingers,
Cradling time in her palm.
Let us gaze into the depths,
Feel the pulse of creation,
Each note strumming and vibrating,
In this eternal song,
Relishing in the spark of flashes,
Fingers of sunlight lying next to us,
The swirl of earth and air creating
A cacophony of whispers,
Where we belong.

- Gary Snyder
