In the grove, the silence  
Softens the morning's heat;
The fields show their light,  
The dark, steaming earth  
Clutches clouds.

I look at the sky,  
A cloud strays away from the flock.
Where do you go?  
Do you think, even clouds,
That I am not hair, but  
Dew in the night?  
You bare your figments  
Against the sun.

- Salvatore Quasimodo
