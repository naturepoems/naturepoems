A Summer Memory
  
A flickering glint from the sunlit leaves,
And a whispering sound as the boughs breathe—
A clear cadence drawn through each gentle way,
A balm of remembrance for each sunlit day.

Where the liquid light spills over the sward,
Each breath of green a welcome accord,
A silent ballad from earth’s dying note—
The summer’s pulse in each tender coat.

Sweet memory fills the young brow anew,
Awash with love, and a world that’s true,
In a simple caress of the summer sun—
These lingering moments, they live as one.  


- Thomas Wentworth Higginson
