The Clam
Beneath the waves of leisure, 
Where echoes sound in liquid plays,
The clam, in pearls of azure treasure,
Hides safely from the summerâ€™s blaze.

In lots of quiet, words unspent,
It listens as the tides reveal,
The charm of life in each descent,
While wisdom holds its unsealed appeal.

For all within the tranquil sand,
A world abides with no need for pride,
In sacred homes the dainty hand,
Forms memories, rich in truth and tide.

- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr
