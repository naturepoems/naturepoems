Reflections on a Pond  
 
Mirror of the sky so blue,  
Your surface, like a dream come true;  
Each ripple whispers secrets old,  
In stillness, life’s reflections unfold.  

The dragonfly skims o’er the glass,  
And I, enchanted, watch time pass;  
In nature’s peace, my heart will dwell,  
In every leaf, in every shell.

- William Henry Channing
