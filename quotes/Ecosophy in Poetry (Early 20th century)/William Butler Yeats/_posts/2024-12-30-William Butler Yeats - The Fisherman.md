The Fisherman
Although I have no gift of gab,
While fishing with a threadbare line
I often see the otters bob
Around their blackened linny tree,
Where they nest or water flows.

The grey hill shines beneath a cloud,
Where pastures are in pools of rain
And one bright dappled cow draws near;
O, lost among the reeds, in places slight,
And the smile of a maiden at twilight.

Around every rock in the bay
I, drawn beside streams, blast the pain
Using a dream of the wind.
And if lonely soft remedies lie,  
I will never return to tell the lie.

- William Butler Yeats
