Hibiscus

The red hibiscus, unfolding,
In the bright sunlight, its petals,
Like a flamboyant ice, fresh and bright,
Curving exquisitely at the edges,
It whispers of the calyx in tranquil, leafy repose,
Reflecting upon summer's verdant dream,
A tropical garden of earthly delights,
Where the winds strove in rampant colors.
Each bloom, a fluttering charm of allure.


- Marianne Moore
