author: Ezra Pound
quote: "In quiet woods where shadows sigh,  
   moss carpets the ancient stones,  
   a deer steps lightly, watching.
    
   Sunlight filters through the trees,  
   dappling the ground with golden hue,  
   life in harmony wrapped in breath."

In quiet woods where shadows sigh,  
   moss carpets the ancient stones,  
   a deer steps lightly, watching.
    
   Sunlight filters through the trees,  
   dappling the ground with golden hue,  
   life in harmony wrapped in breath.
