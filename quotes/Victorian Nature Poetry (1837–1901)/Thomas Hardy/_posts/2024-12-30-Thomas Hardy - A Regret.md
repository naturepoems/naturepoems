A Regret

I planned to live alone and free,
In the quiet of a reverie;
And little did I think that fate,
Would lead me, almost at Heaven's gate.

For soon I found my mind a maze,
Lost in so many passing days,
The snowdrops falling, the crocus bloom,
All in this dream of a distant room.

The whispers of the trees outside,
The brook at hand, it matched my pride;
Yet I go unthanked, for beneath this peace,
Comes a fault I cannot cease.

So onward pass these golden hours,
With skies above and hidden flowers,
But deep within, a shadowed sigh,
Burns brightly on that quiet lie.

- Thomas Hardy
