There is a Sleep
By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

There is a Sleep
Aye ! hug me,  Bright Face                        
"I sit alone in the golden light."
 In the stillness to which I am led;                       
The quiet magnificent sound of the brook, 
Pulsing though innumerable leaves, 
flowing down to the torrent nearby.
I am lightly wrapped,
In its soothing embrace,  
Lulled by dulcet whispers,  
And brightly washed, a grain of the seabed,
In undulation of tides.--  
Above, star-filled light 
 Awaits, wrapped in the glow.
 
Or is it, the comfort of the tempest, 
Awilling embrace born of winter’s quilt,
That shields the land once more-------
 I wander
Among the Mountain cove,  
In a world of pine and silence.
O, I am caught in nature’s net!  
This space unbound awakes, 
To dreams of earthly home.  

My soul in reverence does inhale,
The air where life is pure as heaven,
Flows through the veins.
In tranquility’s womb, I lie!
