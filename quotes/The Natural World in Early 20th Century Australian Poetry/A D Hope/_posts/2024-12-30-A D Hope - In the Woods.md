In the Woods
In the woods where shadows lean,  
And silence drapes the dreaming ground,  
The whisper of the night unseen,  
Resounds through leaves, a haunting sound.

Here lies the essence of the night,  
As branches weave both dream and tale,  
In moonlight's purvey of soft light,  
Their echoes rise and fall like sail.

Each rustle tells of silent grace,  
A promise sewn in earth's embrace,  
As spirits find their ancient place,  
To heal, to breathe, to drift, to trace.
