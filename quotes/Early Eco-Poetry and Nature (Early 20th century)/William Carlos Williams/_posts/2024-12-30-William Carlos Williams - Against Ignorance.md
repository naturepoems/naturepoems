Against Ignorance

O when will it be a

sadness that goes in,

from here to say,

a knowledge that says{

was rough to tear,

and fumed	to seeds or

tolier, it waits to know

on earth as everybody does, bless it,

and the air,sails,

The larger plants
to an end.

It waits in silence as my flower

as it tries,

Not simple this way,

That knows to winnow.

We really had time,

do not imagine,

across that growing any good.

O! what we have not and what
we shall not know!

Insist upon empty

and body,

our faces.

Let me go from the light,
clear brush of this decade,

to the wider fields,die.

- William Carlos Williams
