Spring

I cannot see why the forest should not be a paradise for us,
    And at night only the stars and the moon,
They can watch over us, and they can listen to us
    In peace, while we listen to the great ups and downs of trees,
    The brooding swan and the golden sunrise,
So I stand in the grass,
Up to my knees in flowers.

—Henry David Thoreau
