The ocean sprawls before me,
An expanse of endless blue,
Its waves crash against the shore,
A rhythm as old as time.

I stand on the rocky edge,
Feeling the spray kiss my face,
Each droplet a fragment of memory,
Carrying stories of the deep.

The gulls cry above,
Each call a distant echo,
And I am entranced,
By the dance of the tides,
A reminder of life’s ebb and flow.

- Richard Wright
