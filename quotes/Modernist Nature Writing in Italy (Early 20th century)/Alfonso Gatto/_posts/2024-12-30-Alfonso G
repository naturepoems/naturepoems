Just a few rays of sun,
I will say everything.
Gently the leaves burst,
parched now, full of unmade shadows.
The hill row gives
its bloom tomorrow,
the fields slowly part
and become a newly planted sky.

I know the wind;
it sweeps dust
from gardens and roads,
cradles the voices
more than the beginnings,
palms and splinters,
crosses over them.

The little bird's song,
naked, lasts,
a word worth snail shells, 
trees, violets in the sheaves, a poem
between the waters,
and voices that repetitively
unravel the brilliance of the stars.

- Alfonso Gatto
