The ancient woods, the frosty leaves decay,
On autumn's stage, where frail lamps gently die,
I pause awhile, and in the dark I lay,
Beneath the night that drapes the empty sky.

For quiet pays tribute to the soothing grove,
As flowers shed drifts of shadows to the ground,
A silence lingers softly in the alcove,
And the breath of night extends their sacred sound.

So in this instant, time no longer rings,
While lichen sows the peace within the wood,
And echoes softly toward the voice of springs,
I gather strength from each darkened ride of flood.

- John Keats
