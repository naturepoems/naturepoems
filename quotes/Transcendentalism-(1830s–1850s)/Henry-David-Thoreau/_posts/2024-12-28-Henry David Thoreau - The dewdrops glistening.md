The dewdrop’s glistening promise,
On the edge of dawn's first light—
A delicate gaze upon the world,
Opens the day anew;  
Each blade of grass alive, 
In its emerald attire,
Witness to the glory,
Of a fleeting moment,
Where nature calls my name,
And I blissfully wander,  
In gratitude for this sacred life.
Forever in harmony,  
With all that grows and breathes.

- Henry David Thoreau
