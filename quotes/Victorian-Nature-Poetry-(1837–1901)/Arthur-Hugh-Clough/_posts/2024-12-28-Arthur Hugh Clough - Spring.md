Spring Dawn

The dawn comes up with a golden ray,
   The dewdrops gleam in light;
The flowers awake to the warmth of day,
   The sun drives away the night.

The skies are blue, and the air is sweet,
   As birds in chorus sing;
All nature wakes to a world complete,
   And life is joy in spring.


- Arthur Hugh Clough
