The Forest  
  
  
The forest lies in verdant arms,  
Embraced by ferns and wildflowers fair,  
Where sunbeams drift through leafy crowns,  
And songbirds weave their music rare.  
  
Each path unfolds a secret tale,  
Of time and life and ancient lore;  
In every rooted tree, a story,  
A whisper from the earth's deep core.  
  
Here twilight falls like lace on leaves,  
And shadows dance on fallen ground,  
In that sweet hush, the forest breathes,  
In nature's heart, my soul is found.

- EJ Pratt
