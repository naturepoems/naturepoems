O things of beauty, pure and bright,
 With simple forms that bring delight!
 In every leaf, in every tree,
 I find the essence, wild and free.

 The sun's warm rays, the moon's soft glow,
 In every season's ebb and flow,
 Nature's art, without a guide,
 Opens her arms to all who bide.


- Roger Fry
