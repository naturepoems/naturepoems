The earth is full of regrets,

But the mountains stand so high,

To gaze on the ocean's wrinkled sets,

And hear the windling sigh.

The shadows grow and the sun descends  

To welcome twilightâ€™s knell,

While twilight fades, unfriends,

And the earth takes on its spell.

For here the winds entwine their sands,

In the secret paths we tread,

While nature's whispers with her hands

Are casting forth in love, not dread!

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
