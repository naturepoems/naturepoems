The Night
---

When the world takes on its quiet grace,
Under the moon’s soft whispering lace,
The stars align, a gentle quilt,
Across the hills where dreams are built.

Beneath the vast, unyielding dome,
In these woods, I find my home.
With every creature, whisper, sigh,
Underneath the night’s vast sky.

---

Let silence reign ‘til light shall break,
In the rustle of the leaves and the stillness awake.


- Henry David Thoreau
