I stood beneath the ancient oak,
And felt the rush of life around,
The whispering leaves, the vibrant croak,
Of frogs and birds, a joyful sound.
For nature sings its eternal song,
In every note, we all belong,  
And as the sun sets in the sky,
Know in your heart that you can fly.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
