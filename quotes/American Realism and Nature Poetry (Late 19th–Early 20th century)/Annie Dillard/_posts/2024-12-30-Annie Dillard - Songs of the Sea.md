The ocean, vast and mysterious,
Draws me to its shores.
Crashing waves, like symphonies,
Calling me home.
Every grain of sand,
Holds a story whispered.
The salt of the earth,
Reminds me to be humble,
To merge with the tides,
And flow with the currents, humbled by waves.

               – From "Songs of the Sea"

- Annie Dillard
