quote: "The garden is full of autumn, and the trees
Stand in the sunlight with their golden hair
Spilling from the boughs like riches to the ground;
Each leaf is a memory, a sunbeam caught.
The shadows dance among them, whispering low
Of time that changes all, yet leaves us here."

The garden is full of autumn, and the trees
Stand in the sunlight with their golden hair
Spilling from the boughs like riches to the ground;
Each leaf is a memory, a sunbeam caught.
The shadows dance among them, whispering low
Of time that changes all, yet leaves us here.

- Ezra Pound
