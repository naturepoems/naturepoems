The mountains rise in their ancient grace,  
Their shadows deep where the eagles soar;  
In this wild beauty, I find my place,  
And my spirit rejoices, forevermore.  

The streams run clear, and the trees stand tall,  
In the embrace of nature, I feel renewed;  
In the whispered silence, I hear the call,  
Of the earth's soft heartbeat, in solitude.

- Ruth Dallas
