Autumn Begins in Martin’s Ferry, Ohio
In the shivering, yellow of the evening,  
I take my son’s hand and walk  
To the edge of the river.
The leaves brush against the water,  
A sound of the immortal dance  
Rising in the twilight.
When the darkness settles,  
The fish return to their shadows,  
And I can feel  
My soul slipping into the space  
Left among the leaves.
