The Man with the Blue Guitar

I
The man bent over his guitar,
  A shearsman of sorts.
The day was green.
  No one had thought about the land
And the sight of his blue guitar
  Seemed to be nothing but the call of a tune.

 II
In the recent world
  What season does value upon the guitar gravitate?
The wind and the tree seem to implore
  Him to leave at once.
They shake their heads.

 III
The people say
  That he should not be standing there
Not among leaves and boughs
  To play his music in the cold air
Of the autumn hue.


- Wallace Stevens
