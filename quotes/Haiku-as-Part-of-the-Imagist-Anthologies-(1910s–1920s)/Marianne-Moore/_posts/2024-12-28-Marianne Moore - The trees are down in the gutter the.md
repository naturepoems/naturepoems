quote: "The trees are down in the gutter, the gutters are full of leaves. 
In the yellow light of autumn, praise the wind, not the sun.
The air was so clear the sky faded. 
Did you see the distance? 
The dreams: 
They are the pattern of the world, 
In rooms with no windows, 
The beauty of the emptied in everything."

The trees are down in the gutter, the gutters are full of leaves. 
In the yellow light of autumn, praise the wind, not the sun.
The air was so clear the sky faded. 
Did you see the distance? 
The dreams: 
They are the pattern of the world, 
In rooms with no windows, 
The beauty of the emptied in everything.

- Marianne Moore
