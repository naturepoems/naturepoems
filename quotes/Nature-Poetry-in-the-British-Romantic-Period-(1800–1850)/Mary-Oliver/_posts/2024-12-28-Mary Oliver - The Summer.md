The Summer Day
I don’t know exactly what a prayer is.
I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down
into the grass, how to kneel in the grass,
how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll
through the fields, which is what I have been doing all day.
Tell me, what else should I have done? Doesn’t everything die at last,
and too soon? Tell me, what is it you plan to do
with your one wild and precious life?

- Mary Oliver
