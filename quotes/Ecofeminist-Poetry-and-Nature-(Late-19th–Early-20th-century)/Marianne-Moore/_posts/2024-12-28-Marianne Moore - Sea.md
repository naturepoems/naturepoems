Sea Grapes

What can they do, these blunt grapes
laughing with salt? 
I would rather float grains of sand,
or have sonorous arms shaking under
its predilection, rocks beneath our feet—
marking a difference, without weight,
expressing burden’s hum.  
To greet these sodden ripples,
it is enough to admire. The sea,
accumulating frictions, it pulls back,
yet we stand benign above. 
What is alive—what can invade—a sea grape,
said to hang and dry. Thus laughter 
may suffice, for nature gives us warmth;
to let them taste the fringe, then go—the day. 


- Marianne Moore
