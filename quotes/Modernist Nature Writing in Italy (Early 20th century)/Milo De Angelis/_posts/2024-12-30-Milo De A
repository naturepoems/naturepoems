In autumn's embrace,
a tapestry of change,
each leaf a story,
a fiery charm yet poignant. 
As the world prepares to sleep,
we, too, gather thoughts,
revel in the harvest
of memory, of love, and loss,
a reminder of the circle,
where seasons blend,
we find beauty amid farewells,
a solace in the quiet, rich with promise.

â€“ From "The Autumn"

- Milo De Angelis
