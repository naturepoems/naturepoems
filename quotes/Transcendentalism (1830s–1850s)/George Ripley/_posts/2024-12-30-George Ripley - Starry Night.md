When the stars come out to play,  
In the velvet blanket night,  
They sprinkle silver dust,  
Guide our wandering hearts,  
Home to where the spirit thrives.

The moon unfolds her glow,  
Casting shadows long and deep,  
In this celestial dance,  
We find the truths we seek,  
Among the cosmos' silent grace.


- George Ripley
