There's beauty in the quiet wood,
   There's beauty in the azure sky;
There's beauty in the gentle flood,
   That glides and laughs with joyful cry.

I love the sound of rustling leaves,
   I love the flowers in their bloom;
With Nature's beauty my soul cleaves,
   In deserts bright—a hidden room.

- Adelaide Anne Procter
