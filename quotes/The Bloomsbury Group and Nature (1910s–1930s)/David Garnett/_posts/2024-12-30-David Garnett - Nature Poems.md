Ode to the Nightingale
My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
But being too happy in thine happiness,—
That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees
In some melodious plot
Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,
Singest of summer in full-throated ease.


At Evening
The evening sun is setting Past the purple hills,
Scattering its golden light And whispering soft thrills.
The birds are singing the day’s goodbye,
While the crickets serenade the sky.
The gentle breeze stirs the leaves,
With rustling whispers, it weaves.
Nature holds her breath for a while,
As the dusk settles in with a smile.


The River
The river winds as a wandering soul,
Through valleys deep and hills of green,
Whispers secrets of ages old,
In reflections of silver sheen.
Through the heather and birch it glides,
A merry dance, a gentle sweep,
Where the soul finds hope and bides,
In every nook it’s deep.


The Garden
In the silence of the garden wild,
Where roses bloom and the leaves are piled,
A symphony of colors dance,
And in that moment, life takes a chance.
Nature’s canvas, so warm and bright,
Whispers dreams in the soft moonlight,
The fragrance of blossoms fills the air,
While time seems to linger, no need for a care.


Spring’s Awakening
Awake! The winter’s frost has fled,
The crocus peeks from its snowy bed,
Daffodils trumpet, a golden cheer,
Spring blooms forth, the season of the year.
A symphony from earth to sky,
With colors that make the heart sigh,
Nature rejoices, the earth’s sweet breath,
In flower’s embrace, we conquer death.


Summer’s End
The bees are humming their final tune,
As summer wanes, beneath the moon,
With a sigh the flowers droop and bow,
In the quietude, I ponder now.
The sun dips low, casting shadows long,
In this twilight hush, nature sings her song,
And in the ending, a beauty rare,
In every breath, in every care.


Autumn’s Call
When the leaves blush in fiery hues,
And harvest fields wear golden views,
Autumn whispers with a gentle breath,
A promise of rest, a dance with death.
The pumpkins glow in the fading light,
As nature prepares for the coming night,
Each sunset a farewell, yet a bridge,
To winter’s embrace, across the ridge.


Winter’s Song
In the stillness of a snowy night,
The world transforms in purest white,
Each flake a whisper from the skies,
With every breath, a soft lullaby.
The trees stand tall, their branches bare,
Yet in their stillness, a beauty rare,
In quiet moments, we find the song,
Of winter’s heart, where we belong.


The Dawn
With the first light of breaking morn,
The world awakens, renewed and reborn,
Birds sing sweetly, a joyful refrain,
In the soft light, we are free from pain.
Warmth kisses the dew-laden grass,
Hope stirs within as the moments pass,
In every sunrise, life begins anew,
In nature’s embrace, our spirits flew.


Nature’s Embrace
In the arms of woodlands deep,
Where echoes of the forest sleep,
Gentle whispers ride the breeze,
Nature cradles, the heart appease.
The flowers bloom in wild array,
And light dances in perfect sway,
In every corner, life unfolds,
In nature’s arms, we find our holds.


The Stars
At night when the shadows play,
The stars awake to light the way,
They shimmer in the velvet skies,
Reflecting dreams in lovers’ eyes.
A cosmic dance, eternal flight,
In their glow, we find our right,
Nature whispers through the night,
In starlit paths, our heart takes flight.


The Earth
In the fabric of the earth we seek,
Where mountains rise and rivers speak,
The stories of time, of love and loss,
In nature’s cradle, we find our gloss.
From the tiniest seed to the mightiest tree,
A testament to life, a symphony,
In every corner, life intertwined,
In nature’s sketch, our truths defined.


The Wind
The wind carries tales from afar,
Whispers of love, echoes of war,
In its embrace, secrets unfold,
The stories of life, both brave and bold.
It dances through branches, it sings through the leaves,
An adventure calls, for those who believe,
Let your heart wander with the breeze,
In the freedom of nature, find your ease.

- David Garnett
