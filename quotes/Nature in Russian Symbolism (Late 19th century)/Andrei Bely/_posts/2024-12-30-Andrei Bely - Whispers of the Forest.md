In shadows cast by ancient trees, 
The spirit of the forest breathes.
A symphony of rustling leaves, 
Where nature’s heart entwines and weaves.

The deer pass softly, unseen, unheard, 
While hidden worlds abound with herds.
And in this silence, life’s chord stirred, 
A melody of whispers, softly blurred.

Through tangled roots and wildflower fields, 
The essence of the wild yields,
A pure expression, truth reveals, 
In nature's realm, my spirit heals.

- Andrei Bely
