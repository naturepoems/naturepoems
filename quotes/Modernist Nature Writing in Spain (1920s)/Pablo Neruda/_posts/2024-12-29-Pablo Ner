The Song of the Trees

The trees whisper in shadow
a tale of the forest,
a clear echo of roots rising,
a song of life seemingly lost,
yet beneath the soil,
thereâ€™s a heartbeat tiny,
a pulse of existence,
knowing its path.

Leaves burst with green,
each hymn a resonating comfort,
where the sun holds my heart
going, going,
a dance of breaths,
a union in the vale,
nothing walls us apart,
our echo remains tied with light.
