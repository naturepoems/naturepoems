The Swan

And yet, O strange bird, beautiful and foreign,
You who have found a haven in my soul,
You who, but yesterday, from one sad place,
Rose beneath the leaden skies, alone and pale.

Your wings weary of labor in the wind,
Rest in the float that glimmers dimly,
In the distance embrace on your smooth horizon,
Where the green waters weave their long retreat.


- Charles Baudelaire
