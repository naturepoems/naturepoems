The Outback

Endless horizons, where the earth meets sky,  
Golden dust devils twist and fly;  
In the outbackâ€™s arms, this land of emu and deer,  
Each sunrise ignites a wonder held dear.  

Eucalypts standing tall, rugged and free,  
Where kangaroos leap, and the wild bird sings;  
Rivers meander through ancient terrain,  
As echoes resound of the thunderous rain.  

Here is a beauty both fierce and grand,  
A testament to time, carved by hand;  
So let us cherish this wild, open place,  
For in the heart of the outback we find our grace.

- E J Brady
