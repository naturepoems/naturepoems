The Thought-Fox

I

I imagine this midnight moment’s forest:
Something else is alive
Beside the clock’s loneliness,
And this blank page where my fingers move.
Through the window I see no star:
Something more near
Though deeper within the flowing, is:
In me.

II

The fox’s treading soft on the snow.
It is a kind of entrance,
Into the conscious dark.
A flash of an agile shoulder,
And he turns, his eyes full
Of the dark brilliance of a thought,
Other still.

III

I can see him breathe, the fox,
Like an ember, warming my thoughts,
Firing my wild imaginations
With a hunger upheaval,
As intricate as the mind itself. 
To know this fox…
And let the story unfold.

- Ted Hughes
