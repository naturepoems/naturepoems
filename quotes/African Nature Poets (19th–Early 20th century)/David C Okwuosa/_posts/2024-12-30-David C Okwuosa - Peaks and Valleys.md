Peaks and Valleys

In the peaks so high, the view is grand,
While valleys cradle, a warming hand,
Nature’s canvas, both vast and near,
Each moment a treasure, crystal clear.

Together they sing in the land of the free,
In harmony’s tune, a perfect decree,
In the dance of life, both rise and fall,
Nature’s embrace, a love for all.

- David C Okwuosa
