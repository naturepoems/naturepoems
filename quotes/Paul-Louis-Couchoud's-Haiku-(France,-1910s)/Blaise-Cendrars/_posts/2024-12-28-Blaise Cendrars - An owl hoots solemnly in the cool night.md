Its gaze piercing, searching for hidden truths  
The moon hangs low, a guardian of dreams  
The forest slumbers in a tranquil embrace."

An owl hoots solemnly in the cool night air  
Its gaze piercing, searching for hidden truths  
The moon hangs low, a guardian of dreams  
The forest slumbers in a tranquil embrace.

- Blaise Cendrars
