The Change

In the gardens of the city,
    change is inevitable,
The flowers bloom before the frost,
   and all are bright and alive,
The trees morph and grow,
   a little green on the brown trunks,
I stare into the distance
   as the day goes, dawn to dusk,
    
And the fighting of our lives fades,
   all that matters,
    all that truly counts.
