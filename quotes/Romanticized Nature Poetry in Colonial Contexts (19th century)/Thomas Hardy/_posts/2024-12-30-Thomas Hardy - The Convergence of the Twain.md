The Convergence of the Twain

In a solitude of the sea deep hearts are drowned,
While in foam-touched shores and restless tides flow bloom,
Among the hands of change a pureness may sound,
And in the dark there gathered joy in womb.

Borne far within reptilian widths where tongues are frail,
The music of love sealing and unhallowed laidâ€”
Where beauty doth now stalk on glimmering of pale!

- Thomas Hardy
