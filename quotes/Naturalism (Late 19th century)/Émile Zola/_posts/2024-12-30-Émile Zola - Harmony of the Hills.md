As I wander the hills where the wild roses grow,  
under skies painted azure, beneath soft winds that blow,  
I find solace deep in this wondrous embrace,  
for in nature's vast arms lies a tranquil grace.

The mountains stand stoic, their majesty clear,  
while valleys below sing of hope, free of fear.  
With each step I take on this well-trodden land,  
I am one with the earth, together we stand.

- Émile Zola
