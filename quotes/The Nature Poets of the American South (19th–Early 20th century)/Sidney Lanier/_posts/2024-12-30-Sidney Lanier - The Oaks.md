The Oaks
O, mighty oaks rooted deep in age,
  Your emerald crowns rise proud and bold;
Your leaves weave tales upon the stage,
  Of sister-songs well cherished, told.

With branches wide that shade the ground,
  Your whispers echo of the past,
In silent grace where wisdom’s found,
  You stand with strength that’s unsurpassed.

- Sidney Lanier
