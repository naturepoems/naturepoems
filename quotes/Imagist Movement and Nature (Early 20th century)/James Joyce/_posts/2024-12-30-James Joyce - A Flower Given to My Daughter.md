A flower given to my daughter
A small white flower, a small white hand,
nestling in a listening darkness,
A silence of trees, the tender
moaning of bells, I seek, I seek,
a thrill of lightness.

Green leaves overhead,
mellowing lights of orange,
spring forgotten, summer perished,
a lighted shield, a bright summer,
A flower in my daughter’s hand,
A smile to leave her.

O small white flower
given to my daughter,
Fair summer, faery lights,
a moment wakened to life.

Now that they come around,
the dominant forces,
a reasoning such as it is,
Tremendous life, all life laid bare,
a breath of  Air,
a bright sea before us.

Oh my daughter, oh my flower,
I see you stream down,
a bridge, sparkling blue, a curtain͏a flame
O flower of the morning, 
yearning gracefulness.
A child’s voice calling...
utforever....


- James Joyce
