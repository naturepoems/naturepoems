The Old People
In the bush as we remember
We stood and looked across the field 

The sun was sinking toward the west,  
Under the waning light, 
And fading every moment in the sky,  
We watched the shadows creep,  
As twilight deepened in the trees, 
And night began to hover in the air.

What are the people we remember, 
Those that we knew so long ago?  
They rise like smoke into the sky,  
Yet linger still in memory,  
Like stars long fuge away, 
In a ghostly whirl of leaves.

Their voices, like the setting sun,  
Now lost, still sing a requiem,  
In that melancholy space we dreamed,  
Of those who dwelt in silence,  
Among the trees, the songs we sing,  
Fade like vapour in the wind.
