Oh! I could gaze for ever on the sea,
Eternally as quicksilver an aspect fair;
Upon its deep blue mirror glistening, free,
There lies the sun that clothed itself in air.

Let me behold its peace, and harvest up
The faint, sweet scents, and sounds that wane, as if,
With every wave they cast into the cup
Of silence—as if these were sent forth for me, a gift.

For nature needs no warmth to tell her worth—
O, may you still be bound within like rivers free:
The measure of the distant moon’s rebirth
Is more; and rightly enjoyed upon the sea.

And when the last soft light at last dies down
I hope my heart does slumber on—alone,
There, in the darkest blue, as in a crown,
Where glories dance—and I’ll no longer roam.

- Lord Byron
