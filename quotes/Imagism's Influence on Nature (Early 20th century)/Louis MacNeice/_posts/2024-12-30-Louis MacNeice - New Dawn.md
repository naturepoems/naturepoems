With the sun rising high, the new day beams,
The scythe cuts through the threads of dawn,
While the light splits shadows into dreams,
I walk the quiet path to carry on.

With each straw colored under the sun's watch,
New life awakens with the morning rays,
In sweet abandonment, my thoughts do touch,
A butterfly and the sweet grassy lays.


- Louis MacNeice
