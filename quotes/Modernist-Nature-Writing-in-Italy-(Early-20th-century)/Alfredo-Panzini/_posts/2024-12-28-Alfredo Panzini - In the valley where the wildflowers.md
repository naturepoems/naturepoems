In the valley where the wildflowers dance,
colors burst like laughter in the breeze,
a meadow stitched with nature’s glance,
a quilt of beauty that aims to please.
With every flutter, every sway,
youth returns in a sunlit race,
where moments linger, wild and gay,
a sacred tribute to nature’s grace.
