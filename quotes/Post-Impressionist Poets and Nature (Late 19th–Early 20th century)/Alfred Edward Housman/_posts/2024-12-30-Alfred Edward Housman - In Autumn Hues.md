O to have the woods once more,
In autumn hues, the leaves that soar,
The crunching sound beneath my feet,
In nature’s arms, my life is sweet.

Each branch and bough, a tale to tell,
Of summers passed, of winter’s well,
Yet in the cycle, no despair,
For life renews, in beauty rare.


- Alfred Edward Housman
