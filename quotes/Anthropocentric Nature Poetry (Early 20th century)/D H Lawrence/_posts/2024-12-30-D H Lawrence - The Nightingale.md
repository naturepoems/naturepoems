The Nightingale

O Nightingale, your voice is one
With the north wind, it floats and circles,'
And somewhere in the twilight
Takes form and hovers:
I can almost touch you, but only
Once you left the first childish harmony,
I am left alone in the storm.

O Nightingale, sing to me now,
The high embryonic notes
Of a tune that anticipates me;
Sing to me intimately, while I wait
Like some crude element shooting out
To some dim, eerily bright place.

Oh Nightingale, let the thread of your voice
Spool across the sky and make a web
Of something more than a wish,
So the wind of winter can set it alive,
And I can cradle my heart in your light.

- D H Lawrence
