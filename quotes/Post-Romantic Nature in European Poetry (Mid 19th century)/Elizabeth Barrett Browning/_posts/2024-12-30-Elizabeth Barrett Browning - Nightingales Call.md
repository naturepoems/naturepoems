Oh, the nightingale's tender lay
Echoes sweetly beneath the stars,
Where moonlight bathes the trees in sway,
And beauty dances from afar.
The fragrance of blossoms float
Upon the whispering breezes’ crest,
And nature wraps her cloak about
Each moment felt—divine and blessed.
A garden grows with every dream,
As night descends, a calming balm,
In pathways where the heavens gleam,
And earth enfolds the tranquil calm.
An ode to nature’s symphony,
In the silence, peace I find,
Within her arms, I wake and see
The heart of love and life entwined.


- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
