To Autumn  
O thou who passest thro’ our vallies in  
Thy chariot of the sun,  
And callest forth the sheaves of golden grain,  
Thy fruitful harvests and thy bounteous rain,  
Bid yesterday good-bye—thy work is done.  
Thy work is done, and we shall meet again  
In life’s long autumn dream, when the swift days  
Of summer are gone; and while the glad sun plays  
In the horizon where the shadows chase,  
Lay by thy scythe, and with a smile embrace  
Thy followers, and call them to your side.

- Leigh Hunt
