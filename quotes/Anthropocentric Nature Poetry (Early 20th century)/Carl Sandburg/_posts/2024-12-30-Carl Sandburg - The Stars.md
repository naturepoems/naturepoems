I wonder if the stars are made of a great
scattering of ashes.
Did you ever think of that?
Or if the high white cloud
isn't the dust of remote flower beds?

Ah, and everything that is,
What if it were just a prototype
that someone tried and gave up?
It seems to me,
there are not enough of us
who would have the answer,
not enough of us
who look far enough
into the night.

Bring your eyes to watch
and gaze into the dark.

- Carl Sandburg
