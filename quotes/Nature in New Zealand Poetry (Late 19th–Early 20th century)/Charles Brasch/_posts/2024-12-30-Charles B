Nature calls, a siren's song,  
where mountains touch the skies,  
at the place where eagles soar,  
with each wistful sigh.  
The rivers, silvered ribbons,  
aglow with nature’s hue,  
remind us of the beauty  
that exists in life so true.

And we wander through gardens,  
mystery all around,  
where blossoms bloom like secrets,  
awaiting to be found.  
Let us take a moment,  
and listen as we grow,  
for nature has a language  
that only hearts can know.
