Dawn at Sea
The dawn breaks soft over the waves,
A brush of light on the horizon,
Where the sea mirrors a blush,
And the day unfurls its wings,
The sun’s golden fingers glow,
As they stretch across the surface,
Gentle whispers in the morning breeze,
Carrying dreams that dance,
On the waters’ embrace—
A new beginning, a triumph of light.


- John Gould Fletcher
