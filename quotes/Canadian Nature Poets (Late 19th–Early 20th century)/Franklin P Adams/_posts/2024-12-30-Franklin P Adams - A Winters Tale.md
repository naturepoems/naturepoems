A Winter's Tale

When winter lays his icy hand
Upon the drear and frozen land,
And every tree is stiff and still,
The world seems wrapped in ghostly chill.

Yet in the silence, beauty reigns,
In glistening crystals on the plains,
And under snow, life doth persist,
In every flake, a dream exists.


- Franklin P Adams
