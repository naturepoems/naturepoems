Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird

I
Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.

II
I was of three minds,
Like a tree
In which there are three blackbirds.

III
The blackbird whistling
Or just after.

IV
He rode
Over Connecticut
In a glass boat.

V
The exclusively black
Of the legs of the blackbird,
Caressed in spring, becomes a lesser shadow.

VI
O thin men of Havanna,
The blackbird whistling
Or just after.

VII
Icicles of the afternoon
Were neither full nor empty.

VIII
I know noble accents
And lucid, inescapable rhythms;
But I know, too,
That the blackbird is involved
In what I know.

IX
When the blackbird flew out of sight,
It marked the edge
Of one of many circles.

X
At the sight of blackbirds
Flying on the sky,
Hesitating between the dark and the red of dawn,
A flock descends,
And that longing is to be contained in its resolution.

XI
Across the snowy expanses,
Beside sentiments and colors,
It condenses down to simplicity;
Among the blackbirds,
Faces like moths in the grove.

XII
The coiling wind rises,
Harshness becomes real;
Upon the brink of all, the blackbird sings.

XIII
There it is, there it is  
Black red, the sun embers afar,  
And there the full simplicity of the wild,  
The essence of freedom amidst this this place.

- Wallace Stevens
