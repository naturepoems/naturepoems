To the River
Thou flowing river, clear and bright,
What tales dost weave upon thy flight?
A mirror to the bending trees,
And gentle hills that catch the breeze.

Through valleys deep and meadows wide,
Thy voice is heard on evening's tide,
A serenade, so sweet and fair,
In nature's song, I'm held in prayer.

May I, like thee, find spirit free,
In every turn, another glee,
For as you rise, I long to soar,
In natureâ€™s heart forever more.

- Ben Jonson
