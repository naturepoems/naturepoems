Let me rest by the glade,  
Where the wildflowers sway,  
And the butterflies waltz,  
In this gentle ballet,  
A communion of life at play.

Each petal a soft embrace,  
A moment held in grace,  
Nature’s tender concern,  
In colors that forever burn,  
The canvas of the earth’s sweet face.


- George Ripley
