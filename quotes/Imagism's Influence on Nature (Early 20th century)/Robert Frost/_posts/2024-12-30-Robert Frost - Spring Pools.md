Spring Pools
These pools that, though in forests, still reflect
The total sky almost without defect,
And like the sky, are painted blue and gold,
And, in the sky, just after it is told,
By a thin layer of clouds that share the sun.

I cannot bear that only unwillingly
Might our earth put on blowzy summer, but time
Is all, and this is how it will quietly transform,
To place no palm against the air's warm face,
As full of light and shadow as the dayâ€”
And I will leave it there, returning from the sun.

Can I return and drag these beads of thought
Across my mind, and lose them all and yet,
Find again a single hope to hope too, and be
As good as once I did then, and deserve no more,
And sense a pair and a pair turned our way to share,
With everything I found, to utter words of all wisdom?

- Robert Frost
