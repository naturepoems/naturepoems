When autumn leaves begin to fall,
And colour paints the fading trees,
Nature, she answers every call,
In rustling hush between the breeze.

The gilded hues of gold and rust,
Dance lightly to the earth below,
A final show as if they must,
Before the winter's chilly glow.

So here I stand amidst the breeze,
And take in all the joy they bring,
For in this moment, time does freeze,
And nature gifts her wondrous spring!

- George Gordon Byron
