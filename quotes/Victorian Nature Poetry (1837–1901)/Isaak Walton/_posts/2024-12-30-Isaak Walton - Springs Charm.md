The charm of spring, rebirth anew,
  Awakens life from winter’s hold,
  With every bloom, dreams are pursued,
  In nature's arms, our hopes unfold.

So walk with me through meadows wide,
  Where laughter dances in the air,
  In every step, let joy reside,
  And through the fields, our spirits share.

- Isaak Walton
