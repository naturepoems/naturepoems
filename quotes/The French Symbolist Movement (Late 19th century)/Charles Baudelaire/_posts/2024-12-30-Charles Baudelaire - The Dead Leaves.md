The Dead Leaves

The long-dead leaves flutter, drift away,
The gales of sobriety hard upon their feet,
This season beckons strifeâ€™s unyielding sway.
Here, Nature joins us for undying sweets.

Alas, what a weary sigh floats upon the ground,
As down they drift to share the wretched core,
With icy breaths and fading beauty surround,
Our lazy lives styled in passionate adore.


- Charles Baudelaire
