The Swan

The black swan sails,
noble and firm, gliding across the water, 
a feather-like whip of wind  
that flows beneath her, profound, and endless. 
She takes her time; she teaches the stillness 
in the spread of landscapes—  
a muted grace, a reverent calmness— 
it speaks of what the river knows, 
what every bird has felt 
adrift on the whisper of twilight. 

Some rage but others hum—
stretch down; feel what the sun reflects, 
fill in the lines, sink deep into trance. 
And though the currents rise and swirl 
like spirited fingers pulling you down, 
let the river caress a heart like stone. 
Everything flows elegantly, 
you are part of what’s known—yg
a swan of longing,  
wrapped in the richness of soft foam. 
Hold on; every thread connects— 
you manage to be alive; 
you choose your song.


- Mary Oliver
