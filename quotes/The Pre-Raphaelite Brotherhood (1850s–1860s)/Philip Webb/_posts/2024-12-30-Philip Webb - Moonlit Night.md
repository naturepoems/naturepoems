Moonlit Night

In silver light, the night unfolds,
A tapestry of stories told;
Beneath the stars, the world aglow,
In dreams of night, the heart may flow.

With every branch and shadow cast,
The moonlight paints the moments past;
In whispered winds, a soft embrace,
In moonlit night, we find our place.

Let silence reign, let wonder speak,
In quietude, the soul we seek;
For in the night, the spirit sighs,
In nature's bless, the heart replies.


- Philip Webb
