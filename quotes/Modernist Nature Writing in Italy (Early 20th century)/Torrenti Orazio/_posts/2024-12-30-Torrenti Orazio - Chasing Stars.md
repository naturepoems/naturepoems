Chasing Stars

On a blanket of night, I lie still,
The cosmos stretches wide and deep,
Each star a dream, a hopeful wish,
In this vast expanse, I drift to sleep.

Constellations tell the tales of old,
Mythical journeys through time and space,
While comets whisper secrets untold,
In the embrace of infinite grace.

Here, under the celestial dome,
I chase the stars, my heart alight,
For in their glow, I find my home,
A spark of magic, a guiding light.

- Torrenti Orazio
