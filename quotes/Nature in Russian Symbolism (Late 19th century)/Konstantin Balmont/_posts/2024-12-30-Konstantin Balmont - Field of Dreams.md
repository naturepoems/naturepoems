Amidst the fields where wildflowers blossom,
  The morning breaks with golden rays,
  The world awakens in the silence,
  Of nature's soft and gentle plays.
  
  The sun and wind share secret whispers,
  The trees respond with rustling leaves,
  Each moment lingers, rich with promise,
  In beauty that no heart deceives.

- Konstantin Balmont
