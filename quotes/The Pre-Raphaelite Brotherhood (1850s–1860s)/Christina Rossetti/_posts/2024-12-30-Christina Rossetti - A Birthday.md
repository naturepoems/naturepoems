A Birthday
My heart is like a singing bird
That sings in the wild wood;
My heart is like an apple tree
That blooms with bright white flowers;
My heart is like a rainbow shell
That paddles in the sea:
My heart is gladder than all these
Because my love is come to me.

Raise me a dais of satin, and
of flannel, hold my head;
And if you love me, a lily flower.
My heart is like a speaking bird,
That sings in the wild wood,
My heart is like an apple tree
That blooms with bright white flowers.

- Christina Rossetti
