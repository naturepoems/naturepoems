author: Marianne Moore
quote: "A pond mirrors the sky above,
a perfect reflection, serene.
Lilies float, untouched, pristine,
a silent conversation with the stars below,
where night cradles the world in dark velvet,
a fleeting moment of quiet ecstasy."

A pond mirrors the sky above,
a perfect reflection, serene.
Lilies float, untouched, pristine,
a silent conversation with the stars below,
where night cradles the world in dark velvet,
a fleeting moment of quiet ecstasy.

- Marianne Moore
