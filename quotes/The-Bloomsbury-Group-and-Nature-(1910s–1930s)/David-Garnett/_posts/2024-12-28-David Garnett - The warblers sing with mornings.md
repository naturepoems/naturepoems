The warblers sing with morning’s rise,
A choir of joy unfurled;
Each note a droplet from the skies,
Brightening our waking world.

In woods where pathways twist and weave,
Life dances in the light,
Nature holds its breath for those who believe,
In wonder’s pure delight.

So take a moment, breathe it in,
Let nature weave its song,
For in the heart of every sin,
A place where we belong.

- David Garnett
