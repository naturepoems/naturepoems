The ocean stretches, vast and grand,
Its waves a rhythmic, boundless dance;
Pearl-white foam caresses the sand,
In a timeless, hypnotic trance.

Seagulls cry, their wings outstretched,
Soaring high on the winds of fate;
Nature’s canvas, perfect and etched,
Unfolds stories that wait—elate.

- Émile Zola
