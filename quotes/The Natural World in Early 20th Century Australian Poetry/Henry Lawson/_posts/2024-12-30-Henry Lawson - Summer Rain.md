Summer Rain

In the summer, soft and light,
Where the evening bends in gold,
Through the valleys, touch the night,
With the stories yet untold.

Gentle raindrops kiss the earth,
With a fragrance pure and sweet,
Bringing life to every birth,
Where the bloom and beauty meet.

In the warm and lazy glow,
Every heart begins to sing,
With the grace of flowers grow,
Summer rain does joyfully bring.

- Henry Lawson
