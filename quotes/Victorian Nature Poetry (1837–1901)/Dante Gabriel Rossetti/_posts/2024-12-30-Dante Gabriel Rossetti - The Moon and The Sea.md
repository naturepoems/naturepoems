The Moon and The Sea
Over the rippling green of sea,  
The moonlight shimmers like golden lace;  
While shadows dance like a sigh set free,  
In this placid night’s sweet embrace.

Oh, that nature’s murmurs may softly blend,  
With the tides enfolding night’s sweet caress;  
Where every dream and hope transcends,  
In a heart that strives for blessed rest.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
