The Wild Beasts


  Oh, talk to the wild beasts who bear —  
  To the moor — but wander forever;  
  Go trick-hunting with me, I swear  
  By the moonlight I watched—silent and clever;  
  With a sniff through the yielding air of  
  Soft secrets delivered in cries —  
  For the soft, bewitching hours that tear —  
  As a good scent through the dusk one dies —  
  As I watch through the mowing air 
  Of the deep shepherd’s noise and songs;  
  Smiled with yielding parts, large and keen —  
  Will you linger here — to night guide along?
