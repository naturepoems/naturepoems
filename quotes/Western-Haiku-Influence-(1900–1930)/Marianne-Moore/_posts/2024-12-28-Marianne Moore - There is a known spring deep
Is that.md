title: "Marianne Moore - There is a known spring deep
Is that"

author: Marianne Moore
quote: "There is a known spring, deep,
Is that cold spot, half in, half out—
Where the reeds remain, virtually
Housing thoughts for the finch's rest;—
Further down, the 'small white flake'
Advises warmth, an invitation."

There is a known spring, deep,
Is that cold spot, half in, half out—
Where the reeds remain, virtually
Housing thoughts for the finch's rest;—
Further down, the 'small white flake'
Advises warmth, an invitation.

- Marianne Moore
