Chicago

Hog Butcher for the World,
Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat,
Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler;
Stormy, husky, brawling,
City of the Big Shoulders:
They tell me you are wicked
And I believe them,
For I have seen your painted women
Under your gas lamps luring the farm boys,
And they tell me you are brutal
And I believe them,
For I have seen the gunman kill
And go free to all the city’s houses.
But they have not seen the faces of those
Who bring promise and life to come,
And they tell me you are the birthplace
Of the flowers in spring and the laughter
Of a girl waiting for the dawn.

- Carl Sandburg
