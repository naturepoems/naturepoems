When I see the evening skies,
And watch the clouds like waltzing dyes,
I feel the joy the night can give,
Among the stars, let beauty live.

For every leaf that falls in peace,
And every moment that might cease,
Is whispered soft by nature’s air,
A testament that life is fair.


- Alfred Edward Housman
