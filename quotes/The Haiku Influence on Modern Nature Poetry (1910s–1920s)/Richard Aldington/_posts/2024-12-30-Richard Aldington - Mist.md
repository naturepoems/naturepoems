As the fog swells o’er the valley,
The trees breathe in soft sighs, 
An owl calls in the dark, 
And all is still but the whispers,
And the dreams woven from the mist.

In this twilight hour,
All is lost in white and gray,
Yet here I find the world’s command,
Wrapped softly in night’s embrace,
Until the dawn will break anew.

- Richard Aldington
