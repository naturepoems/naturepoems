Hyperion
Deep in the woods, a wandering spirit goes,
In search of all the sons of magic’s flow;
Ready to capture what night bestows—
To sweep guys into the warmth of song’s glow.

Forever lost, they’ll find a world unshackled,
With the moon that moves in flight across the tree,
As wood and stone, they glimpse the joys unaltered,
Through the earth, nature sets their spirits free.

- John Keats
