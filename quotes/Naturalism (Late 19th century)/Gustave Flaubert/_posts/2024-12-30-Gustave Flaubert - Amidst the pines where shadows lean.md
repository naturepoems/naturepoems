Amidst the pines, where shadows lean,
The whispers of the wild do stir;
Each blade of grass, each autumn sheen,
Unfolds a tale beyond the blur.
The crest of hills, the flowing stream,
Reflect the world in colors bright;
In natureâ€™s grace, we lose the dream,
And find ourselves in pure delight.


- Gustave Flaubert
