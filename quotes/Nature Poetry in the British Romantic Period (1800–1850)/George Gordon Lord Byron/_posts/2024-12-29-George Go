The world is one, this truth to learn,
Where every flower blooms freely in its heart,
To know the song in nature softly burns,
When shadows lend their shades; and love imparts.

So step afield and venture forth—
Embrace the essence of lady’s grace,
And press upon the dews that gather forth,
To taste of life in nature's harsh embrace.

- George Gordon Lord Byron
