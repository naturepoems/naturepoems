Flame and Shadow
As I write, the night rolls on,
Underneath the vault above,
Where shadows dance upon the ground
And the stars weave dreams of love.
Each flicker holds its secrets vast,
Hidden in the night's soft veil,
A life anew, a whispered past,
Each moment, borne on wind's own trail.

- Amy Lowell
