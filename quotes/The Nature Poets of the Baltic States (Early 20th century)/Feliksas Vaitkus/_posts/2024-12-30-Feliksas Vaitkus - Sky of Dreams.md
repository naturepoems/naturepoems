Oh, mighty sky with clouds like dreams,
Your azure depths hold ancient themes,
Where birds take flight and hope is born,
Under your watch, the world adorns.

The sun dips low, a fiery blaze,
Painting the night in a warm haze,
Each star a promise, each moonlit glance,
A step into nature's endless dance.
