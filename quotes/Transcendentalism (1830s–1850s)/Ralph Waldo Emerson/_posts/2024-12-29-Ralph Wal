Seashells   
   
In a world of endless shores,  
   
The seashells lie in reach,  
   
Each one a story etched in time,  
   
Beyond the mind that’d teach.  
   
   
They rise with tides that come and go,  
   
In nature’s soft embrace,  
   
And I, in wandering whispers,  
   
Find reflections that retrace.  
   
   
In every swirl and every curl,  
   
There’s magic that abounds,  
   
For these shells, such weary souls,  
   
Keeper of the ocean’s sounds!  
   
  


- Ralph Waldo Emerson
