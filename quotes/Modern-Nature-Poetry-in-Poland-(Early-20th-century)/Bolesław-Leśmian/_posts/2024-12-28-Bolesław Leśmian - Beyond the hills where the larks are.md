Beyond the hills where the larks are born,
And meadows rustle with the tales of rain,
The sun paints colors on the golden corn,
Where time loses itself, and is never in vain.

The streams dance wildly, babbling softly low,
A melody woven with threads of the breeze,
Breath holds the air as the wild winds blow,
In a harmony sung by the swaying trees.


- Bolesław Leśmian
