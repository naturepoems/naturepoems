Find the solace in the reeds,
    find the beauty in the quiet,
        for each heartbeat
         is woven in the wind.
As the sky deepens with dreams,
    echoing through valleys,
        we touch the past,
        and let the present unfold.

   Life flows as a river,
       carrying us deeper,
          into the heart
       of all that waits,
       patiently.


- William Stafford
