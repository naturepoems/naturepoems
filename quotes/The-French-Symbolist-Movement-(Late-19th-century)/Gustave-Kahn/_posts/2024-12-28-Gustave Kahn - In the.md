In the Garden

A hush blankets the garden bare,
Where shadows drape like loversâ€™ sighs,
Every blossom, a soft prayer,
As silence hides the last goodbye.

Petals fall with gentle grace,
Landing softly like memories, hushed,
In this sacred, green embrace,
Where the heart finds peace, crushed.

- Gustave Kahn
