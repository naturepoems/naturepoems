Looking out over this beautiful lake,
at a distance, it looks like a glass,
so smooth and serene, a silent space
where whispers of life linger,
like a memory outside of time.

The trees stand tall and watchful,
their leaves shimmering in the breeze,
like secrets being shared,
as the sun dips low, a golden orb,
powering the world with its light.

Nature sings a song of continuity,
reminding me that we are all connected,
each ripple in the water,
a reminder of existence,
flowing in harmony.

- Alice Walker
