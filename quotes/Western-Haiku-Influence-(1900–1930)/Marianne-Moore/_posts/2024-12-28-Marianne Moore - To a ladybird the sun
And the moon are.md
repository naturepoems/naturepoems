And the moon are"

author: Marianne Moore
quote: "To a ladybird, the sun
And the moon are as insects staying still—
Yet under the rock and around the edge
The grass is played upon as a child.
In distant view the vault is filled
With the day’s unpromising hues."

To a ladybird, the sun
And the moon are as insects staying still—
Yet under the rock and around the edge
The grass is played upon as a child.
In distant view the vault is filled
With the day’s unpromising hues.

- Marianne Moore
