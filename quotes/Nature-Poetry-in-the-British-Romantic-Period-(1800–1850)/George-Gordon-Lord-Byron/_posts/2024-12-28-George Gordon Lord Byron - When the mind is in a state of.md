When the mind is in a state of distress,
And all around is wild, confused, and drear,
Then seek the soothing wilderness,
Let nature’s voice, your spirit, cheer.

Where trees stand tall, and rivers play,
And fragrant blooms in splendor show,
In nature’s arms, you’ll find a way
To banish all your cares and woe.

- George Gordon Lord Byron
