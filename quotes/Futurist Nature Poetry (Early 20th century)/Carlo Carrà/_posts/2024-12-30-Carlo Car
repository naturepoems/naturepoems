In autumn’s embrace, gold and red,
Leaves crunch beneath, a shuffling song,
A rustling symphony in every step,
Nature’s farewell, a bittersweet caress.

Branches skeletal reach for the sky,
Their stories whisper of seasons passed,
In every twist, a memory held,
In every flutter, a breath of grace.

Misty mornings veil the horizon,
Fog rolls as a delightfully soft shroud,
Transforming the ordinary to ethereal,
Choreographing shadows in stillness.

Football fields blanketed in ochre,
Children leap delighted in piles of leaves,
Laughter mingling with autumn's crisp air,
The joyous dance of fleeting moments.

In nature’s cycle, a lesson remains,
Even in decay, beauty survives,
In every turning leaf and whispering wind,
We find hope- a promise for tomorrow.

- Carlo Carrà
