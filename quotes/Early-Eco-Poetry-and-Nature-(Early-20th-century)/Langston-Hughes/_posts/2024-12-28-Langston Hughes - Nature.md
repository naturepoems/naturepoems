Nature

The trees and the leaves are singing,
The birds and the streams are humming,
And the sun is traveling through the sky.
Feel the vibration of every leaf,
Let every ripple wash over me.

I’m drunk on the tickle of the wind,
Grown soft with the glow of the moon.
I am nature, and nature is me,
We’ve merged and created this new life.

- Langston Hughes
