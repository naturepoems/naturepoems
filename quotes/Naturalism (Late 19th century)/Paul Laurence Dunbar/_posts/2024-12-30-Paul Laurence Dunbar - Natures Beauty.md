The grass is green, the skies are blue,  
And all without a care are you.  
You are the ever-caring one,  
And take the time to watch life's run.  

The gentle breeze, the rippling stream,  
The vibrant world where sunbeams gleam.  
You smile at flowers, bright and gay,  
And lose yourself in their display.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
