As the day takes flight on the wings of the dawn,
Reflecting the dreams that the night has withdrawn,
We move through the currents of energy flow,
Embracing the wild as we learn to let go.

In every horizon, there's a story untold,
Of nature's endurance, both timid and bold,
In this tapestry of life, we'll find our own voice,
In the union of worlds, together rejoice!

- Russolo Luigi
