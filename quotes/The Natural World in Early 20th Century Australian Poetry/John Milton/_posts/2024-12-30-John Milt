The Hymn

A solemn hymn, O quiet vale,
This solitude, where whispers tell of trees,
In the murmured breeze, and stars in the pale,
Where visions bloom in mindâ€™s embrace,
For Time and Nature and rhyme do sound,
In the sacred gems of silent days,
In holy color and celestial space,
From earth to heavens, doth Nature rise!


- John Milton
