The Going
Why do you go? Where do you rise?
Your journey will lead through the centuries.
Where past these mortals, only skywise,
Is found for you a grand appeal.

Speak to me yet but a living tear,
The heart's cry heard beyond the days of bonds;
Tell me that sweeter days and clearer
Will carry the truth of our soirees on,

Can I be waiting no more than the waves,
With your tranquil smile, shining in the sky?
O unturned solitude, heed now the gravest cares,
Silencing only the rooster's cry!

- Thomas Hardy
