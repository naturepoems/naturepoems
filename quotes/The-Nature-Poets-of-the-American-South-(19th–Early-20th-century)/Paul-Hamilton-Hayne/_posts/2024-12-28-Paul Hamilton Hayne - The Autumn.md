The Autumn Wind

Listen! the autumn wind is in the pine,
And on the sapling trees a voice that calls,
The melody that twines along the vine,
Like distant echoes from the distant halls.
In every rustling leaf, each whistling breath
Is borne a promise from the bending boughs,
To fill once more the chalice of the death-  
Brothers of little wings, in soft repose,
Look up in awe to every hand that weaves
The carpet of the woods with golden leaves,
For each sweet song of nature tells the truth,
Not gained by art, but drawn from childhood's youth.
