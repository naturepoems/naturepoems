In the stillness of the night,
when the stars are alive and twinkling,
I hear the earth breathe,
the soft rustle of leaves,
the delicate song of crickets,
reminding me of all that is unseen.

Moonlight spills like silver,
illuminating the path ahead,
while shadows hold secrets,
both familiar and foreign.
Here, in the embrace of nature,
I find clarity among the chaos.
