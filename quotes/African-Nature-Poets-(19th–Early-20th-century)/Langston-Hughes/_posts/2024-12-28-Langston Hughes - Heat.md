Heat

The sun beats down,
The sky dazzles blue,
And the world bursts alive
In a hush of heat.

Silence vibrates,
The air drips thick,
A misty veil over the golden
Fields, rivers, and trees.

I dream of shade,
Of gentle breezes,
Of deep rivers whispering
Through the lush, green branches.

- Langston Hughes
