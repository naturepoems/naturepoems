The ocean sings   
to me this evening,   
as the sun folds down   
into the wild waves —  
that tremendous pull,   
that soft allure,   
calling the earth’s hearts.  

The skies open deep   
and I remember   
each hour gone,   
each drop from the clouds.  

It is all   
nourishment,   
suffering and joy,   
this great sea and the sky.
