Ode to the Flowers

Emblems of beauty, in gardens sweet,  
With hues so bright, your joys repeat.  
You dance in air, on zephyr's breath,  
A gentle hymn that conquers death.

Come, let us wander, soft, near trees,  
Where sunlight kisses, and hums the breeze;  
In shades of green, your colors gleam,  
Nature's pure art, a vivid dream.

Oh flowers! Share your secrets near,  
Of love and loss, of joy and fear;  
You bloom, you fade, yet through the years,  
In hearts you dwell, beyond all tears.

- Alphonse de Lamartine
