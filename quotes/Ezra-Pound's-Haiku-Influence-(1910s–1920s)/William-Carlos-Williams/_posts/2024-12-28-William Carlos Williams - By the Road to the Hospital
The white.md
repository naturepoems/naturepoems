quote: "By the Road to the Hospital
The white and golden
cecilia's blooms,
peering from
behind the fountain’s
place,
chased by the sun,
are blushing,
because they make
so sweet a ground
for all to feast on."

By the Road to the Hospital
The white and golden
cecilia's blooms,
peering from
behind the fountain’s
place,
chased by the sun,
are blushing,
because they make
so sweet a ground
for all to feast on.

- William Carlos Williams
