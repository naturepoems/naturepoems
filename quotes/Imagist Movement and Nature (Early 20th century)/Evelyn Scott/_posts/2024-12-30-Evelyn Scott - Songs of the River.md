The river sings a song
Caught in the laughing windâ€”
Rippling phrases that twine
Through the rushes, cool, unsullied.
What secrets does it carry?
It wanders far, touched by stones,
Whispering gently to the shores,
In every bend and turn,
An affirmation of life,
Of dreams, daring to flow.

- Evelyn Scott
