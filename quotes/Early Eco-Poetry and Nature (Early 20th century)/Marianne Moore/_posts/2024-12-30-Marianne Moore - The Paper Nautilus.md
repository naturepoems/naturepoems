The Paper Nautilus

    I.  Submission
        and rigidity
            give it its lustre.  
As if looking
        out through fog,
                I see it.
   I would lie on the
        beach and watch
        for it; or while
            my eyes were at
                the edge of this
                    one great sand,
                        beheld
        it halt, and when
        pushed over, rest.
    Why should
    it offend my touch?
    A lively
        smoothness
        is demanded; to me, 
    however, the part
        is defined.  
This shell bears
    witness to the making.
