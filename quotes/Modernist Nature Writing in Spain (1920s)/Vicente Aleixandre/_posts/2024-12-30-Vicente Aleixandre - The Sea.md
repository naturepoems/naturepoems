The sea is so much more
than what I say,
it moves, it breathes
and doesn't lie.

What they seek is mists,
only mists.
To be found,
I send them weights,
to make them heavy with earth.

The sea is new at every moment.
The sea is old, young,
to come and go, to give smoke,
to become what we are not.

- Vicente Aleixandre
