The Horizon

Beyond the plains where deer roam free,
   And rivers weave like silver threads,
The horizon calls, a song for me,
   With every rise, my spirit spreads.

In shades of orange, purple, and blue,
   The promise of dawn awakens the night,
And nature sings a tune so true,
   A symphony in the morning light.

As I stand at the edge of all I see,
   In the vast expanse, I'm whole, I'm real,
The horizon whispers, 'Come fly with me,'
   My heart, it swells as the world reveals.
