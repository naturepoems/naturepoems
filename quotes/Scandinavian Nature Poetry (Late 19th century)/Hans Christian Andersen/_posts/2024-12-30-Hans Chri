In every breath, the earth will sigh,  
A symphony of life, passing by;  
In every rustle, in every sigh,  
Nature's secrets, never lie.  

So take a moment, pause, and see,  
The beauty that surrounds thee;  
For in nature's grace, you'll come to know,  
The magic of life, as it ebbs and flows.

- Hans Christian Andersen
