A Wildflower
In wild meadows where blossoms play  
And flutter 'neath the cautious sun,  
Thou bright wildflower raises sway  
In colors great, together run.
 
With breath of warmth, and gentle breeze,  
The life that's born shall dance and greet,  
With every shade a harmony  
In every blossom, pure and sweet.

- John Clare
