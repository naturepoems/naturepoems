The tempest swells, the thunder grows,
Yet in the forest, peace remains;
The towering trees, in patient pose,
Stand witness to the stormy pains.
All life beneath their arms does thrive,
In quiet strength, they greet the squall;
And from their roots, all things survive,
Preserving nature's sacred call.


- Gustave Flaubert
