Hawk in the Rain

I

The hawk’s cry is a thin razor
A shriek, frozen in air
Like a knife in a skull.
It slides through the rain, tracks
Down the mental spaces of
The hunter’s heart.
The field is trembling, waiting.
With his dark birdof prey eyes,
He listens for the falling
Of rats and mice, as they scratch
At the earth.

II

This is the heart of the matter:
The deep drop of his joy
Is in the slaughter. Hunger
Hones his instinct, carving
Him sharp in a field of other.
Through the deafening rains,
He flies, a glorious dark
Embodiment of the grudge,
The rapture that awaits.

- Ted Hughes
