The frosted air wraps the world in stillness,
As winterâ€™s breath blankets all that it finds,
The echo of silence, profound and deep,
Awakens the thoughts that winter unwinds.

I wander through snowflakes, delicate lace,
Each flake a story, unique and unbent,
In this icy domain, I seek warmth,
In the heart of the cold, my spirit is sent.


- Anna Akhmatova
