Cruising with the Stars

I drive the winding roads,
with the windows down,
the world spilling out,
a sprawling canvas of life.

The sky transforms, 
a shower of stars,
and I’m rolling,
cruising through toil,
through the wilderness of dreams,
feeling the spirit of the night,
it washes over me,
soothing the tangled thoughts,
beckoning a depth of freedom,
inviting me to lose my way.

Cruising with the stars,
a companion in the night,
do I dare chase the horizon?
Shall we all go forth,
to merge with the woods,
to meet the moon in her cradle?
