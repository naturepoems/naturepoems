The sun descends in hues of orange,
As evening blankets the rolling hills;
Stars awaken, soft and shimmering,
In the hush where time stands still.

The night unfolds a quilt of dreams,
Threads of starlight woven tight;
In the silence, peace settles gently,
A lullaby of nature's night.

Breathe in deep this tranquil air,
Let the magic enfold your soul;
For in the heart of nature’s wonder,
You’ll find a solace, pure and whole.

- Arthur Rimbaud
