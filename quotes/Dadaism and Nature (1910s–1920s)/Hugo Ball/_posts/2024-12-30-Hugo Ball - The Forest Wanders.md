The Forest Wanders
Deep in the realm of silence,
Between timber and dusk,
The forest sings an ancient song,
With echoes that one can feel.
Leaves murmur beneath whispering skies,
Creating patterns like a soft quilt -
Where the mystery swells and thrives.

Branches twist in ballet form,
As shadows chase the last rays
Of the blushing sun, who yawns low
Over tranquil pools reflecting wishes,
Which map the stars' way back home, 
Leaving beauty carved in nature's heart.

- Hugo Ball
