Riprap

Lay down these words
Before your mind like stones.
Fashion these into a line,
Like a mantra, or a prayer,
You will be diving into these words,
Diving into the depths of the sea.
Facts—exist, facts exist,
And beyond each fact—
The open wound, the fresh breath of events,
Stage by stage.
An arc of human life
Is a curve of dark and light,
To cross the treasure of nature,
To touch the border of complex things.

The world is filled with organisms,
Bind the earth with your thoughts,
Let these poems be a bridge,
A path time can circle on.
The silver strands of your breath,
And time fluctuate,
Make a weave of the simplest words, and
You will find light.

- Gary Snyder
