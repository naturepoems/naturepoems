The river sings a liquid spell,
In curvèd banks, its stories dwell.
Each ripple tells of mystic dreams,
Flowing forth like silver streams.

In moonlight's glow, the water gleams,
And starlit nights weave tender themes.
Oh, let me wander by your side,
In every turn, I shall abide.


- Zora Neale Hurston
