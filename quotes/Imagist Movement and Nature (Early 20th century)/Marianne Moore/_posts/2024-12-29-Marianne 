The Fable

In the swiftness of the wind’s
whistle, pushes through the leaves
like silver, firm in fortune,
towards the crest
of yet another ridge:
there burst flame and shadow,
boundless beauty of brush and petal,
rtaves side by side.

Through deep canyons,
they crawl up currents,
inputting sunshine; and how
some mighty trees relate—
sharply drawing lines,
vibrations of a dream’s
flowery grace—affixed,
boundless, and wilfully so,
both our scream and breath.

Let’s start again,
before the cracks,
with leaf and thoughts unwrapped;
we took to skies,
or beneath the stars,
playing dusk in opening moments,
yet, in this fable,
we split all fortunes clear,
its thriving light aflame.

It cannot rise alone;
trees attract and hold,
while our thoughts pour slowly,
times have changed,
yet nature ambles through.

- Marianne Moore
