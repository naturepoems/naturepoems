Nature’s Question

Doesn't it seem that somewhere
   the molecules of grass and stone
have begun to disintegrate
   separating out the elements,
  breathing a new substance, anew—and seems,
that a hint of structure lies concealed
   both in fathoms of distance
   and within the dreams
    of shadow and delirium,
     in places you may think are vacant.
And unlike any form of pleasure,
   each may become a new thing entirely,
   love itself,  as the oceans whisper
    and all repletion feeds this chaos.


- Marianne Moore
