A Morning in Summer

The morn is bright, the air is sweet,
I wander where the flowers greet;
Their petals soft, with sheen of dew,
A fragrant welcome, fresh and new.

Beneath the trees the shadows play,
Where light and leaf intertwine in sway;
Each sound a murmur from the brook,
A fairy tale, a storybook.

The lark does soar beyond the hill,
With joyous notes that seem to thrill;
In nature's arms, I softly rest,
And in her beauty feel the blessed.

- Thomas Woolner
