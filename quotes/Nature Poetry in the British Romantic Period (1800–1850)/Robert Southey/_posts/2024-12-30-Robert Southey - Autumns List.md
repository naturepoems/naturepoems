O Autumn in thy sad decay,
Thy boughs stripped bare, thy flowers pale,
Yet all things down thy hidden way,
Retain their worth, still, join the Tale,
Of days when Life was full of glow,
Beneath thy gold, resplendent gleam.
Thy quiet heart shall still bestow,
The radiance of a tranquil dream.

-- Robert Southey, "Autumn's List"
