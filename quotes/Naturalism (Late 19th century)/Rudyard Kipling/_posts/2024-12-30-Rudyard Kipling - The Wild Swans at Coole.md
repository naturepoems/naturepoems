The Wild Swans at Coole

The trees are in their autumn beauty,
     The woodland paths are dry,
Under the leaves that are  yellowing,
     The sky is a blue-grey lie.

And the wild swans come sailing,
     Across the moonlit glade,
In the falls of the shimmering waters —
     The dance of the light has made!

Come take of the nature, and play the sweet tune,
As the swans will glide through each silvery rune,
We find ourselves lost — where soft shadows sprawl,
And Nature calls gentle with wonders for all!

- Rudyard Kipling
