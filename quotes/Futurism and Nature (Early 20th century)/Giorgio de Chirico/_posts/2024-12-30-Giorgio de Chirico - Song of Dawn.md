A lone bird rises in the dawn, 
Her wings slicing through the crisp air,
She sings a note of joy and longing, 
In the quiet expanse of new beginnings.

The mist, like a lover's gentle caress,
Wraps the earth in cool, soft reminders,
Of a night's old stories spun in shadows,
As the daybreak awakens all that lives.

I walk the path of forgotten dreams,
Where each step echoes with purpose,
The soil, rich with history’s whispers,
And the sun kisses the flowers’ tired heads.

- Giorgio de Chirico
