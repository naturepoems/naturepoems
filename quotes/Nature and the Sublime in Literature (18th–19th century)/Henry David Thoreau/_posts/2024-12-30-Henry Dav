In the Meadow

In the meadow green and bright,
With flowers clasped in pure delight,
Nature's cradle, soft and warm,
The heart finds peace—a healing balm.

Beneath the sky, so vast, so clear,
Every whispering breeze draws near,
Where the grain and wildherb blend,
Each moment a sweet, winding end.

- Henry David Thoreau
