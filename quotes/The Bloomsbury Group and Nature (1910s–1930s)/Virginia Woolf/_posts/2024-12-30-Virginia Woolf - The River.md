A river, ever flowing,
With waters embracing the sky;
Eternally unhindered,
A spirit as wild as the wind,
Caching dreams 
Within its gurgled sighs,
It carries fragments of life,
Memories forged in cool depths,
Sweet murmurs of faraway lands
And time that refuses to yield.

— **Virginia Woolf, The River**
