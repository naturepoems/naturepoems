The gentle snow, a soft embrace,
A blanket white on nature’s face,
Each flake unique, an art divine,
In winter’s charm, our hearts align.

By fireside, we gather close,
While outside winter paints its prose,
In stillness deep, the world feels new,
In nature’s frost, our spirits grew.

- Charles Lane
