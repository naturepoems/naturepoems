To the River Charles
By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

River ! that in silence windest
Through the meadows of my childhood, 
Keep me, autumn-awakened,
In pace of waters glimmered; 
Bring me, between thee and me,
The lightened banks of old memory; 
Give me, once more, the shinning height,
Where the lilies build their awe, 
Dewy clouds of tranquility!
