I dwell in Possibility—  
A fairer House than Prose—  
More numerous of Windows—  
Superior—for Doors—  

Narrower—that’s my way,  
Fringed with the purple line—  
There, it meets the world—  
In each aspect,  

With Else—in my Living Space—!  
The Mountain’s sheer—  
For me to determine—  
What I will be—in the Forest’s—  

For pleasure stands beyond!  

*I dwell in Possibility*

- Emily Dickinson
