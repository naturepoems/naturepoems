The Cycle

Under the boughs of old visitations,  
The earth reveals its circles:  
The seedling, the bloom, the withering—  
A sturdy tree that will become,
And the cycle whispers of life—
How everything intertwines in time.

The dance of the seasons speaks,
Each soft trembling leaf,  
Each drop of rain,  
All part of nature’s creation,  
Where the thread of existence weaves together,  
Each heartbeat, a reminder  
Of our place among the stars.


- Robert Bly
