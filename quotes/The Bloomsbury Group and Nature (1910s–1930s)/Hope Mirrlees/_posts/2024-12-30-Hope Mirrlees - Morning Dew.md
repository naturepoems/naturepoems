MORNING DEW

Each sparkling bead, on the blade of green,
A drop of the sun's first gift, unseen,
Lies patiently waiting for shadows to spin,
A world holding still, as the day begins.

As the sun stretches forth, its golden embrace,
Every glimmer on grass a fragile trace,
Of dreams in the dawn, soft whispers to keep,
As nature unravels the night’s gentle sleep.

The flowers once shy in their night-shaded gloom,
Now unfurl with a stretch, with a sigh, they bloom.
Each crystalline droplet melts into the air,
A promise of life, of beauty laid bare.
