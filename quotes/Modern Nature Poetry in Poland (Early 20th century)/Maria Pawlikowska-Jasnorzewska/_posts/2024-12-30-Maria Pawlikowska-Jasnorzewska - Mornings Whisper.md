In the gilded silence of dawn,
when the world hasnâ€™t fully awakened,
I wander through the dew-kissed grass,
feeling the delicate touch of morning.
Each petal sings a lullaby,
whispering secrets from the night.

Oh, how I long for the woods,
for the sweet, damp earth,
where shadows play and dance,
where the air is filled
with the breath of old trees,
ancient spirits of nature.

Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
