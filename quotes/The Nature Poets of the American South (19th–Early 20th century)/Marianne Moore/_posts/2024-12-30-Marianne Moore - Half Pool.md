Half Pool

A blackbird, or a raindrop,
    dwarfed by it, cowers to decompose—
  still in the light of this lily painting,
     lavished around the still pool, a movement,
        or an exploration of the mind,
         a query in each droplet, returning back
to the surface. The soft-petaled forms
    are heavy and weighing down more 
   in the absolute quiet of the colors
     and the background itself feels beneath,
      alive with damp. 

And to think of virtues tarried here,
embraces of shadows, shades of nature.
  There were muses rippling near, stirring—a pause,
and a reference interred in the yielding cloth
      of spring. 


- Marianne Moore
