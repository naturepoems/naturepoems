Autumn

The scents of earth begin to rise anew,
To breathe the fragrant murmur of the leaves;
And every path the foot of man may strew
Is cloaked with gold and red, like azure eves.

The quiet woods, with thrilling songs of gold,
Exclaim their joy in flickering streaks of light,
While blushing fruits, like wine of autumn's hold,
Burst fondly forth, a harvest rich and bright.

- Paul Hamilton Hayne
