The quiet stream reflects the sky,
The leaves are painted gold and brown;
Among the shades, I feel your sigh—
In Nature’s heart, I lay me down.

The beauty that is all around,
In every breath, in every sound,
The wild roses bloom in my soul—
In Nature’s embrace, I am whole.


- Edna St Vincent Millay
