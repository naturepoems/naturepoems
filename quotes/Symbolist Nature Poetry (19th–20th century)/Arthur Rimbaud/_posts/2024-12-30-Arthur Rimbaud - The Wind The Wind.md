The wind, the wind! That wild mother call,
That swings the branches and makes the leaves fall,
Carries me high on the wings of desire,
Beyond the horizons where unquenchable fire
Reaches through valleys, the mist draws near,
Where nature wanders free, devoid of fear.
Dancing through shadows this darkening scene,
All of life spins in a golden sheen.

- Arthur Rimbaud
