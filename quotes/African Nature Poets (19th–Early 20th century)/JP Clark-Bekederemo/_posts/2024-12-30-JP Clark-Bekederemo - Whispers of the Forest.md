Through forests dark and deep,
Where shadows play and shift,
The whispers of the ancients,
Are gifts the branches lift.

A canopy of stories,
With leaves as pages turned,
In every twist and turn,
A new lesson is learned.

Embrace the quiet moments,
In nature’s wide expanse,
For here within the wild,
Life invites us to dance.

- JP Clark-Bekederemo
