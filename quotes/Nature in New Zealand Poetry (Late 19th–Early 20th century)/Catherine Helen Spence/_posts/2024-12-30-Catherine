The Dew

In the morning’s early blush,  
The dewdrops glisten on the grass,  
And highlight every leaf and brush,  
With sparkling notes that gently pass.  

Each droplet holds a universe,  
With morning’s light to share its song;  
A whisper soft—a quiet verse,  
To nature’s heart, where all belong.  

With each dawn’s breath, the world anew,  
With crystal gems the earth adorns;  
The dewdrops’ kiss—a blessing true,  
To greet the day with hope reborn.
