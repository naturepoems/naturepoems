Beauty of the evening,
Stretched out in deep hues,
While the last rays of sunlight
Slide soft over views.
The horizon is painted
With edges of gold,
As day pulls its blanket,
And the night drapes its fold.

In the coolness of dusk,
Where the whispers ignite,
I find my heart’s solace,
In the serenade of night.
And, o’ how I treasure
This gentle embrace,
In the arms of a twilight,
I discover my place.

- Emily Carr
