The twilight knits its shawl of grey,
     melding clouds like soot-stained rags,
        tracing the roots beneath the world,
each story etched beneath the forest.
As the last brush of hue fades,
light they draw cowers behind
   the sleek outlines of trees.

Quiet wraps around, weaving  
          through whispered comments,
      unraveling laughter like feathers,
everything takes its path toward dusk,
yet we linger still along each glade,
hearing silhouettes sing in dreams,
   the way nature opens wide,
and seeks to hold us there forever.
