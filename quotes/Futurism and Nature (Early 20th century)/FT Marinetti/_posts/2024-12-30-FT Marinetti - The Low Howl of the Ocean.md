I listen to the low howl of the ocean,
Rhythmic, in sync with my pulse,
The waves lash against the rocks,
Their wet embrace - a fervent call.

Here, the sky descends into the sea,
Bringing thunderous songs of chaos,
Where every drop of rain becomes a dream,
As fireworks of nature crackle with life.

Let me sink deep into the stories,
That each ripple whispers,
And embrace the wild!  

Only here do I feel alive,
Where the elemental and the machine,
Collide and create new worlds to explore.

- FT Marinetti
