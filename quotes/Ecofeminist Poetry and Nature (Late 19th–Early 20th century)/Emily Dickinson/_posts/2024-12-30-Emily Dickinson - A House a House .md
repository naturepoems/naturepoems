A House, a House –  
The world is in it –  
A deep corridor between  
The signs of life upon it –  

The Roof unfurls against the night –  
And where is It –  
Upon a word of interest  
I could assemble here?  

Surely a chimney there –  
A porch around our walls –  
A care in all but to fall  
Like Apples from my trees –  


- Emily Dickinson
