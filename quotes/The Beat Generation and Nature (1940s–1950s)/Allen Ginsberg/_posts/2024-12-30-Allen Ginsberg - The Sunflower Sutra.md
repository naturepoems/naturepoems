The Sunflower Sutra

I walked on the banks of the river
And found the sunflowers
Standing wildly under the burning sun
Looking up, radiant and free,
How they remind me of life's uncertainty,
      the beauty in madness,
I stare, enraptured,
Every petal holds a star, 
In their profound satisfaction
I hear them whisper to me,
   ‘What are you waiting for?’
