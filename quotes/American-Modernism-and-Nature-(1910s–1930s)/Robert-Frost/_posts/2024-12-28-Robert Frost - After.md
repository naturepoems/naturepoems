After Apple-Picking
My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still, and there's a barrel that I didn't fill
Beside it, and another heaped up on the ground.
I count the apples that are gone.

In the farmhouse yard, I always thought
It was like floating in a harvest of all I took.
But now I know that they have much to give
And much to lose, and much to bring back to the earth.

For I half thought I was done with picking, and I hear
The sound of the wooden floor beneath my feet.
And I told myself, I am done, but I'm not done.

And when I wake in the morning I'm not in the orchard
I hear the sound of fresh rain coming up the road .

- Robert Frost
