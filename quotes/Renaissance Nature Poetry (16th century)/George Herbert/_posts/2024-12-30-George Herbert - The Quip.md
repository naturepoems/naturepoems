The Quip

I am a flute; thy hand, O Lord, doth fill.  
I speak because thou dost prompt my sound,  
From the grass and the flowers  
And all spirits around me shall be blessed  
To know there's peace,  
When the night shall wane.  
And shall leave our gifts  
For that sweet solace will begin anew,  
To sing together on blessed ground.



- George Herbert
