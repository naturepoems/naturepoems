THE BUTTERFLY

Upon a lily-white sail in the air,
Flutter of wings, oh butterfly rare!
You dance on the edge of the dew-sparked faded
Clover, like dreams that the dawn has traded.

A flash of joy in the wide open sky,
For a moment you linger, then swoop on by.
Soft whispers of breezes where wild blossoms sway,
The world bends to watch you, then you sweep away.

A heart big as summer, so soft yet so free,
You flit through the valleys, the leaves of the tree,
Bringing light where the shadows lay low,
Oh sweet, fickle creature, we rarely know.


- Hope Mirrlees
