When You Are Old
When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;

How many loved your moments of glad grace,
And loved your beauty with love false or true,
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;

And bending to the challenge of his arch,
Your beauty for a moment would not stay,
But all that it is knows the mountain’s edge  
And the gaze that passed beyond the form gives way.

So tell the stars that know you so divine,
Speak to their graves, so lavish light they crave.
Live with the brightness of one that knows,  
Who loved your depths and made them wild to weave without fears.

- William Butler Yeats
