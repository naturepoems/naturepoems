To Marguerite

We were apart; but, as before,  
I felt your presence—oh, to see  
Beyond the forms of love, the sea,  
I heard it rumbling on the shore.  
Your beauty went beyond the day  
All through my heart, save this dark rhyme  
The misty fountain strengthens time  
And joy can hardly gleam one ray.  

All things were gathered round, above,  
The full moon spread her cheerful beams,  
And luring glances clung to dreams  
And asked me as the stars ask love.  
Let us then live for, other springs,  
The night that we did wait, like you—  
Whence should our beauty, then, accrue,  
Sweet heav’nly bonds denying rings.  

But, oh! as fleeting hearts may find  
A seraph’s whispers into play;  
Your voice, that chime against the day,  
Lightens my soul, as love is blind.  
Though beauty lives, no death can break  
The nature of our solemn oath;  
We are but moons, all lonely growth—  
The dream of faith, it is up-taken.


- Matthew Arnold
