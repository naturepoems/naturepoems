Twilight

In twilight's sheen where shadows creep,
And time extends his gentle hand,
I find the whispers soft and deep,
That nature sings of distant land.

The evening star begins to glow,
A silent guide in skies so wide;
In tranquil thoughts, I feel the flow,
Of beauty's tide, my soul’s true guide.

- Thomas Woolner
