The mountains wear their capes,
Draped in white and grey,
As winter whispers softly,
And holds the world at bay.

In the stillness, there’s a magic,
A hush that fills the air,
Where nature dons her beauty,
In a cloak we all can share.

Let us wander in the snow,
With hearts both brave and bold,
For in nature’s frozen grip,
Warm stories are retold.
