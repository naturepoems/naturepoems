A single flower blooms in a forgotten field,
Its vibrant colors speak, though it’s not revealed.
In the silence around, its beauty survives,
A testament to life in the struggles of strives.

Among the wild grasses, it dances with grace,
A reminder that hope can still find its place.
In every petal's soft touch lies the proof,
That beauty endures, and life’s never aloof.

- Gerald Brenan
