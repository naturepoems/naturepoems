Waves of the Sea

Oceans roar and whisper sweet,
At waters’ edge, where land does meet,
The rhythm of tides, a timeless song,
With every wave, we too belong.

Seagulls cry in the salt-kissed air,
A dance of freedom, without a care,
In the sun's warm glow, the horizon spreads,
In the depths below, the mystery threads.

The sea calls forth, a siren's plea,
In wild embrace, we’re wild and free,
With every tide, our worries cease,
In nature’s vastness, we find peace.


- Anna Maria Møller
