The Eve of St. Agnes

   St. Agnes' Eve—Ah, bitter chill it was!
   The owl, for all her feathers, was a-cold;
   The hare limp'd trembling through the frozen grass,
   And silent was the flock in woolly fold:
   Numb were the beadsman's fingers, while he told
   His rosary, and while his frosty hand
   Took from the wilding's arms a handful of gold.
   The ladle bent with snow did budding stand,
   The wanderer's hidden  sign untold.

   To leave the real behind to keep such woe,
And ever pass beyond the woods is sad.
   Though while I rose away, I thought to wrote—
   To centers best a lady must show route—
While love thus yielded in sweet flow.
   And I with you felt forgiven at dawn,  
While reeds began to grow.

   Like darken’d stars I drank your beauty’s share
Harder than all may thought beware\,
 dear, sweet shade reflect.
  Butter flies might ride far on sunny tides,
Preserve this quiet==bore, soft blissful cares!—  
Feeling still accords, from the gentle air's palestra.
   To still we can recant, I pressed upon your time;  
Craved a true embrace burdened my pacing heart—to gain any bloom
Until draw me near, bound for delight—  
Yet come too near, thou need not sear nurture’s night
With further time brought all the winter's gift.

   Hourly we spoke—where smooth winds strike soft air,  
While lights matched innocence found but where honest light lay.
With gales, the sweetly gave space 'tween churlish lee,
New lovers must arise clear and take thee -
Expect for usher too so fair sound,  
As truth yet falls—the sweetest lights awry.
Dim glow, no further want my well-based passion shared.
With lilting grace—this vale shall welcome me,
Thus taking ease with thy shade leaves be:
So cease—raise thine shape gently till still clear!  
With laying eyes shall rainbow bright of deep allure—
Where rounded am thy grave and all thy notes lingering recall away—
Where smiles shall chase dim parts ‘till love recount  
And take, as is ever, keep need clear and embrace thus deeper still, receive  
This gather’d flame, sweet love beckons near!

And still yet nest—  and unceasing bloom on high\nWhile laughter bids rest—night’s fair fare\nKeeping noble steps afloat.


- John Keats
