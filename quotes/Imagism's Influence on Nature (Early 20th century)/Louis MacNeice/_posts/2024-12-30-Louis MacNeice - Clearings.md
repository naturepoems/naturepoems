The trees in the clearing stand alone;
The echoes of the woodlands dimmed;
Like voices of memories lost and gone,
In shadows the bright promises trimmed.

And a whisper of warmth settles deep,
Before the wild tune breaks free;
In the circle of time, I linger and weep
a quiet song of harmony.


- Louis MacNeice
