Upon Appleton House

My Lord, I must confess my soul
Takes pleasure where the apple trees extol,
In wealthy blooms as they hang upon the bough,
Like loversâ€™ hearts that never show a frown.

A bright and verdant scene doth greet my gaze,
Amidst each winding path, a quaint amaze.
The blossoms blow, with sweetening scents to tempt,
While bees assist where nature's skill exempt.

And yet, beneath those boughs of verdant shade,
My thoughts grow restless, and my heart is laid
Where all the treasures of the Earth entwine,
To half embrace the glory that is thine.

So, let me sit among the flowers bright,
In tranquil joys where day yields forth to night.
The sweet repose of mossy beds does thrive,
And all around, may earth's great secrets strive.


- Andrew Marvell
