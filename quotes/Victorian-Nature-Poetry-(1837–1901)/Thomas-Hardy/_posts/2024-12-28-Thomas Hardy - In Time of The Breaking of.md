In Time of 'The Breaking of Nations'
The morning was full of the sound of the sea,
The morning sparkled and danced with rain.
The day that seamed the hills like a feathered tree,
Was breaking wild between black and plain.

Though I stood watching the flicker and flow,
The sun was hidden behind the snow.
And sad for all our avarice,
The trees drew nearer while the waters churned,
The banks fell silent as the white swans burned.

And trains still darted to the sea,
Yet lost on their way, unseen, unheard,
The music died, the summits shadowed me,
While time paved heaven's cause for all I would have stirred.

- Thomas Hardy
