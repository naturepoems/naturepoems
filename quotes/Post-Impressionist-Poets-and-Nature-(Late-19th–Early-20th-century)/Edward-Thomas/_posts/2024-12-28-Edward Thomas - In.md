In Memoriam
Each morning painted with soft sighs,
And whispers lost beneath the pines.
A gaze upon the silent lake,
‘Tis nature’s breath, a memory’s wake.

The flowers bloom in poignant grace,
Remnants of love in nature’s embrace,
Every petal a soft refrain,
Of quiet passion, of joy and pain.

- Edward Thomas
