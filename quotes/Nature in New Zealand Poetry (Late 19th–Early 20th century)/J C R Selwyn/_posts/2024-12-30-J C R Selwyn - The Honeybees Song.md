The Honeybee’s Song
Within the bloom, the honeybee,
A tireless worker, wild and free,
Her humble song, a sweet delight,
As petals sway in warm sunlight.

With grace, she flits from bloom to bloom,
In hues of gold, dispelling gloom,
In every sip, her labor's prize,
A gift of nectar, love's sweet ties.

O little bee, oh wondrous sight,
In your soft dance, the world feels right,
For in your toil, there's joy and worth,
A testament to life on earth.

So let us celebrate your flight,
In harmony with nature’s light,
For in each drop, we come to see,
The sweetness of our unity.

- J C R Selwyn
