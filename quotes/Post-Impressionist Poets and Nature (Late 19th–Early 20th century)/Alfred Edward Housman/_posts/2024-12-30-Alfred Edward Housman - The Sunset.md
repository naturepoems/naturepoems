The sun, that rose in light so bright,
Now hides behind the hills of might,
The shadows lengthen on the grass,
As day gives way, grey minutes pass.

Yet still the stars will find their way,
And light the night that follows day,
Among the quiet trees they gleam,
A silent hymn, a haunting dream.


- Alfred Edward Housman
