Spring's Awakening  
From the crevices of winter  
Life creeps slowly,  
A cautious embrace  
Of warm sun,  
While the frost retreats,  
Trembling in shadows  
Left empty to breathe.  

The flowers yawn and stretch,  
Filling the air  
With a scent of promise,  
Each petal a star,  
Painting the ground  
With dreams in bloom  
Caught in a field of desires,  
From which love shall rise  
Once more.  

And the woods awaken,  
Shaking their gray sorrows  
Like dust from their backsâ€”  
While the birds rally,  
A chorus of wings  
Calling forth life  
With fervent notes.  

The earth sighs,  
Exhaling a tapestry;  
Each leaf, each blade,  
A story told anew,  
Each sound a heart,  
Resonating the world.

- David Gascoyne
