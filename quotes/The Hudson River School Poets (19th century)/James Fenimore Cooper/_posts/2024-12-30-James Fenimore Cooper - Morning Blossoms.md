With the dawn comes the fragrance,
   Of the petals that bloom,
And the world wakes to beauty,
   Banishing gloom.

Each songbird's sweet greeting,
   Each soft whispering breeze,
Is a promise of springtime,
   And the joy in the trees.

Let me revel in morning,
   As the sunlight breaks free,
For the gift of each daybreak
   Is a treasure to me.

- James Fenimore Cooper
