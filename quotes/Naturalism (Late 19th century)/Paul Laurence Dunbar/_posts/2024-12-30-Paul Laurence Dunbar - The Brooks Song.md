The crystal brook that babbles by,  
Reflects the blue of endless sky.  
With every pebble, twist, and turn,  
In nature's song, the heart will learn.  

Its flowing whispers, soft and sweet,  
Invite us forth, our souls to meet.  
In every drop, a lifetime sings,  
Of peace found deep in simple things.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
