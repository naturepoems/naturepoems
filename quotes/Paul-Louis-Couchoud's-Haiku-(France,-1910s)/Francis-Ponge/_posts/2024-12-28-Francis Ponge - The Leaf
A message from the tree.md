quote: "The Leaf
A message from the tree, vibrant and frail,
In the bright hues of autumn, it dances down,
A final bow, curling in the crisp air,
Joining the whisper of the earth, in preparation."

The Leaf
A message from the tree, vibrant and frail,
In the bright hues of autumn, it dances down,
A final bow, curling in the crisp air,
Joining the whisper of the earth, in preparation.

- Francis Ponge
