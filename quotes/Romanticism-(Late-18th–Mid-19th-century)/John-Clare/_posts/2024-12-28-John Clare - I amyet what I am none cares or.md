---

I am—yet what I am none cares or knows;
My friends forsake me like a memory lost;
I am the self-consumer of my woes—
They rise and vanish in oblivion's host,
Like bubbles on a river's breast, they pass—
Away, away, and gone, for ever gone!

I know not how it is—I cannot choose—
I feel a murmuring in my heart—a sigh,
That brings me back from Nature’s wildered muse 
To see the envy of a solemn sky—
And feel the wildflower bursting forth around me,
As if to say, 'O look—behold Julia!'

I feel like earth, for all things whisper near me,
And all the birds are singing in their nests—
O, Life—O lovely buzz of life’s sweet cheer
Yet, here I stand, in Nature's golden chests,
Alone among the forests, wild and free,
With nothing but my thoughts to stay with me.
