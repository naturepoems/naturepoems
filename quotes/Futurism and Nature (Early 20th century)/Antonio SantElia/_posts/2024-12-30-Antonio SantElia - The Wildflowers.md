The Wildflowers
In fields where wildflowers bloom,
A natural canvas dispels the gloom.
Colors burst, a vibrant spree,
Nature's laughter, wild and free.

Dance of petals in the breeze,
A playground for the wandering bees,
In their presence, we find joy,
In every moment, lifeâ€™s ploy.


- Antonio SantElia
