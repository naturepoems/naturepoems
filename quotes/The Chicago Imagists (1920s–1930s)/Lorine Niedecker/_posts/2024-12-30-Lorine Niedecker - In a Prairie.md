In a Prairie

Down the path I wandered long,
   through grasses pressed,
   with freedom, ever nearer.
Balsam breathed its fragrant notes,
   while bees spun through the brightest bloom —
A glimmer of bonsai, reinvigorated in nature.
A true sense of 
   the ground beneath, awash,
   a trust in the canopies of wishes,
A flick of wind—a sudden hush,
   a heart leaves for the song for good.

- Lorine Niedecker
