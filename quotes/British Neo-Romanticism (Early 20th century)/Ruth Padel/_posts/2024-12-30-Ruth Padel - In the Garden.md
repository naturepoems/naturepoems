In the Garden
In my small garden, a riot of green,  
each bloom a riot of color,  
shouts of joy beneath the sun,  
as stillness hums its tune.

Butterflies flit like thoughts  
just out of reach,  
as bees perform their ballet  
over the petalsâ€™ embrace,  
where time seems to pause and smile.

Here, amidst the scents of earth,  
I find solace, quiet whispers,  
a world alive beneath my fingers,  
its pulse echoing my own heartbeat.

- Ruth Padel
