A Winter Dawn

The woods are still, and the fields are white,
   With snowflakes dreaming along the way;
And hush’d, my heart takes a dear delight,
   As twilight yields to the golden day.

The sun peeks softly o’er the rim,
   Like a child in play with the waning night;
And the snowflakes, kissed by the morning dim,
   Shine in the moment with purest light.

Each tree stands out in a crystal crown,
   A fortress strong through the night’s long chill;
While the stream babbles low, as it tumbles down,
   With a laugh that sparks joy among the hills.

- Lizette Woodworth Reese
