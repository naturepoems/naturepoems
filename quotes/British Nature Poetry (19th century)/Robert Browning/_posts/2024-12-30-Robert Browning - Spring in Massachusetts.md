Spring in Massachusetts,
   The heart jumps at the light,
Oh, the wild dreams and endless trees!
   And the snowdrops in their flight.
The gusts blow softly o'er the ground,
   Where seeds like songbirds sing,
And life twines back to sweet refrainâ€”
   Happy echoes do it bring.
With a breath it fills the sky,
   In prismatic beauty bright; 
So come, sweet lady, trace on high,
   The soaring lark in flight!

- Robert Browning
