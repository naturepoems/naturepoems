Stars in the Night
Stars pierce the canvas of the night,
a million eyes blinking in wonder
watching as the world dances below.

We are small, yet infinite:
each breath resonates,
each heartbeat echoes
through the silence of the universe.

Gaze upwards, dreamers,
a galaxy spins above,
reminding us of our connection—to the cosmos,
to the light, to one another.

- Francis Picabia
