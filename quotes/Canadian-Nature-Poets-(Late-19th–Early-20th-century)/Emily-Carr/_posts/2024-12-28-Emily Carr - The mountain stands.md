The mountain stands firm,
A guard of the night,
Wreathed in the hush
Of the silvered twilight.
Its majesty looming,
In shadows it seethes,
As the whispers of nature
Wrap gently like leaves.

And the rivers, they murmur,
With secrets to keep,
Winding and smiling,
While lovers both sleep.
Oh, to wander and dream
In this vast, wild embrace,
Where earth sings her stories
And time finds its place.

- Emily Carr
