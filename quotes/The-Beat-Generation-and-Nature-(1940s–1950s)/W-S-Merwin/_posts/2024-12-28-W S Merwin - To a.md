To a Waterfowl
by W. S. Merwin

Whither, ’midst falling dew,
While glow the heavens with the light of noon,
Over the silent sky, an ocean caravan
Dissolves into a feathered plume.
Alone you fly,
And you’ll remember the forest and its rays,
Each perilous wind will send you in many ways
Until you touch the peace of their sage wings.

- W S Merwin
