The summer sunset spills its hues,
In rich magentas and velveteen purples,
And the chirping crickets serenade the night,
In tones that weave through the glowing air.

A hush falls soft on the horizon,
Where day surrenders to the coming stars,
And I, wrapped in the blanket of dusk,
Listen to the world in its gentle repose,
A lullaby sung from the heart of the earth.

- Richard Aldington
