A gentle brook,
where stones laugh,
a melody of movement,
murmuring over pebbles.
Here, I find solace,
a sanctuary
of flowing thoughts,
deep in the green,
a burst of serenity.

Leaves spiral,
a whirl of colors
dancing for the winds,
laughter turning to music,
a chorus of nature.
What stories they tell,!
These branches, wild and free,
a tapestry of existence.

Between the trees,
a path unfolds,
a secret road,
a pilgrimage to peace,
a place to breathe,
a moment to embrace.
Somewhere within,
I leave the world behind,
a figment of thought,
yet grounded in being.

This is my prayer:
a surrender,
a union,
with the elements,
a Dadaist embrace
of the absurd,
of life,
of life unbound.

- Alice Toklas
