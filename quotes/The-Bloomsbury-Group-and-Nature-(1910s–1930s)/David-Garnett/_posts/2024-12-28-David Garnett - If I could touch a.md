If I could touch a flower,
I've so much to declare
I'd touch it ever so lightly
Enough to signal the air.

The fish that glints
And the bird that sings
Are thoughts that soften
The hardness of things.

Through fields where pathways wander,
In silence the shadows cast;
The whispers of the boughs
At evening’s gentle last.

Yet in the gentle breezes,
Among the leaves so high,
Life ebbs and flows like rivers,
Underneath a stretching sky.

What strength there is in nature,
In every leaf and tree;
A lifetime’s worth of wonder
Spanning every sea.

Oh wanderer, take heed,
Of beauty in your way,
Every blossom has a story,
Each dawn begins the day.

The mountains echo softly,
With waterfalls that gleam,
Nature holds its secrets,
Within a silent dream.

And when the twilight dimness
Stretches across the glen,
Know that amidst the stillness,
Life will start anew again.

In meadows filled with daisies,
And stars that grace the night,
Find the pulse of nature,
In every breath of light.

So cherish all that’s living,
With every step you take,
For nature weaves a tapestry,
Of joy for us to make.

- David Garnett
