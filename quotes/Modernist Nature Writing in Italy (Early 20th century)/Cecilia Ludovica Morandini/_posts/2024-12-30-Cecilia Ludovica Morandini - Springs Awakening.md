Spring's Awakening

With each tender bud,
youth emerges from slumber,
as winter's chill retreats,
leaving a promise in its wake.
Colors burst forth in exuberance,
blossoms unfurl like laughter,
while life stirs in rustling grass,
a celebration of rebirth that sings.

Birds return with melodies,
a radiant chorus of hope,
announcing that the world,
a canvas awaiting strokes,
awaits our touch, our breath,
a moment captured in natureâ€™s embrace.

- Cecilia Ludovica Morandini
