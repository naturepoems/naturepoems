The ocean spreads, a canvas blue,  
With waves that crash and foam and play,  
A symphony both vast and true,  
That holds the heart in awe each day.

From sandy shores to depths unknown,  
I find my solace in its might,  
In natureâ€™s depths, I am not alone,  
The sea, my friend, my pure delight.

- Hjalmar Hegner
