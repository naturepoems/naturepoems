The River
  
A golden path is marked across the lying stream,
A ribbon trailing off into the twilight scene.
The murmurs mingle softly with the voice of night,
And earth expands its arms across the silver light.

Far on the eddies turn as stars await to glow,
A tempered sigh won from the heart they know;
As silence heaps its drowsy head upon the shore,
And Heaven breathes in cadence of the river’s roar.

Oh heart, upon thy travels keep thy perfect grace,
For beauty speaks in shadows as they find their place;
Through laughter, pain, or sorrow let this flow align,
With the wayward river’s tune, and love enough, divine.  


- Thomas Wentworth Higginson
