O who can hold the sweet foresight of spring?
The yawning tree waits to crack.
The wind, it sings and the rivers ring,
As life peers forth from the rack.

Each bud and bloom terms out a prayer,
As beauty springs with each hour,
Come forth, thou heart, let your joys declare,
The hush of silence devours the power.

- William Wordsworth
