The sea stretches wide, a canvas of blue,
Waves lap gently on the sun-kissed shore,
Each curl and crash, a timeless story,
Of love and loss, and so much more.

Seagulls call in their plaintive cries,
As the salt air carries the scent of dawn,
In this expanse, an eternal quest,
Natureâ€™s heart beats, forever drawn.

- Gustave Flaubert
