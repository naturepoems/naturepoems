The Shore
O sandy barefoot on the shore,  
Where ocean waves in splendor roar,  
With seagulls soaring in delight;  
Nature dons her great attire bright.

With every tide that ebbs and flows,  
The heart within us longs and knows,  
That life and death do twine anew,  
On shores that shine with every hue.

- Felicia Hemans
