Goodbye to Summer
The summer has gone, and dreary days
Are fast growing lone and lorn,
And with the fading of long array,
The lentil and the corn.
\nYet still the sweet and tender grace
Of yonder oak-studded wood,
And all the name of the simple place
Speaks to life and chimes sweet, just;â€”
\nSo let me lay me down once more,
Upon the grass that thrums,
As underfoot, and shall restore
Who knows more of times and sums?

- George Meredith
