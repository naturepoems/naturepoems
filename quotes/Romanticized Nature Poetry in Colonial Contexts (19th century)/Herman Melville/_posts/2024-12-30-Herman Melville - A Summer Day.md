A Summer Day
On summer’s day where flowers gleam,
In colors rich and scents perfumed,
I walk along where nature dreams,
And feel the peace that life consumes.

The sun drapes gold on fields so wide,
The laughter of the brook runs clear,
With butterflies, the petals glide,
Each moment, sweet as nectar here.

The time unfolds, a gentle sigh,
As whispers play in every bloom,
For in this warmth, the spirit flies,
And dances free from all the gloom.

So let me linger, free and light,
In nature’s arms, where hearts align,
And hold the joy of pure delight,
That summer brings, divine, divine.

— Excerpt from "A Summer Day" (not an actual poem of Melville)

- Herman Melville
