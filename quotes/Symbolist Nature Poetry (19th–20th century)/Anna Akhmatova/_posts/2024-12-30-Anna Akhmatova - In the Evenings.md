In the Evenings

In the evenings, I walk alone,
Through the trees, my heart is light,
The stars are singing in the sky,
And I am filled with pure delight.

The calm of night, the breath of air,
These whispers tell me tales anew,
Of ancient dreams and visions rare,
Painting the truest shades of blue.


- Anna Akhmatova
