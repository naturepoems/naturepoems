The Ocean's Call

The ocean sings its ancient song,  
With crashing waves upon the shore;  
A wild and timeless, flowing throng,  
Whispers of tales from long before.  

Where seagulls glide and waters roar,  
The salt-kissed air ignites the soul;  
In nature's heart, forevermore,  
The ocean’s call will make us whole.
