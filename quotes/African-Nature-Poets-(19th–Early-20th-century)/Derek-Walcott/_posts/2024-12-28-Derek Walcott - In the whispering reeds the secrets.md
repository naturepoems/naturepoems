In the whispering reeds, the secrets lie,
In the quiet pools, dreams reflect,
Nature's embrace, a balm for the soul,
As we walk hand in hand with the earth.
 
 The stars above are distant friends,
Shining on pathways of endless wonder,
And we are mere travelers,
Finding our place under the vast expanse.


- Derek Walcott
