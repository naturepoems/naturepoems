The graceful lark, the grateful heart  
Among the mists of morning rise;  
Her song is Nature's light impart,  
Ascending with the skies;  

In verdant vale, on hill so steep,  
Strong winds that dance with little leaves,  
The gentle touch of earth's soft sweep  
In Nature's art, my spirit believes.

- Michael Drayton
