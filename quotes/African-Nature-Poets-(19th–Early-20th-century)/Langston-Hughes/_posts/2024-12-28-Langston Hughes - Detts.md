Dett’s Cat

In the small, quiet backyard,
A lime green fence surrounds
The silent sun.

A small cat of the night,
With eyes like stars,
Watches the leaves dance
In the gentle breeze.

Sheltered by the sun,
The cat purrs softly,
Dreaming of adventures beyond the void,
In a world where nature sings.

- Langston Hughes
