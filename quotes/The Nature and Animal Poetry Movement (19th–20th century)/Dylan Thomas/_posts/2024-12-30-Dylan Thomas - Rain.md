Rain and snow are one, the same,
Rain drops and snow crystals fall,
Into the great day of the sun, unpicking, revealing,
Every element alive, not dead:
Until the great night sealing ends the day.

Where wood and hills strong winds sweep,
The cloven coupled shine of the stars,
Into the valleys deep, through the heights of sky,
In the end there is no end, truth is a grain,
Much old is new again.
            What we are, we are.

- Dylan Thomas
