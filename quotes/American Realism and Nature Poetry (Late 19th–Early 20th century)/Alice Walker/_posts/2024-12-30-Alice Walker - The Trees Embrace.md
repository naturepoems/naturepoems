There is a tree
standing proud and tall,
a witness to centuries,
roots deep and branches wide,
where birds find sanctuary,
a home among the leaves.

In its shade, I sit,
the whispers of leaves
speak of ancient truths,
reminding me to breathe,
to be present,
as the sun filters through,
a quiet illumination,
a moment suspended in time.

This tree calls to me,
a friend, a guide,
a living testament
to all that is good,
all that is possible,
in the embrace of nature’s arms.

- Alice Walker
