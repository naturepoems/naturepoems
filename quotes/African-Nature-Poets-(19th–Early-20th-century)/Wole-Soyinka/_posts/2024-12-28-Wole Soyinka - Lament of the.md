Lament of the Earth
O Earth, my mother! My cries ascend,
To the skies, where shadows blend,
With the chants of the leaves, the rustling sands,
And the voices of creatures, in myriad bands.

What have we done to your green and gold?
In the grasp of greed, your heart grows cold,
As we strip your beauty, your sacred grace,
Ignoring the signs of your weary face.

O, toil of tribe, the clash of the bold,
The cries of your children, left in the fold,
Yet, still you shelter, with open palms,
Hoping in silence for the return of balms.

In the dawn of rebirth, let life await,
Let our harmony flourish and erase the fate.
In the arms of the wild, we must find our peace,
To reclaim and consort—our sacred release!

- Wole Soyinka
