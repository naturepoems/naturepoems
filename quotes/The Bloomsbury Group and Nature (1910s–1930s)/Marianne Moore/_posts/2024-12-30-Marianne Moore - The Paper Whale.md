The Paper Whale

Who does not wonder?
Upon rotating clarity perhaps conferring  
Such charms spell upon men  
Plentitude’s folding clarion's call!

Is there a notable softness?
The shadows formed by lustrous surfaces
Meet together fluidly  
As water falls and returns, never
Halfunda, always crisp but gentle,
Speaking a term long and all obscure.

A creature can continuously dart
Yet holding distance with you  
As we drink on shining foam.


- Marianne Moore
