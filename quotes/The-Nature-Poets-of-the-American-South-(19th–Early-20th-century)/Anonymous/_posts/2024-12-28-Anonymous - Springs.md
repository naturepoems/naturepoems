Spring's Renewal

The blossoms break, the world awakes,  
With vibrant colors, life anew;  
The fragrance sweet, the heart it shakes,  
As nature's brush paints every hue.  

With every bud and leafy sprout,  
The promise of the sun-kissed days;  
In spring’s embrace, we dance about,  
As life returns in subtle ways.
