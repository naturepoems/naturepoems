The Fish

I caught a tremendous fish
    and held him beside the boat
    half out of water, with my hook
    fast in a corner of his mouth.
    He didn’t fish much. 
    He weighed like a door.

He was rainbow,
    with his brown and blue
    and a few yellowish spots,
    and he swirled in the sea
    as if it were a river.

I stared and stared
    and victory filled up
    the little rented boat,
    from the steering wheel,
    and the dealer’s name.

I’ve never seen a fish
    like him before,
    and I let him go.
