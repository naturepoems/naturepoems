Mountains rise like ancient gods,  
Veiled in mist and mystery,  
Their peaks a canopy to clouds,  
Guarding sacred history.

Streams that trickle down the slopes,  
Cardamom and cinnamon grace,  
With each drop, a melody flows,  
Nature’s hymn in wildest space.

Ode to the stone and soil below,  
Rugged paths where journeys start,  
The wilderness, a fiery heart,  
Awakening the soul to grow.

- Andrej Ērgļs
