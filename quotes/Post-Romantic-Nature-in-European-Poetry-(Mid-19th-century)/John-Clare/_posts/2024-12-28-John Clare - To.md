To Autumn

Come, gentle autumn, with your ripened feast,
With apples, gold, and hues of copper bright;
In the harvesterâ€™s hands, your song released,
The fields, adorned with amber, pure delight.

With every leaf that falls, a memory,
Of summer's breath now softly laid to rest;
In your embrace, I find eternity,
A tranquil heart, in nature truly blessed.

- John Clare
