I lift mine eyes unto the hills,

As all my tears my heart doth spill;

Upon thy blooms with fragrance sweet,

The dews they shed, my soul's retreat.

With every leaf in its bold sway,

I find the strength from day unto day;

With bees that hum on night's soft field,

In silence through the lights I yield.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
