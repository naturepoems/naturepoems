Birdsong

Rising early with the sun,  
The melodies have just begun,  
As feathered friends take stage and play,  
Their notes a welcome to the day.

Each chirp, each trill, a tale to tell,  
Of dawn's soft light, of morning's spell,  
In harmony, they weave and fly,  
A tapestry across the sky.

Oh, gentle song, so sweet and clear,  
It fills my heart with nature's cheer,  
In every note, I find my peace,  
As bird and soul unite, release.

- Margaret Munro
