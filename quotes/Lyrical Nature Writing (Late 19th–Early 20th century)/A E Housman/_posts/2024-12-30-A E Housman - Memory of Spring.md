MEMORY OF SPRING

The memory of spring I treasure still,  
As blooms awaken from their slumber deep;  
The fragrance lifts my heart, the soft wind’s thrill  
In every secret place where shadows creep.

When petals fall and colors fade away,  
Each glimpse a token of our days gone past;  
Yet in my heart, the promise of the May,  
Will whisper softly, joys that ever last.  


- A E Housman
