The Sea

The sea, in rhythmic embrace,
Breathes deeply, resting among shores,
Where the waters reflect the hues of the sky,
And tides shift, pulling with delight;
In love's bedridden, rocking merge,
The salty winds caress the sands,
Irresistibly, each wave a message,
Softly whispering secrets of the deep.

- Marianne Moore
