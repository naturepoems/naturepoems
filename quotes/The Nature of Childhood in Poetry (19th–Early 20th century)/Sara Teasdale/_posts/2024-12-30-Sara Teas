The Sweetness of Nature

There is a sweetness in the hush of evening,
   A calm where stars wild flicker from above;
Each breath, the breeze of calmness, they are weaving,
   And softening each heart's glow with thought of love.
The grasses plunge in dew like a summer’s kiss,
   Each flower alerts in a flag against the sky;
The world now stands both still and bliss,
   Where dreams like leaves touch all who pass by.
So let the night make clear the path I go,
   And hold the warmth of all that I might need,
For here, in nature’s grace, joy’s fire will glow,
   And set the heart at peace to early deed.

- Sara Teasdale
