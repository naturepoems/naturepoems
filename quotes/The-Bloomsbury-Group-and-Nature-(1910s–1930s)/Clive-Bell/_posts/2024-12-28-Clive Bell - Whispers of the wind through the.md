Whispers of the wind through the trees,
A symphony played with elegant ease.
Nature speaks in a thousand ways,
In vibrant colors, the sun’s warm rays.

Each flower blossoms, a story to share,
Of love and life, beyond compare.
In the heart of the woods, where silence sings,
We discover the joy that nature brings.

- Clive Bell
