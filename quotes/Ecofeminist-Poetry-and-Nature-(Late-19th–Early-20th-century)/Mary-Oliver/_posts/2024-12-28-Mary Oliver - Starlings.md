Starlings

I saw a flock of starlings
last week, wheeling and diving,
all heart and eye,
shadows scattered on the lake.

There were a thousand of them,
or more,—or there might as well
have been, for all how they spilled
toward the ground,
at God’s bidding.

They tested the weight of new sky,
each one waiting for the next,
it was glorious.

And for a moment, my heart pulsed
with their joy;—a simple songs
and a breaking free.
