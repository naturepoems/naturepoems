When the winter frost wraps the earth,
And the world lies still, awaiting rebirth,
The silent strength in the icy still,
Shows the resilience of nature’s will.

Each crystal flake a fleeting star,
Reminding us of how blessed we are,
In the hush of the cold, there’s a promise made,
That spring will return, and all fears will fade.

- Robert Bob O Lockhart
