Dawn

The dusk has come,  
doubling the sun,  
a fleeting, floating thing  
that turns light into silence.  
An entire night presides  
in its cruelty and sweetness —  
see how the creatures move  
to break free from the mantle.  

But morning hides in shadows,  
awaiting throbbing echoes,  
as trembling bodies find  
a perfect dance for peace.  
In the depth of the dawn  
I find  
weeds outlined like a melody mixed  
with the fog around the hill,  
as being there,  
a symphony —  
nature in a gathering of scars.

- Gabriela Mistral
