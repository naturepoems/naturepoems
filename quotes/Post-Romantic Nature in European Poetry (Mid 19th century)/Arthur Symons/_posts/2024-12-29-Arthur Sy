The Rain

The rain falls soft upon the ground,
  A gentle kiss from skies above;
  It sings a sweet, familiar sound,
  A lullaby of hope and love.

And in its touch, the earth awakes,
  As life renews with every drop;
  The world refreshed, no longer aches,
  In natureâ€™s heart, we find the stop.

- Arthur Symons
