Hymn to Youth

O Youth! thou art a very good thing,
    Though it be a little mad. 
I walk in the shadow of gentle flowers.
    And I walk in a light and I am glad! 
What nice things the sunlight has filled
    For me upon the river’s banks! 
I feel it is bright above my dreams,
    This sweetness, and the lovely drifts of thanks.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
