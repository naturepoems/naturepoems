Above the Sea

Above the sea, the clouds apply  
The softest veils, of silver hue;  
And as the sun sinks slowly nigh,  
A golden lens brings forth the blue.  

The waves that kiss the silent shore  
Are spirits from an endless dream;  
They arc, they surf, they roll, and soar,  
Lost in the gold and blue’s sweet scheme.  

And as their laughter glistens bright,  
I feel a peace within my heart;  
For in their dance of day and night,  
The sea and sky will never part.
