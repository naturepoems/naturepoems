In the night of the mountain
in the morning of the sea
I stood and closed my eyes to
what comprises our life.
Wherever we feel the deep river
we are troubled...
I walked the winds
and cried to the stars
my deep heaven.

But I had to come back.

Soon the night will lie
between us,
and I will say
that the snow is deep in this place.
I remember now; I have 
returned and have tried to say
my words.

The birds must speak
and the fields give answer
with their colors before me.

Is this the freedom that is mine?

- Muriel Rukeyser
