A Visiting Day

O Nature! Ellen’s a full day in the garden,  
Upon a carmine couch hung with flowers.  
She weeps with only remembrance,  
A tale to tell, and beyond twenty powers.

Yet looking by her side  
The earth often melts in drops of dew;  
A reasoning beat through  
The dusk, the silent fields,
To bid good night!  


- Matthew Arnold
