Nature, with your artistic hand,
You mold the earth and shape the sky,
In every grain, in every sand,
Breathes the pulse of life, a gentle sigh.
The mountains rise with timeless grace,
The rivers flow, a sacred trace,
A masterpiece, where we belong,
In nature's heart, we find our song.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
