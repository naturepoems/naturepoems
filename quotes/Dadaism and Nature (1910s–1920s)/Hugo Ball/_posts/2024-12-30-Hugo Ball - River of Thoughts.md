River of Thoughts
A river flows through the valley,
Its current a silver laugh,
Fingerlings dart below
the shimmering surface,
As clouds weave their way,
Softly across the blue canvas.

At the riverside, tales of birds dance,
In flocks, they jubilate,
Wings generating colors,
Each beat a heartbeat in flight.
Time slips through our fingers,
Like grains of the sunlit sands.

- Hugo Ball
