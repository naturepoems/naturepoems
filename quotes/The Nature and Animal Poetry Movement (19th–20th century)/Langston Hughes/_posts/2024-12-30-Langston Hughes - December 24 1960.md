December 24, 1960

I want to be a poet,
But I am a rock.
I want to be a river,
But I am a stone.

I want to be the wind,
But I am a wall.
I want to undulate,
But I am not the sea.

I want to be a giant,
But I am a speck.
I want to be all,
But I am none.

And when the sun is setting,
I hear a voice that sounds like age
Calling my name,
And I, a shadow,
Call back—
I want to be a poet.

- Langston Hughes
