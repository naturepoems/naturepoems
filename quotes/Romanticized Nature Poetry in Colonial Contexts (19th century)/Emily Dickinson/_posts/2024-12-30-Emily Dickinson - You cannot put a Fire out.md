You cannot put a Fire out—  
A Fire out—of Fire!  
In yellow tunic, laughter fits  
A failing honest mark to rise!  

For Reach—I could have fanned  
That younger child—  
Mother, take a creature sweet  
And turn again—behold  

What tamed—what clearly lives,  
He touches high—  
These creatures do partake  
As Sons and Daughters shine!  
*You cannot put a Fire out*

- Emily Dickinson
