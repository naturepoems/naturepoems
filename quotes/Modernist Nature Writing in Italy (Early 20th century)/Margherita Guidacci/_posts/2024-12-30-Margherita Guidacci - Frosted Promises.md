Frost thickens the air,
a crisp terror clings to trees,
yet beneath all this,
life holds its breath,
a promise suspended in silence.

Nature wraps her hands
around the barren earth,
vows to return,
in colors more vibrant,
a renewal of promises,
a painting paused,
waiting for the artist's touch.

- Margherita Guidacci
