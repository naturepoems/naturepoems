The Vision of the Maid of Orleans
Was it the wind that swept the field,
With the wave of thy foe, oh Maid of France?
Will we see thy song in glory yield
To the rush of the Horde, the gallant dance? 

Thou hast steel'd the valor of man, yet still,
The pulse of thy life beats timid and faint;
For thou art a child of the valley's thrill,
Innocent, pure, and free from taint.

May the sky unveil its wings of light,
And the woodlands whisper a soothing song;
Let the heart of the world in the soft twilight
Embrace the glories that to thee belong.

- Robert Southey
