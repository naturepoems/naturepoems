The Sea

The ocean is a heart,
beating its relentless rhythm,
a deep blue tapestry,
a cradle for dreams and wreckage.

Waves crash, a constant dance,
a dialogue of water and stone,
each frothy embrace, a whisper of love,
each retreat, a longing sigh.

The salt in the air, a memory,
a taste of freedom upon the lips,
watch as horizons blend,
where sea meets sky in eternal
promiseâ€”of journeys yet unveiled,
and the beauty of returning home.

- Polia de Montalcini
