The Tuft of Flowers
I went to turn the grass once more,
And post the new-plowed field,
A beautiful tuft of flowers by the edge of the cornfield.
Just as the young men flinging weed
Were changing in their summer light.

I looked upon them with gladness;
The flowers were the warmest colors,
And every stem still bore a sweetness;
. . . 

Farmers' life is lonely, solitary;
Less often have I been so alone
Than as when the road, so long and winding,
Brought me to the tuft of flowers, bright and sweet like home.

As I turned back in time to take
The lovely warmth back with me,
For everything will be better, said I.
Still jesting, knowing well it is up to me.

- Robert Frost
