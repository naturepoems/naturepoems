Song of the Scented Lakes  
The scented lakes spread  
As pale reflections,  
First as whispers,  
Then booming resonances  
That echo the mysteries  
Of the deep skies above.  

Each wave is a long sighâ€”  
A perfume carried  
By the lingering wind;  
And as it turns back  
To the mountains,  
It gathers secrets  
In its shallow shores.  

So speak the waters,  
Deep with silence,  
So dark with all that matters;  
I follow the breath  
Of the tide;  
I slip in, unbroken  
By the weight of the world.

- David Gascoyne
