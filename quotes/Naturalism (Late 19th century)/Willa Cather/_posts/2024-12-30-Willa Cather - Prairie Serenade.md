Upon the prairie, wide and vast,
Where clouds chase the sunlight, shadows cast,
The grasses sway gentle, a rhythmic embrace,
Natureâ€™s own canvas, a grand, open space.

Stars sprinkle the midnight in shimmering threads,
While crickets serenade where the night gently spreads.
In this boundless expanse, where freedom takes flight,
The soul finds its solace in the hush of the night.


- Willa Cather
