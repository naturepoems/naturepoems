After a Storm

The lilies sway by the crumbling board,
And how the lily is kissed by the mire!
The water glistens down the deep,  
And over the edge of the vale they would creep.

But dreaming, peering after light,
They rippling run away and away,
The wildness of the water near,
And breezy hills invite me down  
To gather scattered bloom and playing cheer.

Yet in secret I will wait with you,  
By all the blooms and earth-torn paths:
Awake the flowers I always knew  
And leaves lost in the fall — and half my heart, is lost  
But when I touch the glimmer by and by, 
And find a wild butterfly,  
I smile their worth, yet wait for dawn’s reply!

- Dorothy Parker
