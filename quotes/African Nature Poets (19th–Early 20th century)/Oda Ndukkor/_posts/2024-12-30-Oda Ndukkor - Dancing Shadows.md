Dancing Shadows
Beneath the trees, shadows sway,
In the rhythm of the leaves' ballet.
Sunlight dapples the forest floor,
Whispering tales of days of yore.

Creatures scurry, swift and shy,
As nature's orchestra plays nearby.
Crickets chirp, a soothing song,
In this wild place where I belong.


- Oda Ndukkor
