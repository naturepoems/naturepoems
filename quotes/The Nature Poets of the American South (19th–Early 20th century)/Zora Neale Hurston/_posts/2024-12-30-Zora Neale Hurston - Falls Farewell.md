Within the fiery hues of fall,
In rustling leaves, I hear the call.
The crisp air dances ‘round my feet,
In nature’s arms, my soul's retreat.

Each season turns with stories spun,
Of battles fought, of victories won.
In nature’s course, I find my way,
In every dawn, a brand new day.


- Zora Neale Hurston
