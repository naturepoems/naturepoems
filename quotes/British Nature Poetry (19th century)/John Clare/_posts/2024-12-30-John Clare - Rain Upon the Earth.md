A gentle rain is falling slow,
   And every leaf is kissed anew,
The fields are bright, the rivers flow,
   All Nature stands in fragrant hue.

The drops they shimmer like the dew,
   And birds in song sing sweet and clear,
The world awakes as if it knew,
   That every heart can grow sincere.

- John Clare
