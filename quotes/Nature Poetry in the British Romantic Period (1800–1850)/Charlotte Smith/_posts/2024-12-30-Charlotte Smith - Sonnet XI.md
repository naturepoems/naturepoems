Sonnet XI,
   by Charlotte Smith

Thou brightening Moon! how softly dost thou smile  
Upon the earth when day has said goodbye;  
In tender tones, I sense my heart beguile  
Within thy warmth, as shadows drift on high.  

This night, I’ll stand beneath your watchful glow,  
While breezes bear the scent of gentle flowers;  
And muse in dreams where tender visions flow,  
Eclipsed by thoughts of time's eternal hours.

- Charlotte Smith
