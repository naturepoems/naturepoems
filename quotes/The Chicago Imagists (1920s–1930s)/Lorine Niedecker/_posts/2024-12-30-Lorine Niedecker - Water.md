Water

I am water.
I stand still, 
   in mossy shallows and 
 ripples creek-like.
I grow old in you,
   as the lilies bend.

Crows sit on the stone,
   tremble back,
   and glance down too.
      How long did I wait? 
For stars to pass over,
   for branches of leaves -

All in cadence, like a forest.
New light bends across my face.
A tide, a current, a wave,
   to keep me flowing.

- Lorine Niedecker
