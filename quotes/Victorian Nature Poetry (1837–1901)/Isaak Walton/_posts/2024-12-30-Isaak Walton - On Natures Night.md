Even in the long winter nights,
  The stars can keep me company,
  O’er the wide world when I am lost,
  Ah! their soft light is like the sea.

And silence, too, shall provide an ode,
  While the moon looks down and weaves,
  The tranquil beams across the road,
  With dreams like softly falling leaves.

- Isaak Walton
