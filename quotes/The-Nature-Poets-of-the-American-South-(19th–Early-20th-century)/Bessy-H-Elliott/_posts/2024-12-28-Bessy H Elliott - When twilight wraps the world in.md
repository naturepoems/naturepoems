When twilight wraps the world in dreams,  
And crickets play their serenades,  
The last red glow, a soft red beam,  
Fades gently in the leafy glades.  
I journey forth, where shadows blend,  
With nature's charm, my only friend;  
Through sylvan paths, down winding ways,  
I find my peace in end of days.

- Bessy H Elliott
