The seasons turn their endless wheel,
And every leaf, a story told,
In every bloom, a truth we feel,
As life unfolds in hues of gold.

Let hours melt like morning dew,
In nature’s arms, find where you stand,
For every step reveals the new,
When walking through this wondrous land.

- Henry David Thoreau
