A Florida Blue Jay
O, little blue songster drenched in might,
  Your colors vast, a sunlit spree;
Do you know that there is joy in twilight,
  And deep grass waits, a sight to see?

For as I wander, the woods embrace,
  A blue horizon painted clear,
You fly through bright charm with graceful pace,
  With whispers sweet that near to hear.

- Sidney Lanier
