The Little Boy Blues

Night falls upon the world, dear child,  
The sky, so soft, alight with stars,  
The world holds its breath, while dreaming wild,  
And the moonlight gathers, spinning afar.  

The trees stand tall with whispers low,  
While the wind starts to dance in the midnight’s glee;  
The river cools, and away shall flow,  
All worries hush beneath the silent trees.


- James Weldon Johnson
