The leaves are falling like golden dreams,
In the wake of time's gentle flight;
The soft winds sing to the murmuring streams,
As they dance in the fading light.

Oh, beautiful nature, soft and mild,
Your bounty nourishes all that breathes,
In every corner, on land, on wild,
In the heart of springs, your love weaves.

– George William Curtis
