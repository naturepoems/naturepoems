Sheep Pastures

With burnt-oak, looking out from its ledges,
Over the pasture where shadows creep,
I sat a while with thoughts like hedges,
Where the black sheep fold in a dreamless sleep.

The sun lay low on the long green hill,
Which swells in glory of waves and lines;
Till the twilight gathered the world to still,
And slowly deepened where the river shines.

Oh, dreaming sheep with the stars a-gleamingâ€”
Can your minds reach beyond where the shadows leap?
Though your fortunes sleep, and your thoughts be dreaming,
How rich be the pastures you wander in, deep!

- Wilfrid Wilson Gibson
