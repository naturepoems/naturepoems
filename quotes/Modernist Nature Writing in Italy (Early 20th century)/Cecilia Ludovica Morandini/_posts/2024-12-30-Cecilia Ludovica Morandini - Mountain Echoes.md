Mountain Echoes

In the cradle of the mountains,
where silence reigns supreme,
echoes dance through valleys,
a dialogue between rocks and sky.
Their timeless grandeur,
a testament of strength,
uplifts the spirit,
a call to those who wander.

Clouds weave stories,
draped like veils over peaks,
while the path, a whispering promise,
invites weary souls to explore.
Every stone, a memory:
a fragment of the earth,
a moment of eternity,
forever cradled in timeâ€™s embrace.

- Cecilia Ludovica Morandini
