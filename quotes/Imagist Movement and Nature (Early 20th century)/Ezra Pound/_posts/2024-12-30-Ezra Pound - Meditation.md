Meditation
Earth is dry and little rain is falling,
But legumes and shrub and tree,
The light—a sparkling aspen
Fastened near the sky!
From the minerals hewn from ages planted
We go long days like a bird
Knotting our frail wings
That once grew longest in a tree!
My heart beats through these and words
With a sight of weeping water and the sun’s gold
That bursts through invisibly
From hidden lands brought to the table,
Each moving through the patterned breath.

- Ezra Pound
