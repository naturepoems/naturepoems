In the Garden

A butterfly flits from flower to flower,
   Lingering long at the petals’ edge;
She is not like the rest of us —
   In our lives we cling to the hedge.

The bees go buzzing on their quest;
   Their yellow bodies heavy with toil;
They’re so absorbed in their labor that
   They will never be troubled by spoil.

The fragrance rises like spirits freed,
   And the blooms blush softly dumb;
Yet the loveliest sound is the still retreat,
   When the evening’s breath starts to hum.

Ah, let us stay with these kindly ones,
   The blossoms so tender, supreme;
For here lies all that life can give,
   In the quiet of beauty’s dream.

- Lizette Woodworth Reese
