Over mountains and valleys, the eagle soars high,
A symbol of freedom in the vast, open sky.
With wings spread wide, it glides on the air,
In its flight, I find courage to journey with flair.

The sun rises slowly, igniting the morn,
In the blush of new light, a new day is born.
Nature’s exquisite canvas, forever it turns,
In the heart of the wild, my spirit now yearns.
