In the spring morning,
a newness stirs,
gentle breezes carry
soft notes of awakening,
a whisper, a promise,
a renewal,
a dance of creation,
a Dadaist embrace of the odd.

Petals unfurl in blush,
casting dreams,
in the warmth of sun,
a blanket of colors,
every shade telling tales
of joy, of sorrow,
soaked in existence.

Let me chase the sparkle
of dew on grass,
a shimmering echo
of the night before,
a liquid diamond,
a fleeting hold on time.

Between the thickets,
a path blossoms,
a pilgrimage to wonder,
a journey of heart,
lost in the song
of the world awakening,
a celebration,
a surrender,
a fragment of life,
every breath a gift.

- Alice Toklas
