To a Butterfly
Filmy and gold-hued, it flits and flies,
Oh, joyous herald in the warm sun's glow,
Eniwth the magic of thy tiny eyes,
Bright is thy flight, so free, so sweet, dost thou know? 

Through dew-kissed petals and the fragrant air,
Fluttering with laughter, in sweet blissful play,
Nature's soft whispers, of beauty so rare,
That makes the heart rise and dance in a fray.

O spirit of spring, thy one silent crave,
To dance unfettered with the flow'rs of earth,
Wander and chase as the winds gently wave,
In the warmth of the sun, in a moment of mirth.

- Robert Southey
