Does the sky weep
for the fallen leaves?
Or does it raise
yet another canvas
of stars to crown the darkness?

In the quiet of nights,
dreams dance in shadows
arising from the earth,
a rhythm known only to the stars,
where life unfolds
without a sound,
at the longing of the heart.


- Tadeusz Różewicz
