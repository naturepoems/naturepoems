The woods, the trees with their branches wide,
Invite me further, catch my heart inside.
The bramble bushes reach for me,
Whispering stories the winds carry free.
When sunlight filters through the leaves,
And dances on the ground, it weaves,
An intricate tapestry of gold and green,
A work of art, both pure and serene.

To wander the paths of the untamed land,
Where all is crafted by nature’s hand,
I find my soul among the fern,
With every step, a new lesson to learn.
The beauty of each wildflower's bloom,
Breathes life into shadows, dispels the gloom.
— John Clare
