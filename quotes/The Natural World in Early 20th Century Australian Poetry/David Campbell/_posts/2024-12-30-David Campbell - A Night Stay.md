A Night Stay

The scattering stars where the darkness lies,
  Flowing through the air of the sea.
The spirit of twilight lifts hearts to the high
  With the night gazing down with me.

There! I am high in the sky with the hills,
  Reside on the cusp of the stars,
While the longing wind strips a longing that chills,
  And the night wind wipes away bars.

For here is the calm, full of silences,
  Where the snow fell to rise, fall below,
And the swan keeps the calm as it amounts to its ease,
  Like a night saying yes, let it go.

- David Campbell
