The Seasons

I love the varying seasons,  
With their moods, so bright or drear,  
Joy in the spring, and winter’s  
Calm repose, each month a year.

Blossoms bloom in summer’s air,  
Colors vibrant, a sight to dream,  
Autumn’s whispers softly sigh,  
With golden leaves on a glimmering stream.

Winter’s snow provides a cloak,  
Wrapping the earth in a hushed grace,  
Each season a tale of beauty,  
In nature’s everlasting embrace.

- Lydia Sigourney
