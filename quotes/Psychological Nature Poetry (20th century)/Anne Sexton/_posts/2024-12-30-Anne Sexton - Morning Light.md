I must look up at the sky,
On the edge of dawn,
Where the soft breath of morning stretches,
Tilting the world anew,
Each cloud a promise, each star a question,
Hanging overhead like trouble.
As day breaks open,
I turn toward the sun, still shy,
Into its wideness, its embrace,
Like the wildflowers tossed around in the breeze.
They quiver excitedly,
And I am reminded of the pulse of life,
The earth’s rhythms echoing in silence,
The touch of grace brushing by.
I stretch out my fingers,
To touch what is unseen, but always there—
Forever in bloom, always rushing forward.



- Anne Sexton
