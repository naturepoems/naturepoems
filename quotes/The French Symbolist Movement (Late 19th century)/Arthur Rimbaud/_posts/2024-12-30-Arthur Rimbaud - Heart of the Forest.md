The forest breathes in rustling leaves,
A tapestry of green and gold;
Sunlight dances through branches,
In this secret world untold.

Each step upon the forest floor,
Is a prayer to the ancient trees;
Their wisdom flows in rivers deep,
In every rustle, every breeze.

Come, wander through this sacred space,
Embrace the wild, the untamed heart;
Nurture the spirit of nature's grace,
For in its arms, we shall not part.

- Arthur Rimbaud
