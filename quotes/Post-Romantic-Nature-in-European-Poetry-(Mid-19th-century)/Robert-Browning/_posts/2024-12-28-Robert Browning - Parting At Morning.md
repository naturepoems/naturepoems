Parting At Morning  
  
    Round the cape of a sudden came the sea,  
    And the sun looked through  
    To the grass and dew;  
    I went to the world,  
    It buzzed cheerfully.  
 
    And when the great sadness arose in the trees,  
    I sensed  
    Earth’s symphony—  
    Nature came, a friend,  
    Winged as the dreams in flight,  
    The air stirred gently,  
    I took my leave, it’s light.  


- Robert Browning
