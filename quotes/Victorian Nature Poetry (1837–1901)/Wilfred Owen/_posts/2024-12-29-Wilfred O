The Sentry

I was not there, but I could see,  
The sentry clustering under rain-dark eaves;  
Across the street, movements of ghostly leaves  
Were beating faintly beneath again.

His heart a ruptured star, his dreams dispersed,  
He battled through silence; he held his thirst  
By listening to the gradual rhythm  
That rouses in delicate winds the soothing hymn.

Ears open—he stood under the sky of war  
Seething in shadows offered like priceless stars.  
The darkness of days, pitched in anguish, will bloom;  
The clouds unfurl their heaven, bound and groomed.

Such shadows dance, drip beyond our lips,  
For memories echo in landscapes unbound—  
And each heartbeat is a silence, safe  
Dreamers grow distant ‘till deaths engage,  
Eternity unfolds in air-brush hear.  

Around the edges of slaughter we huddle.  
Were dawn, but pallor destroys every color,  
Will we not tread softly upon these graves;  
The whispers of walling hazel caress  
The fading echoes, and the stone that fears.

- Wilfred Owen
