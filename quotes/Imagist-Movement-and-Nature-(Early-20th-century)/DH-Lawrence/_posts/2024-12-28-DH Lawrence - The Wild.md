The Wild Flower
  
The wild flower blooms
In the wild places,
Where the heart of nature
Holds its sweet secret.  

With courage it springs,
In laughter it shines brightly,
No hedge, no fence can keep
Its vibrant spirit at bay.

A brave splash of color,
A wild touch of grace,
In a world caught up
With its own hollow space,
It sings an ancient song,
Of freedom, of growth.

                         - DH Lawrence
