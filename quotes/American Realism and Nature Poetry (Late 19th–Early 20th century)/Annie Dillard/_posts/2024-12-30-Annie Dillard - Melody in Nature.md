I walked a narrow path,
Each step a deliberate note,
The world around me alive,
The harmony of life thrumming.
Here is the essence of time,
Slowly unfurling, revealing.
I carry this song in my heart,
A melody from the wild,
Echoing softly, casting its spell—
I am one with this unfolding world.

               – From "Melody in Nature"

- Annie Dillard
