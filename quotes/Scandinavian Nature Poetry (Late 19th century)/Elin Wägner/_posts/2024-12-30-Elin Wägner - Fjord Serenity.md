The icy fjord reflects the night,
In tranquil silence, stars so bright.
The Northern lights, they flicker hues,
A dance of magic, born anew.

The crisp air bites, yet comforts too,
In solitude, the heart finds view;
Among the cliffs, where spirits pine,
In nature’s cradle, all is divine.

- Elin Wägner
