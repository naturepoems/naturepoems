The Spring Awakes
Beneath the thaw
of stretching skies,
Earth's pulse awakens
in the soft caress
of budding blooms.

Colors drippy,
a canvass of life,
weave through murmurs
of rivers' rebirth,
echoing euphoric breaths
of things to come, 
a promise to be.


Night's Velvet Canvas
Under velvet cloak,
stars uncuff the night,
a symphony of whispers
across the sky's expanse.
The birds retire,
cradled among the boughs,
while moons cast shadows
on the lion-hearted pines.

Crickets sing,
a orchestra of serenity
in the meadow's embrace,
where petals fall like dreams,
woven into the fabric,
light only knows.


Rain's Serenade
Listen—
the earth drinks
as rain lifts its voice,
a serenade
on thirsty soil.
Each drop, a heartbeat,
a promise of life,
from heavens unfold,
as rivers blur
beneath the joyous ballet.

Nature's laughter
fills the air—
a rhythm in motion,
hallelujah moments dancing
within the puddles,
a mirror of the sky’s delight.


The Dance of Autumn
Amber whispers,
swaying trees,
dance to the hymn
of a cooling breeze.
Leaves tumble, twirling,
with grace they fall,
a mosaic painting
on nature’s hall.

In every amber whisper,
in every fading light,
a promise lurks,
a coming night.


Winter’s Breath
In the shiver of dawn,
each flake a ghost,
frost entwines
with the dreamers' toast.
Silent, it settles,
a quilt upon the ground,
a blanket of solace,
a peace profound.

The stillness speaks
in hushed tones,
nature's lullaby
for the wandering souls,
come to take refuge
in the silent cold, 
a sanctuary sacred,
a story untold.


The Mountain’s Gaze
Towering titans in gray,
whispering winds
in my hair,
a moment lingers,
a sacred prayer.
The world beneath,
a canvas vast,
where shadows gulp
and eagles cast.

Every rock,
every trace of snow,
a testament,
yet one must go.
Climb the heights,
dare the fall,
the mountain's majesty,
a beckoning call.

- Vincent Pieter
