quote: "The Rose of the World
The rose of the world is the rose that we are in,
And we each hold in our heart,
In our hands this rosewood made immortal,
The scent of its breath in echo.
That is how we are together in this, 
In a wild, soft wind rising the sound of its song—
That is how we can bask in its golden glow
And vanish into sun or moon's perfumed air.
Live on as we wish, each flower wild, noble, silent of what they dream,  
The power of wind proceeds still at last. 
What are we not made of, as well as these?"

The Rose of the World
The rose of the world is the rose that we are in,
And we each hold in our heart,
In our hands this rosewood made immortal,
The scent of its breath in echo.
That is how we are together in this, 
In a wild, soft wind rising the sound of its song—
That is how we can bask in its golden glow
And vanish into sun or moon's perfumed air.
Live on as we wish, each flower wild, noble, silent of what they dream,  
The power of wind proceeds still at last. 
What are we not made of, as well as these?
