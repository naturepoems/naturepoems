To a Water Lily

I.
To thee, O Sister of the Forest  and the Night,
I sing.

Thou  dost ever bloom  beneath the moist 
  Of hidden wane,  a tender still,
  Bending in the murmuring tide;
A petal soft as sand,
Nestling within the leafy press,
With a heart that should unfold and burst,  like 
The voice of angels sent to bless.

II.
O! The tender sighing odors of thy brook-wash’d stem,
  The glimmer in the depths of thee,
  O! The lisping murmur of the tide.

I have  sought in every place
The bliss which is not mine,
But it seems to mock  my oftest dreams,
And here, sweet bud, I rest, henceforth intertwining  
  With the  weave of thee.

- Robert Buchanan
