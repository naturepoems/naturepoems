The Pine Tree   
The pine tree stands erect and proud  
Amidst the growing corn,  
With branches wide against the sky  
Its verdant crown adorn.  
By the whispering winds and the laughter of the leaves,  
I hear the ancient voice that weaves  
A tapestry of dreams within  
This stately tree's embrace.

- Joyce Kilmer
