The Forest Floor

Whispers of the trees,
Leaves quiver in rhythmic dance,
Fingers of sunlight
Peel back the shroud of dark,
Casting shadowy patterns,
Where creatures breathe and creep.

Beneath the boughs, a world,
Myriad wonders concealed,
Mushrooms bloom in decay’s arms,
Bark sings tales of forgotten storms.

Spirits of moss cradle,
The bones of the earth,
Reveling in quiet,
Where time stands still, reborn,
Resounding with every sigh,
Nature’s breath, life’s eternal grace.


- Hugo Ball
