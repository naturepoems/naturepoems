The sun is a thousand
suns,
each leaf its own
shine.

The world is a million
worlds,
a place where people
live and find.

The grass knows its
way, and whispers
in your ear,
"See how alive
it all is?"

But it’s the trees
that speak in
the ancient tongue
of the earth,
roots deep and wide
in a ground that
moans with history.

- Ted Berrigan
