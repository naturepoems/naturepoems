There was a boy; ye knew him well, ye cliffs
That frowned o’er Windermere; for him at last
The man was changed to a boy again;
And he had a lovely time on the brink
Of rocks remote, while dashing waves beneath
Despaired of reaching him. There I hung
When youthful zeal was on me; I presumed
To bind my own affections, and take time
To look into the country of the mind.

- William Wordsworth
