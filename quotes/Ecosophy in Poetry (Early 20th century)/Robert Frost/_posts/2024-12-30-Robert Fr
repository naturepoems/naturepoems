Design
I found a dimpled spider, fat and white,
On a white heal-all, holding up the sky;
And the fact was all, but not for its appeal,
A thousand bright-red ants were caroling to try.

The chance that they could tumble upon the skies,
Stitching up a grabbed near strike against the bomb.
In the hollow of all things the sun holds deep,
To lose an eye and break the surface of the summers.

An idle marmot, shy and bent along the sea,
And be as pretty as a pin in just a seed,
Irresistible they may seem
And yield us all the dearest song and treat it foul.

The brackets go to me to err by waste and claim,
But I redeem them with the blaze of sunlight gold.
The contrast lay and offer us the flower wild,
While that vast color seems to veil the streamâ€”and pale.

Oh perish from the palm, should I forget
The cover where they weave their web anew,
To view the shadows we have become in loss,
Not once but twice makes them longer for the rub.

- Robert Frost
