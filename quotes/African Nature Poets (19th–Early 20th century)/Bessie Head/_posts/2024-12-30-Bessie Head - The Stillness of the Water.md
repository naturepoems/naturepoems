THE STILLNESS OF THE WATER  
In the stillness of the water,  
I see the sky bend down,  
Cloud reflections ripple softly,  
As birds come to play  
In the embrace of the stream.  

The gentle sound of footsteps  
On stones smooth and worn,  
Tell the tales of summer  
And promise the autumn’s song  
To come alive in color.  


- Bessie Head
