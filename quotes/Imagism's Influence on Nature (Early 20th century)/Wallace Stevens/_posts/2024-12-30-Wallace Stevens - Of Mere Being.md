Of Mere Being

The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of space,
The palm stands on the edge of the world,
And for better or for worse, a strange red image, terms unborn of a  
Extravagant light,
Leaves off its sounds.

The palm is a palm
That should not lean in that direction.
The palm can shake its leaves,
But does not grow large there.


- Wallace Stevens
