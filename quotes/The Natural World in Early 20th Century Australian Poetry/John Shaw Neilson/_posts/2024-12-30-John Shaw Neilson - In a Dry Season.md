In a Dry Season

When after weeks of drought I stand
    And view the sunburnt land,
I think of all the flowers that sleep
    Beneath the world so deep.

Yet I can see the mirage play,
    And feel the thirsty day;
But hope will bloom when the rain does fall,
    And awaken flowers to call.

- John Shaw Neilson
