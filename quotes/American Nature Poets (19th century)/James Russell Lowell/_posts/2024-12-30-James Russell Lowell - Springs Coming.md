The coming of spring brings energy anew,
  In nature's jest, with life to pursue,
So let us cast worries with winter's despair,
  And dance with joy as the sun climbs high in air.

For spring nurtures bloom and spark in the dust,
  With every droplet brings forth new trust,
So amid the verdant growth, let revelry wend,
  Natureâ€™s heart pulsates, and the day has no end.

- James Russell Lowell
