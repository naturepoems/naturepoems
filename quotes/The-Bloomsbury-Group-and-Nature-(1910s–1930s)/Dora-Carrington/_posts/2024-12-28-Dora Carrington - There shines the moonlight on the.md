There shines the moonlight on the grove,
Where silver beams above do rove,
I watch the shadows glide and sweep,
As gentle hills around me sleep.
Untouched by time, the silent charms
Of Nature hold me in their arms,
And as the air doth dance some waltz,
Each lingering touch inspires halts.

My soul doth weave with light and sound,
In harmony, I’ve lost the ground,
For in the lea of summer’s grace,
I find the bond to nature’s embrace.
In every leaf, a story flows,
In each soft breeze, potential grows,
I am but part of this pure heart,
An endless drift, where life doth start.

- Dora Carrington
