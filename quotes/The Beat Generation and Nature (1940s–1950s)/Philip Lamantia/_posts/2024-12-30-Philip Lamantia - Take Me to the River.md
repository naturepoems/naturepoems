Take me to the river,
      my love,
to plunge your cheeks
        in sparrowed winds
like the kindling over
                   our bared souls.

Where the blossomed trees
        sing their purple song
and the sifting crickets
         echo the pain
of our twin hearts 
             bound by silence.
