The moon is a white bird
that flies through the night,
flapping the wings of the wind.

It settles down to roost
in a tree of dark shadows,
whispering secrets to the stars.

I watch it take flight,
feathered with silver light,
soaring high above the earth.

What does it see,
this creature of night,
who moves between worlds,
light and dark?
