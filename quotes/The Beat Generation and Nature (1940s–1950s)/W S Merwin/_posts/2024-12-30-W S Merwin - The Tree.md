The Tree

This tree that stands
   in the middle of nowhere
holds both summer
   and winter in its branches,
promises greeting,
a breath of new life
   in every season.

I spend my nights
beneath its shadow,
   listening to stories
in the rustled leaves,
each whisper
years of waiting.


- W S Merwin
