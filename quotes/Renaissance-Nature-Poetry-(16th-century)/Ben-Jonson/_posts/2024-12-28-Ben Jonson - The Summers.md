The Summer's Day
When summer days are spread to bless our heart,
And nature breathes her fruits in golden light,
Each whisper from the leaves plays nature's part,
With patterns soft in every shade and sight.

The sun, a king upon the azure throne,
Calls forth the warmth to wake the vibrant bloom;
While gentle breezes in the twilight groan,
Carry the scents that swoon through evening's gloom.

Let me lie down upon the verdant grass,
And dream beneath the sheltering of skies,
For in this world, where beauty flows, I pass,
In nature's arms, my spirit freely flies.

- Ben Jonson
