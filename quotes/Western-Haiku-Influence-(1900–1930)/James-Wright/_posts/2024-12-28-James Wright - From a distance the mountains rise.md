quote: "From a distance, the mountains rise, 
Veiled in mist, a dance between foreground and sky, 
I pluck a feather from the earth— 
It sings of the freedom that I seek, 
Once again lost in the quiet embrace of pine."

From a distance, the mountains rise, 
Veiled in mist, a dance between foreground and sky, 
I pluck a feather from the earth— 
It sings of the freedom that I seek, 
Once again lost in the quiet embrace of pine.
