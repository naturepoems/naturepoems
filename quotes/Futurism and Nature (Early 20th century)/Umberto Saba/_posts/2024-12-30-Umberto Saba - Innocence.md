Under the vast expanse of the sky,
Clouds drift like dreams, buoyant and free,
Casting shadows on the world below,
A soft reminder of life’s gentle plea.

In the distance, a child’s laughter rings,
The sound dances with the breeze,
They chase after the wind, in pure delight,
Frolicking as the heart learns to seize.

Nature, a canvas painted with joy,
Each moment an echo of what it could be,
In the simplicity of a day spent in play,
We find wisdom in the wild, eternally free.

- Umberto Saba
