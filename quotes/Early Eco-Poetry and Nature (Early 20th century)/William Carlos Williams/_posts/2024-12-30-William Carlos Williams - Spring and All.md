Spring and All.

II

through the forest

of the valley, the

orange blossom and the

scent of flowers

who wait in season,

and the thick

of it, the blue of it,

the air stirring, ask,

a thing of which is
shown,

the young black
trees, and of the

sky lowering through the

green,

where are the

birds.  And

pursue them that
they may come,

green/color/earth,

turn round and through the

trees again, flying

back to the orange
blossom of spring.
