---

The morning wind spreads its wings over the sea and the land,
In the midst of meadows and fields,
Crests up the rivers with sweet murmurs,
And in the branches of trees sings with great plumes,

Awakening all, even the gentlest heart,
To the joy of living and being,
To the loud chorus of the brimming earth,
To the songs of the stream and the wind—

For each leaf of grass and each blue sky,
Will convey me back to purest joy.

— From "Leaves of Grass"

- Walt Whitman
