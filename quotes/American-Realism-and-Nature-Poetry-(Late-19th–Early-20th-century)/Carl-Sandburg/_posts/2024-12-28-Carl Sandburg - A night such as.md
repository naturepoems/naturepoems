---

A night such as this,
each leaf of the trees listens,
an old owl watches,
gathering wisdom from the stillness,
there in the dark,
even silence is a sound,
a hymn given to the stars.

Here lies the peace
that we seek every day,
a whisper on the lips of night.
Come take this beauty,
young and ancient—
this moment of grace,
with you forever.

- Carl Sandburg
