Awake, my soul! to nature’s call,
To winds and leaves that softly fall.
Embrace the day, so bright and clear,
Let every moment sing, my dear.
For time is fleeting; shadows play,
Yet in the light, we find our way,
Through every dream, through every heart,
In nature’s arms, we shall not part.

- Lord Byron
