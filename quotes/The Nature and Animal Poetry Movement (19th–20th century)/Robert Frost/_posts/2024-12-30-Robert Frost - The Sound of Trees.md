The Sound of Trees
I wonder about the trees.
Why do we wish to bear
Forever on our head——
The noise of their leaves
In their natural presence?

I lingered on my way,
With a drunken mind and a light step,
Among them—and stopped to listen—
Once again, and where did I go?

It started to blow away.
While I lingered after the trees
And the whispers took me,
I left the world behind.

But there were voices there too.
The trees whispered softer and softer,
And I'd rather listen,
But my mind was in this world.

Yet trees lift their arms up endlessly,
Their only wish a pure and free
And light noise’ll speak of them so:
Their freedom blowing one with another.

- Robert Frost
