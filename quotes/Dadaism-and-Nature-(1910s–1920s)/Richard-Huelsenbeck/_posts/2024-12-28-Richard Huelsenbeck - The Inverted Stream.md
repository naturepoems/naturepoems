The Inverted Stream  
Beneath the surface of dreams,  
a brook runs wild,  
inverting the world above,  
a fantastical tapestry of colors—  
where fish dance  
like shoals of paper planes,  
as gnarled trees stand watch,  
roots tangled in reverie.

Ripples create apertures  
in reality,  
a glimpse into other realms,  
a float upon the infinite,  
a caress of soft winds  
singing through the daylight,  
a stream of consciousness flowing,  
as nature's voice twists and turns.

- Richard Huelsenbeck
