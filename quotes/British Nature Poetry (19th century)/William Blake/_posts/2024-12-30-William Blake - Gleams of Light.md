Gleams of Light

A light shineth from peak to peak,  
And it whispers beneath the shade;  
With bright dew and dreams that speak,  
In Earth’s green heart, a gentle glade.  

What is found in a moment’s gaze?  
The fireflies dance on glistening wing,  
In nature's woven, silvered maze,  
The morning birds, their praises sing.  

O the trees, how they sway with grace,  
In the arms of the love-sick moon;  
Beneath the stars’ eternal embrace,  
Nature’s song becomes a tune.

- William Blake
