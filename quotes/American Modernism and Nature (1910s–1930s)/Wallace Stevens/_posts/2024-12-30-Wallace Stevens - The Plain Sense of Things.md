The Plain Sense of Things

The plain sense of things
Is that the plain sense of things
Is not sad or glad.
The pale leaves wave as they weave
In the touch of wind, and the fall of rain
On the wind-swept ground reveals
The contours of the earth beneath,
And in the morning light the world is whole.



- Wallace Stevens
