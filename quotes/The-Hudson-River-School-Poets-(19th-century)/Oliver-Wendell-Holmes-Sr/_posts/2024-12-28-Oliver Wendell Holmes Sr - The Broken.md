The Broken Soldier

The soldier, tired through toil and strife,
Seeks peace in the softness of life,
While marble shades in twilight lay,
Mark the lonesome paths, where shades do play.

And let the air, touched with natureâ€™s breath,
Wreathe round his heart, and lull through death,
Where mountains round in shadows rest,
A sigh where he finds a troubled breast.

Yet whisper softly into the night,
Of dreams, of trails the kindling light,
In silence, hear the rustling of grace,
Embracing the spirit, who longs to face!

- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr
