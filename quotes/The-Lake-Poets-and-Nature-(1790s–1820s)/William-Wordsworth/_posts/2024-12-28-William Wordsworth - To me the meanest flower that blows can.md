To me the meanest flower that blows can give  
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.


The rainbow comes and goes,  
And lovely is the rose;  
The moon doth with delight  
Look round her when the night  
Doth, as a silent friend,  
Among the trees descend;  
When we look round, and behold  
The beauty of the world unfold.

- William Wordsworth
