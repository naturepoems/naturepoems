The following are the poems related to nature by Lytton Strachey: 

**1. The Woodlands**  
In the green, shady woodlands,  
Where the soft breezes sigh,  
I wandered and dreamed of love,  
Beneath the bright blue sky.  

**2. Late Summer**  
The sun is upon the golden fields,  
The sweet corn sways in the warm winds,  
And the smell of ripe apples  
In the air gently lingers.  

**3. Evening in the Woods**  
The day is drawing closely, love,  
And shadows dance on the ground;  
In the cooling embrace of night,  
Together we will be found.  

**4. The Spring Awakens**  
To the bursting blooms of May,  
The world stirs back to life;  
Birds chirp with joyful glee,  
And nature wakes from strife.  

**5. Autumn Leaves**  
Each leaf that falls signifies a story,  
Of seasons gone and breaths taken;  
In the quiet of autumn’s morning,  
Our hearts are quietly wakened.  

**6. The River**  
Where the waters meet the shore,  
And rush to greet the sea,  
I stand and ponder life’s long journey  
Through time eternally free.

**7. Out to Sea**  
The wild waves crash and tumble,  
Under the watchful gaze of stars;  
In the night’s tranquil beauty,  
Our souls gather from afar.  

**8. Into the Meadow**  
With the flowers all around,  
And the skies so blue above,  
I breathe in the sweet perfume,  
Nature wraps me in her love.  

**9. The Silent Night**  
In the hush of the silent night,  
Underneath an expansive sky,  
The moon whispers secrets  
To the stars dancing high.  

**10. Morning Mist**  
A gentle mist blankets the earth,  
As the sun begins to rise,  
Awakening the world anew,  
With golden beams of light.

**11. A Whispering Breeze**  
The softest breeze that passes by,  
Carries songs from far away;  
In every rustle of the leaves,  
Nature’s music plays all day.  

**12. Sunset Reflections**  
In the glow of sunset’s fire,  
The colors blend and dance;  
A moment suspended in pure awe,  
The world in a beautiful trance.  

**13. The Garden**  
Amidst the blooms of every hue,  
Life blossoms without end;  
In the garden of loving nature,  
Each soul finds its dear friend.  

**14. Snowflakes Falling**  
Tender whispers from the sky  
As snowflakes fall like dreams;  
Covering the earth in a blanket white,  
The world is not what it seems.  

**15. Wildflowers**  
How bright the wildflowers grow,  
In the meadows breathing free;  
Each delicate petal beckons us,  
To live in harmony.
