A Garden in the Desert
In the desert you will find
moments bursting on the stones,
water may stream over suns,
flowers pushing through
with scent so rich
it fills the air with light,

birds calling out
to the heavens above,
a song that lingers,
In the harshness,
amidst sharp bites of wind,
filling the stillness with life
like colors you once thought lost.


- Lawrence Ferlinghetti
