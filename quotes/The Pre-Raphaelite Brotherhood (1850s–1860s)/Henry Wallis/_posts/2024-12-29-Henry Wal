The mountains stand like giants,
Watching over all they see,
In their arms the forest giants,
Awake in ancient majesty. 

The rivers carve and shape,
Like time's unyielding hand,
Flowing softly through the landscape,
Across the timeless land. 

Oh, to dwell among their heights,
To breathe the mountain air,
Where nature's unblemished sights
Reveal a world so rare!

- Henry Wallis
