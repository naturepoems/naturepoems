In every tree, a story hangs,
Of whispered winds and growing strong.
The leaves that flutter, softly sang,
A melody where hearts belong.

With roots that cradle earth’s sweet core,
And branches reaching for the light,
In nature’s arms, we find the shore,
Where love and life are pure delight.

- Marie de France
