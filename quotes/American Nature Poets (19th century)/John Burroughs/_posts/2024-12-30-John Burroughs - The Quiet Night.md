The Quiet Night

What a balm the night has spun,
With stars like pearls and moon like sun,
Hush all voices, still the air,
Nature sleeps, without a care.

In the canopy of shade,
Where peace and harmony are laid,
In the silence, feel the glow,
Trust the dark where dreams may flow.

- John Burroughs
