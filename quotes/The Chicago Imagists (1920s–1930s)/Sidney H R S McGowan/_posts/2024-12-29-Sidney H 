The River

Down the hill a river runs,
Cascading over stones like ideas,
Bursting forth with laughter,
Whispers of nature's song.
Each bend, a new thought,
Each ripple, a fleeting moment,
Breath of fresh air that carries
The scent of pine and earth.

As sunbeams dapple the surface,
Gold and silver jump like memories,
In this fluid realm of reflection,
Where shadows of clouds dance slowly.
I stand entranced, rooted in the moment,
Nature's brush paints me anew,
With every glance, a fresh vision,
As the river wends its way to the sea.

Cedar Grove

In the cedar grove, time abounds,
Gentle giants whisper ancient tales,
Their needles, soft like secrets,
Catch the light in emerald veils.
A carpet of moss welcomes weary feet,
As streams murmur in harmonious tune,
In this sacred space, life unfolds,
Embracing the gentle kiss of afternoon.

Birdsong weaves a tapestry,
Not just sound, but vibrant hues,
A canvas painted fresh each dawn,
With colors of green, gold and blues.
Here, nature cradles every heartbeat,
In the serene embrace of the trees,
Each breath becomes a prayer,
A stillness that perfectly frees.

Skyward

Look up!
Do you see the promise
In the voluminous stretch of sky,
Clouds drifting like soft thoughts,
Across the canvas of day?
Azure dreams rise and roll,
Each accumulation of vapor,
Kisses of lingering past,
Woven into the tapestry of blue.

Wind dances through the branches,
A playful spirit, untamed and free,
It carries tales of the horizon,
A soft sigh of eternity.
Embrace the majesty overhead,
Where stars watch with knowing eyes,
And contemplate the simple truth—
We are but whispers in the vastness of life.

Sunlit Meadow

Sunlight spills on golden grass,
A patchwork quilt of warmth and glee,
Where wildflowers nod in agreement,
With sweet scents that breathe of ecstasy.
Here, the earth unfolds like laughter,
As the breeze strokes tenderly,
And butterflies flutter in splendor,
Wings dancing with such clarity.

Each blade a story, each petal a word,
Nature speaks without need for sound,
In this sunlit meadow of wonders,
Connection in every heartbeat found.
Take a moment, let your spirit leap,
Join the symphony of the free,
For in this space, we intertwine,
A vibrant tapestry of you and me.

Mountain Whisper

The mountain looms like a sentinel,
Guarding secrets of the wild,
Its voice a mere whisper against the sky,
Yet echoes of history compiled.
Crags and cliffs hold ancient stories,
In every stone, a tale unbound,
Fragrant pines stand sentry,
In this temple where stillness is found.

Listen closely, breathe it in,
The fragrance of earth and stone,
Feel the pulse of timeless grandeur,
In the heartbeat of mountain throne.
Here the world reveals its splendor,
In hues of sunset’s soft embrace,
Awaken to the reverence of nature,
In the silent song of this sacred place.

Autumn Leaves

Look around, the colors blaze,
Autumn’s brush paints passionate shades,
Crimson, gold in every gaze,
Nature’s farewell serenade.
Leaves rustle like whispered goodbyes,
Each flutter speaks of change,
Time to release, let go, and rise,
As the world shifts seamlessly strange.

Capture these moments, fleeting yet bright,
In the coolness that beckons grid,
Reflect on the cycles, the endless flight,
For in every ending, a beginning hid.
These leaves, they dance in the twilight,
Like dreams carried on the breeze,
Embrace this artistry of the night,
As the earth whispers, “Simply seize.”

Starlit Path

In the hush of the sleeping night,
Stars shimmer, echoing wishes bright,
A path lined with cosmic dreams,
We tread lightly on starlit beams.
Moonbeams lace the silent space,
Wrap us in their tranquil grace,
Each step a heartbeat, soft yet clear,
Whispers of the universe draw near.

Feel the cool breath of the night,
As the world dons her cloak of light,
In this serene encapsulation, we wander,
Awestruck by the vastness yonder.
Every twinkling point a spark divine,
Guiding seekers through the infinite line,
Where nature’s essence melds with time—
In this starlit path, the cosmos aligns.

Dawn’s Embrace

Awake!
As dawn spills color on the canvas,
A palette of hope, kissed anew,
Gentle whispers stir the slumbering earth,
In this moment, all feels true.
Birds sing soft melodies of day,
The world unfurls its petals wide,
With each ray, a promise springs,
Inviting the heart to abide.

In the dew-kissed grass, life glimmers,
As sunlight stretches, yawns, and smiles,
Listen to the heartbeat of morning,
Each breath a journey through nature’s miles.
Rise, with the sun, breathe in the light,
Join the dance, feel the spark ignite,
For in each dawn, a chance anew,
To embrace the world, to feel, to view.

Lunar Tide

The moon hangs low in velvet skies,
Casting silver upon the tide,
Waves caress the sandy shores,
In this liquid embrace, dreams bide.
Soft whispers brush against my feet,
As the world melds in shadowed flight,
Ebbing whispers of the ocean’s heart,
Carry solace into the night.

Each crest a tale of the deep,
Each trough a moment in time passed,
In this dance of lunar force,
Eternity’s longing unsurpassed.
Rest upon the tranquil waters,
Let the night wrap you tight,
For the moonlight sings a lullaby,
Guiding your soul till morning light.

Woodland Secrets

Through the canopy, sunlight filters,
In dappled hues of green and gold,
Whispers of the woodland secrets,
Stories waiting to be told.
Leaves rustle, a soft kind of laughter,
As creatures weave through shadows thin,
Each rustling sound a gentle reminder,
Nature's reverie, where life begins.

Mossy carpets cradle our footsteps,
As we meander through nature's embrace,
Every bend shows a new wonder,
Every pause, a tranquil space.
In this sanctuary, hearts connect,
With every breath, we lose the strife,
For here, among the trees, we discover,
The beautiful pulse of living life.

---

Harvest Moon

The harvest moon rises, bold and bright,
Casting shadows across the fields,
Golden grains ripple in the stillness,
As the bounty of nature reveals.
September’s crown, a testament true,
To the labor of hands, day and night,
With each beam of luminous grace,
The earth unveils her heart’s delight.

Gathered ‘round the flickering fire,
With laughter and stories shared,
We celebrate the cycle of life,
In gratitude for how we’ve fared.
For when the moon shines down upon us,
Her silver rays a gentle embrace,
We are reminded of the connectedness,
In this grand journey, in this sacred space.

Whispers on the Wind

Feel the whispers on the wind,
As it carries stories of the day,
Leaves tremble with ancient secrets,
In their rustling, they gently sway.
A tale of mountains and valleys deep,
Of rivers that wander and roam,
In every breeze, a memory stirs,
Calling us back to nature’s home.

Each gust entwines with laughter bright,
Filling the air with serene delight,
In this gentle symphony of sound,
Life dances gracefully all around.
Let the wind embrace your spirit,
Let it take your worries away,
For in its arms, our souls shall soar,
On whispered winds, we find our way.

- Sidney H R S McGowan
