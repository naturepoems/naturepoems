From cliffs that cradle the tempest,
To gentle waves that kiss the shore,
Nature churns its endless marvels,
With chiseled rocks that sway no more.

Soft lilacs spring beneath whispers,
Twisting serenely with the wind,
As clouds weave stories above,
The heavens sigh with palms outstretched.

In every nook, the wild awakens,
Unraveling colors across the land,
And the heart of mankind stands reverent,
Knows its place, a companion hand in hand.

- Stephen Spender
