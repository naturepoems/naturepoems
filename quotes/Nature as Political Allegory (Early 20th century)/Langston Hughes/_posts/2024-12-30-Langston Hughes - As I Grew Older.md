As I Grew Older

It was beautiful, and fitting,
After the melancholy dusk,
That I should walk
In a white field,
And in a black sky—
The memories are still,
Gravitating towards the hearts
That bathe in the soft, fading light,
    And
Just a little twinkle above,
A single star in the dusk of fleeting time.

I grow older, and in the dark,
I grow older still, longing for what was—
Yet, burn in the heart, a living flame.
With the ache of age.

The dusk begins to deepen,
Day is shadowed against the whisper,
The rhythm of a soft heartbeat,
Tell of bright lilacs and violets, rays of sun.
When I reach, but softly,
Yet so clear for all I yearn.

Ah yes, the river's call,
Like the strength of the mountains that hold
In the valleys the cries of night,
Is sweet, prophetic, and near.
.
Time has the ground as it seeks, its secret rhythm,
But even as I grow older, the heart holds tight,
The twilight's shadow must not take my stillness.

—Langston Hughes
