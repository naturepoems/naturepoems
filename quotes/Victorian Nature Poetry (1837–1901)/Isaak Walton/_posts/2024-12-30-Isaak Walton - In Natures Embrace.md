The tranquil glade, the soothing stream,
  A cradle for the weary heart,
  Where hope takes flight and wildflowers gleam,
  In every corner, nature’s art.

Let not the worries of the world,
  Encumber your sweet wandering soul,
  For in the arms of earth, unfurled,
  You’ll find the peace that makes you whole.

- Isaak Walton
