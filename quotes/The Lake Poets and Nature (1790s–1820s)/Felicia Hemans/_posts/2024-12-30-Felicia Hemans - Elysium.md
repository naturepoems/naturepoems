Elysium
Where are the fairest regions wide,
Where the mild winds in summer glide,
And beauty’s drone enchants the heart?
No!—'tis not thence the soul must part.

Let not our spirits seek to flee,
To weave their dreams of liberty;
For it is in the golden glow,
That Nature showers bounteous flow.

- Felicia Hemans
