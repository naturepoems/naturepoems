The Collar

I struck the board, and cried, "No more;  
I will abroad!  
What? shall I ever sigh and pine?  
My lines and life are free;  
And when I bury my crown,  
With all my sins and stains,  
I do but leaf itâ€”  
For with spirits bright and clear,  
Shall I seek the sun.  
This glass mirrors no grieving soul!  
Those graceless hours have all been spent;  
When  hearts have surely bled.



- George Herbert
