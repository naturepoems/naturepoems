In the quiet of the winter snow,
Where silence reigns in purest white,
I find the beauty of letting go,
In natureâ€™s arms, I find the light.

Each flake, a dancer from the sky,
Drifting down with grace and ease,
In this frozen world, I learn to fly,
With every heartbeat, every breeze.

- Sigfried Undset
