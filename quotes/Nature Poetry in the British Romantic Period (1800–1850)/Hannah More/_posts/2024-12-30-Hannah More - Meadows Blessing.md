Upon the banks where daisies bloom,
The sunlit meadows spread their cheer;
Where nature's breath dispels all gloom,
And laughter rings, both bright and clear.

Each petal tells a tale of grace,
Each breeze brings whispers from above,
In every green and quiet space,
The heart may find a well of love.

So come, dear friend, and let's rejoice,
In nature's splendor, sweet and wide;
For amid this beauty, we shall voice,
The gratitude that life provides.

- Hannah More
