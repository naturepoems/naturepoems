The Youth of the Period

Across nature’s stage—and we  
In blazoned light have skies like span;  
But tear as night blows soft and fair,  
So take the pulse of man.  
And in bright nests where waters glide,  
The courage of birds know well—  
And oh, the leaves that whisper pride  
Wing-drawn from hallowed shell!  

What youth shall walk amidst the woods,  
And find the visions fasten bright;  
What echoes claim their splendid days  
When love meets face the haunting night.  
For the tide of the sea streams low,  
And the creature of earth awake;  
But heart in nature stands with glow  
At the brink where wishes rake.


- Matthew Arnold
