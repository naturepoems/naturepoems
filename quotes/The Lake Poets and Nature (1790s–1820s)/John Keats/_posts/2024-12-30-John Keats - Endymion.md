A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
Its loveliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.

Therefore, on this great night, we will toss
Flowers among the stars, we will be wisely gay
While the world exists in the chaos
Of loss and greed, we will feast and play
In the beauty of nature that enchants us still.

For the sun will rise, and the flowers will bloom,
And the rivers will sing, with nature as our tune.

- John Keats
