The Road

Between the trees, a narrow path,  
Winds through the silent air,  
With whispers filling the lonely roads,  
Where shadows dart without care.  

There is a dance of beauty,  
Where the sunlight softly glows,  
And every step in this golden warmth  
Springs hope where nature flows.

- Edward Thomas
