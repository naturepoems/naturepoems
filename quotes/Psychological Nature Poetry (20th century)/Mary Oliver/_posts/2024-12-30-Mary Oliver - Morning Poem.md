Morning Poem

Every morning  
the world is created.  
Under the orange tree,  
I have seen the sun  
dramatic as a firework.  
Let it be a day when I listen.  
I want to remember  
the perfect peace of the morning,  
in the midst of chaos and creation.  
No matter where I have been,  
this day will hold a quiet memory for me.  
The world is calling.  
The sun rises with threads of gold.  
Let me breathe again,  
in all that is lovely;  
life, in essence,  
waits all around me.

- Mary Oliver
