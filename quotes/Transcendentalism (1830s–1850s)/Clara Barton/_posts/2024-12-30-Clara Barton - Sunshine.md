Sunshine

God’s smile on the earth! The universe
Has opened its heart, and the sun
In its joyful glow does disperse
The waste of shadow, which once had run.

A silken thread of golden light
Stitches the gaps of gloomy shade,
While all creation in full delight
Vies to share in the bright parade.

- Clara Barton
