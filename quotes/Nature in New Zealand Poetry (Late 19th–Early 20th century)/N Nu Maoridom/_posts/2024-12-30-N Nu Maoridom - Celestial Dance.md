Celestial Dance

At twilight's call, the stars align,
A cosmic waltz, a grand design,
In every flicker, light and grace,
We dance as one, in nature's space.

With each embrace, the galaxies spin,
Through infinite, where dreams begin,
The universe, in vast expanse,
In every heartbeat, love's sweet chance.

- N Nu Maoridom
