With the wind, I roam,  
Across the fields of gold,  
Where the sun dips low,  
And shadows softly fold,  
Whispering secrets of the day.

The wildflowers nod to me,  
In colors bold yet shy,  
Their fragrant breaths rise high,  
With beauty that cannot die,  
In the warm embrace of the sky.


- George Ripley
