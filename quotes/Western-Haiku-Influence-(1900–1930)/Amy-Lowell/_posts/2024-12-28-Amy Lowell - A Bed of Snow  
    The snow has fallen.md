author: Amy Lowell
quote: "A Bed of Snow  
    The snow has fallen in quiet depths,  
    Each flake a silent prayer.  
    The world is hushed beneath its weight,  
    Wrapped in a blanket rare.  

    I walk through the night,  
    The crunch of crisp white field  
    Is music to my ear,  
    A secret only nature revealed."

A Bed of Snow  
    The snow has fallen in quiet depths,  
    Each flake a silent prayer.  
    The world is hushed beneath its weight,  
    Wrapped in a blanket rare.  

    I walk through the night,  
    The crunch of crisp white field  
    Is music to my ear,  
    A secret only nature revealed.

- Amy Lowell
