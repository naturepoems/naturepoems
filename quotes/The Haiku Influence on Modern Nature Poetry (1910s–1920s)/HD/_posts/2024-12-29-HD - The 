---

The winds hold whispers from trees,
Brushing soft against my inner thoughts;
With each breath I’m drawn among the leaves,
Falling together through the sun’s meek glow,
Follow the echoes, let shadows flicker—
Their conversations catch the colors of time.
I shall tread along with limbs stretched,
Cradled within, where silence keeps my love—
Intertwined in all the green of grace!
And let the silence deepen as we embrace,
The comfort of this earth shall hold.
