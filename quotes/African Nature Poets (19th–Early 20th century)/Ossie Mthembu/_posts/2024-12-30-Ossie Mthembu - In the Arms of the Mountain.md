In the Arms of the Mountain

High above the valley,
The mountain stands so bold,
Its arms outstretched in welcome,
Holding stories untold.

Through the mist and the clouds,
Whispers of the ancients flow,
Each stone tells a secret,
Of the life long ago.

Oh, how I long to climb,
To feel the earth beneath,
In the arms of the mountain,
My spirit finds its wreath.

- Ossie Mthembu
