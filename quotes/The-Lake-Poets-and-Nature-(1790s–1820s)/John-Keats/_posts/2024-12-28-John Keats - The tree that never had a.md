The tree that never had a leaf
Hang in the heart of the earth.
Summer seasons may make us want
To hop like a wish, to wander that way.
Summer, soft but greedy, pries lips of flowers open.

Foliage dreams into sweet, sweet shades; 
Perfumes of a rich, bespeckled plenitude 
Spread their fictile embrace wide.  
Shall close the tree that never knew a leaf?

*Translation calls for a softened list,
Not allowing certain thoughts to roughen the lip. 
This kiss sweetened dreams as the dew,
And wraps them close as dreams do, too.
Something to remind splendour, which ignobles hallowing, 
Over oceans, on hills –
The very view "fields” lean towards.*

- John Keats
