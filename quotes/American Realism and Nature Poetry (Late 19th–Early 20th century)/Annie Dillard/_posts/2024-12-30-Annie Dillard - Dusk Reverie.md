In the silence of dusk,
I watch the sun melt,
The horizon catches fire,
And the stars gleam like promises.
In this fading light, I know,
Life was bright, and still is,
In whispers of wind, in rustling leaves.
I breathe the sacredness of the night.

               – From "Dusk Reverie"

- Annie Dillard
