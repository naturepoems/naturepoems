Rain Dance

The gentle patter on the ground,  
A symphony of nature's sound,  
As rain descends with soft caress,  
A loving touch, a sweet duress.

The earth drinks deep, the flowers rise,  
As clouds, like dreams, in dance surmise,  
In puddles form, reflections play,  
A mirror for the skies’ ballet.

Oh, rain, you bring the earth to life,  
In every drop, a moment rife,  
For in your song, my heart takes flight,  
In every storm, there shines a light.

- Margaret Munro
