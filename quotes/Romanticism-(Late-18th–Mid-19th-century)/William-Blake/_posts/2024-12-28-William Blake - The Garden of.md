The Garden of Love

I went to the Garden of Love,
And saw what I never had seen:
A Chapel was built in the midst,
And the gates of this Chapel were shut,

And Thou shalt not, and Thou shalt not  
Depressed upon a see through,  
For I had never,  I had never seen,  
Love bring the in ward strip me bare  

With flowers of white, with flowers of red;   
And then I sat down waiting  
To hear love come running  
And the voice quick assembling; 

But Love, the priest was lost,  
And all around in the Chapel, was Love in sight,  
The burning of desire,  
Joy as high as heaven's wall  

And I heard a wailing, like a nightingale  
In a darkened wood,  
\n
And I had to cry,  
Beneath,  
Till Love should return,  
And then fain would I sing again.

- William Blake
