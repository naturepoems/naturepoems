Nature

The happiest man is he who learns from nature
The lesson of worship.

To see the art of forms,
To read in the sky
The story told in leaves;
In the sun, the dancing multitude,
The evergreen music,
And the day's moving shape.

Send your eyes further down,
Let them find the deep
Where the lilies twist,
And behold the cosmos
Drawing lines of beauty,
A haunted field, a lovely glade.

All that is, the sun makes golden,
And each hour has a voice to speak,
Speaking of God, of grace, and of love,
Which are the best of nature's gifts.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
