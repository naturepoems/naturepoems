A Bird Came Down the Walk

A bird came down the walk:
he did not know I saw;
he bit an angleworm in halves
and ate the fellow, raw,
and then he drank a dew
from a convenient grass,

and then hopped sidewise to the wall
to let a beetle pass;
he glanced with rapid eyes
that hurried all around;
—they looked like frightened beads,
as if they sought for something, found,

I watched him for a minute
and then withdrew my head,
I guessing that he did not see me there,

and I concluded that he was not afraid.


- William Carlos Williams
