NATURE-SONG
Come, my beloved, wander with me
Through the lush fields and whispering woods.
The gentle curve of the land entwined,
Beckons with murmured undertones.

In the arms of hay, fresh and sweet,
Listen – the impulse of desire runs deep;
Nature draws forth, colors present,
Wildly documenting every sigh,
The way of stars and roots entwined.

- Carl Sandburg
