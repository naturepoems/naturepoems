Landscape with the Fall of Icarus
According to Brueghel
a few were saved.

The sun shone
and the world went on,

as ignorance is often
said to be bliss.

But the man or the farmer,
that went on the plowing,

and Icarus, he fell.

So little time,
as nothing occurred.
Why this world would have thought
that no one felt him},

- William Carlos Williams
