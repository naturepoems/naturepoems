Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction

I.
The poem of the mind in the act of finding
What will suffice. It has not always had
To find: the scene was set. It was the mind
That showed when we had found it, when we were

In the waking state, and heaved bewilderment,
In the air of summer, as we came to the sea,
With the dark trees in the sun, and the shore
That is never broken, completed by less humble walls,
The rafters, the wings of birds.

II.
I am matured toward the structure of the forms,
Presence and absence in the radiant air,
The sound that shook this moment, defining unreal.
And the moment was always defined as this.

Always we were there; we were ever endured,
Endured, wherever, near the sound. So we sang till
4. afternoon, with sound at the shore,
And first the beauty of the air.

III.
It was that beauty and brilliance of an air.
It is not simply the surfaces—from the surface's
Start to determine space—space determines
4. Only the enormity of the life in a face,
And the vast horizons unfold, like snakes along the shore.
