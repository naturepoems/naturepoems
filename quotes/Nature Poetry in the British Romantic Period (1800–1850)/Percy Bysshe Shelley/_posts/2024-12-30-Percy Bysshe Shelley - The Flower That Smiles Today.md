The Flower That Smiles Today

The flower that smiles today,
Tomorrow dies;
All things that are, arise
From earth and sink to earth, lying;
The heavenly sun, the breezes that
Play with the trees,
When spring brings back the flower,
Bring the hand that strews it away.
Though at midday the light is blazing,
And our shade hides deeply where the water
Rests in face of fear and fire,
The tender love can call again.
Hear, as the past is heart of the hour—
For each hour's life of flower.
We live, we die—oh time most sweet—
Find us our souls, free and moot.

— Percy Bysshe Shelley
