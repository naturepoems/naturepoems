The sun dips low on silent hills,
This day, at last, must fade,
Yet shadows stretch with lingering thrills,
As night begins to parade.

Each star, a distant lantern bright,
Guides thoughts through twilight's mist,
In the constellations’ gentle light,
Memories of daylight kissed.

Let quiet settle o’er the land,
Where day and night entwine,
Hold nature’s truth blessed and grand,
In the whispers of the divine.

- David Garnett
