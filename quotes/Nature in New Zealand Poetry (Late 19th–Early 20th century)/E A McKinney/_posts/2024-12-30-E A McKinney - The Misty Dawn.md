The Misty Dawn

Awake, dear world, to the misty embrace,
Where shadows dance coyly, a silvery lace,
In the dim light of morn, when the day is yet young,
Nature awakens, her ballad half sung.

Through the veil of the fog, shapes come to be,
The hills curve and roll like waves of the sea,
The whispering grasses, the breath of the chill,
All poetry crafted by nature's own will.

Such beauty lies hidden in dawn’s gentle grip,
In the embrace of the mist, let your worries slip,
For in every soft breath, with each fleeting glance,
Nature invites us to join in the dance.
