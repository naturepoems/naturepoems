The ocean’s breath, a gentle sigh,  
Caresses shores where seagulls fly,  
Each wave that kisses sandy land,  
A secret shared between sea and sand.

Moonlit nights, where shadows gleam,  
Reflecting dreams within the stream,  
Here lies the heart of earth's embrace,  
In every tide, a fleeting grace.
