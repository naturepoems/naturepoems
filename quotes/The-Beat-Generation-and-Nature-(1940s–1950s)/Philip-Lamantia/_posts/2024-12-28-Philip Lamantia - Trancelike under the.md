Trancelike, under the moonlight,
I saw the path of the night:
Leaves echo in their shadowed flight.
Whenever I would lie under the veil,
I would hear the whispers sail.

Starlit sky and dawn's embrace,
An infinite circle of grace.
The dance of the earth, in rhythm alive,
Trickles of time, where the spirits derive.
