Through tangled vines and blooming haze,
The garden calls in fragrant ways.
In petals bright, a tale unfolds,
Of gentle mysteries and secrets told.

Each bloom, a treasure to behold,
A story spun in threads of gold.
In natureâ€™s realm, where we are free,
Find solace there, just you and me.


- Henry James
