The Daffodils

There are moments when the leaves  
Are like soft whispers in the trees,  
While flowers burst with fragrant breath,  
Like angels dancing with the leaves.  

For during all the bright spring hour,  
The daffodils their heads display,  
In hoards of gold and fleeting power,  
Brightening scenes of fragile play.  

In every curve and every leaf,  
Is light and warmth evolving swift;  
To gentle hearts, their joys replete  
With laughter and the breath of gift.  

Oh nature’s bounty sweetly grows,  
Alive with praise for years to come;  
For in returned loving petals goes  
A tune that carries hearts back home.
