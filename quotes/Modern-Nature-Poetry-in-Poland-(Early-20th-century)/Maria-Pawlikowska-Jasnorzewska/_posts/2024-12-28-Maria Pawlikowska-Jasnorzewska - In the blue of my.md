In the blue of my dreams,
Where the paths of the wood bend,
I walk upon the whispers of leaves.
The sun slices my thoughts,
Melts the boundaries of distance.

Here, the wildflowers laugh,
And the reeds answer in whispers,
While the river pulls allâ€”
A solemn hymn to the sky.

The trees have secrets to tell
For those who pause, for those who listen
To the rustle of their silken dresses,
As the evening draws near.

- Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
