In whispers sweet the willows sway,  
Their long green fingers gently tease  
The passing breeze that comes to play,  
In light that dances through the leaves.  
  
The flowers nod their heads to greet  
The day that dawns in golden rays,  
And all the world seems true and sweet  
In nature’s grand and simple ways.  
  
So let us walk this lovely ground,  
With open hearts and minds in tune,  
For in this splendid place we’ve found  
The joy of life beneath the moon.

- Robert Frost
