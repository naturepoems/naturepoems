When autumn paints the leaves in gold,
And stories of the year unfold,
A tapestry of vibrant hues,
Nature’s canvas, rich and true.

The crisp air carries a whispered song,
As we wander, where we belong,
In the cycle of life, we find our place,
Embracing each season’s warm embrace.

- Lytton Strachey
