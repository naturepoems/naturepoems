The Mountain  
 
Majestic mountain, standing tall,  
Witness to the seasons’ call;  
With snow-capped peaks and mighty form,  
You make my spirit bright and warm.  

In your silence, wisdom reigns,  
Through the valleys, life sustains;  
Oh, show me how to rise above,  
And teach me strength with gentle love.

- William Henry Channing
