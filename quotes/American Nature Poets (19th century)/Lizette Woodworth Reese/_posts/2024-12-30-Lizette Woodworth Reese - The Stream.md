The Stream

I love the running water,
   That sings on its merry way;
And whispers to the flowers,
   The secrets of the day.

It bounces over the stones,
   And sparkles in the sun;
Like a child at play it frolics,
   Its youth can’t be outrun.

The willows dip their tresses
   To touch the water’s cheek,
While the dragonflies are dancing,
   And the sunbeams leap and sneak.

O little stream, my comrade,
   I’m grateful for your tune;
You bring me peace and gladness,
   Beneath the laughing moon.

- Lizette Woodworth Reese
