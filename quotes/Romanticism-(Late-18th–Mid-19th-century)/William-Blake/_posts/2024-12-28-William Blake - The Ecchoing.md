The Ecchoing Green

The sun does arise,
And make happy the skies;
The merry bells ring
To welcome the spring;

The sky-lark and thrush,
The bird of the bush,
Sing louder around
To the bells’ cheerful sound;

While our sports shall be seen
On the Ecchoing Green.

Old John with white hair
Does laugh away care,
Sitting under the oak
Among the old folk.

They laugh at our play,
And soon they all say:
"Such, such were the joys
When we all girls and boys,

In our prime youth’s season,
And found out our pleasing;
The sun does arise
And make happy the skies;

Those merry bells ring
To welcome the spring;
While our sports shall be seen
On the Ecchoing Green. 


- William Blake
