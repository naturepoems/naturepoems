Ode to the River!—in thy glory bright,  
Thou dost unfold thy silver path to me;  
In sunny hours, thy sparkling waves invite,  
And, in the storm, thy might sets me free.  

In tranquil moods, around thee I will lean,  
And on thy banks, breathe sweetly in the morn;  
Yet tides of joy, or sorrow, intervene—  
For every laugh, there’s one withered and worn.

- Charlotte Smith
