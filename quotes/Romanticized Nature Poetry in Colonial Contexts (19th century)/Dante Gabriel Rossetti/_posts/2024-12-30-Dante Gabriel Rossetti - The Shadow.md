The Shadow

I
  A lilac shade among the trees,
     A haunting space that holds the breeze;
     In whispered tones, the shadows fall,
     My spirit answers nature's call.

II
  As silver light through branches weaves,
     So tenderly, each heart believes,
     In every moment, sweet and rare,
     The shadows dance, the springs declare.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
