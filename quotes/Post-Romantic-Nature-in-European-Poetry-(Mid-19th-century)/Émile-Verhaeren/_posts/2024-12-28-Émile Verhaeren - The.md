The Autumn
The autumn breathes a slow decay,  
With a palette of burnt gold,  
As leaves relinquish their bright embrace,  
And the boughs their stories told.

A tapestry, once vivid bright,  
Now falls in silence slow,  
Cradling the earth in a warm farewell,  
As even the wind sings low.

- Émile Verhaeren
