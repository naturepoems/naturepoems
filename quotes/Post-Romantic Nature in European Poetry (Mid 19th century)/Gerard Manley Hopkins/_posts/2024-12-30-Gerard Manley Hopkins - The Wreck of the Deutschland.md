The Wreck of the Deutschland

In the dark night; night that henceforth lies,
  To smear into the seaâ€™s eternal thirst;
  By the crested commands of the sea, my done complete,
  The ship sailed over, carking in pride first.

The farthest march of fate, the berth drawn sun,
  Cities below; wellsoared light:
  What cannot change what becomes fair!
  One sea forms its arms, yet shares it in twilight.


- Gerard Manley Hopkins
