In woodland glades where shadows fall,  
The ferns and moss with stories call;  
They weave a tapestry of green,  
In nature’s arms, my soul is seen.  
I wander on with joyful heart,  
For in this world, I play my part;  
Each rustling branch, each whispered prayer,  
A bond I share with everywhere.

- Bessy H Elliott
