Summer
Trimmed as is summer  
The leaf's green hand,  
Upon its pulsing surround,  
Embraces dust and sand
 
The light stretches its wings  
And the birds depart,  
To new-found gorgeous haunt  
Where they renew their art.
 
Life blossoms all around  
What is just and fair,  
And love, fierce as the sun,  
Makes all the gardens bare.

- John Clare
