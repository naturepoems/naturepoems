Frosted Mornings

When the world wakes to silver, to frost’s gentle kiss,

And the breath of the dawn curls in vaporous flight,

I wander through dreams, in this tranquil abyss,

Where the sparkle of nature turns morning to light.

Each crystal a treasure, each moment divine,

In the grasp of the cold, beauty finds her way,

In the heart of the frost, all worries benign,

And the warmth of creation brings forth a new day.

- David Garnett
