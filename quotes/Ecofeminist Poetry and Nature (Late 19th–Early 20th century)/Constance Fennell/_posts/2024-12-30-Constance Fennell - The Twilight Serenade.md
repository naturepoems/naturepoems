The Twilight Serenade

The twilight folds the vale in silken night,
  As gentle shadows bathe the world in peace;
  The crickets chant their evening serenade,
  While softest breezes bring the day’s release.

A lone owl hoots from out the looming tree,
  A haunting note that echoes through the glade;
  The stars awaken slowly; one by one,
  Until the firmament is brightly laid.

I stand absorbed in all that Time has wrought,
  The golden daylight fades like melting glass,
  And at my feet fair Nature's charm is caught,
  She weaves a tapestry that none surpass.

So let the night enfold my heart in grace,
  And as the shadows stretch, my spirit take
  Its flight among the mystic moon’s embrace,
  To where the fields of starlit dreams awake.

- Constance Fennell
