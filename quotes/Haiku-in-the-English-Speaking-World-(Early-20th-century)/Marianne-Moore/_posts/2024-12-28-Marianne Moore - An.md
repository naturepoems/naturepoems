An Octopus
   In a lazy ocean,
   he calls upon the history
   of tides, feeding upon
   unguessed gristles, wise;
   patterned secrets caught
   in an elaborate dance,
   the seaweed swells—
   with shapes dependent upon
   the mercies of light,
   floating through
the rich caress of stars—

- Marianne Moore
