In these fields where flowers bloom,  
Where sweet fragrance doth consume;  
Let the heart no sorrow know,  
As the rivers gently flow.  
Here is peace that nature gives,  
In the quiet where a spirit lives.  

Every star—a wish of mine,  
Every leaf—your heart divine!  
May I find in every glance,  
The call of love—the sweetest chance.

- Sir Philip Sidney
