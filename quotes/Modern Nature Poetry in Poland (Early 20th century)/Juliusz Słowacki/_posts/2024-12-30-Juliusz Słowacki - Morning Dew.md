Glistening drops on emerald blades,
Morning dew on fragrant meads.
A symphony of colors spread,
Across the fields where the wildflower leads.

Under the vast and stretching sky,
With clouds that drift and play,
The sun begins its gentle rise,
Kissing the earth in golden rays.

Oh, the beauty that I behold,
In nature's lavish embrace,
Life unfolds a story told,
In every leaf and every space.


- Juliusz Słowacki
