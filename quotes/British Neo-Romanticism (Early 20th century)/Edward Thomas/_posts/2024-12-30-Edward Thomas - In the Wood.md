In the Wood

In the wood, the light is thin,
Shadowed by branches, green and thin,
Where gentle breezes weave and play,
And dance the colors of the day.

Sunlight dapples, quietly glows,
Upon the fern where stillness grows,
Beneath the canopy, wood and sky,
Lifted by whispers that softly sigh.

Through mossy beds, the wild things roam,
Ever entwined, as vines would comb,
A hidden world, alluring, deep,
In nature’s cradle, here I sleep.

The world unfurls, an endless thread,
And in that peace, I’m gently led,
To wander through this tranquil space,
Where heartbeats echo, there’s grace embraced.

- Edward Thomas
