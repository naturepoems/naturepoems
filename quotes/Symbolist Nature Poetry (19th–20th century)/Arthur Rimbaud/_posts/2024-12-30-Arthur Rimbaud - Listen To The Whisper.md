Listen to the whisper of the trees above,
A soft serenade of mystery and love.
The brook carries echoes of laughter and song,
Embracing the essence of where we belong.
Here, amongst dreams where the shadows may fall,
Amidst the scents of nature, we hear the call,
Beneath eternal skies, we shall ever tread,
In the realm of nature, where beauty is spread.

- Arthur Rimbaud
