Morning Dew

When the morning dew is glistening,
And dawn awakes with gentle rays,
Nature’s music sweetly whispering,
Begins the world anew each day.

With every drop, a diamond bright,
The grass adorns the earth with grace;
In this moment, pure delight,
I find my heart, a sacred place.

- Rosa Zagnoni Marinone
