The mountains rise like ancient giants,
Guardians of secrets, strong and wise;
Their peaks caress the azure heavens,
In the light that paints the morning skies.

Valleys cradle rivers flowing,
Singing songs of timeless grace;
Each bend reveals a hidden wonder,
In this sacred, hallowed space.

Let the wild embrace your heart,
In the stillness, find your way;
For in the embrace of nature's child,
Youâ€™ll feel at peace and whole today.

- Arthur Rimbaud
