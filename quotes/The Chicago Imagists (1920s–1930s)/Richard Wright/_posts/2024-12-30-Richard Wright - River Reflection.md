Here by the river's edge,
I watch as nature unfolds,
The water dances in the sunlight,
Creating ripples of laughter.

The wildflowers nod in the breeze,
Their colors bright against the green,
A celebration of life,
In every petal and stem.

I breathe in the freshness,
The scent of earth and bloom,
A testament to resilience,
The beauty that persists,
In a world of constant change.

- Richard Wright
