Since There’s No Help
Since there’s no help, come, let us kiss and part;
Nay, I have done, you get no more of me;
And I am glad, yea, glad I’m rid of thee.
For having thee, of thee I could not part.

But, I must go, and I will go; I must,
And if I go, let me; else I am undone.
I think it best, to fare as I have done;
Gone is my heart, so let it go, I trust.

You get no more of me, for I’m not thee;
Yea, I have done, I’ll bid you now adieu.
Yet o my heart, should I behold you more
Do not refuse, but I must let you go.

To sadness, sadness for my long-lost soul;
Yet you shall find another whom to call.
A bitter end to what we love so true,
So there, farewell, for I bid you a last call!


- Michael Drayton
