The river flowed past, a silver ribbon,
Wandering its way through fields and trees;
The water rippled, and the light glistened,
While in the distance floated a soft breeze.

Here lies the quiet of the world at dawn,
Where shadows dance beneath the waking sky;
And every rustling leaf and distant fawn
Speaks secrets of the life that passes by.


- W H Auden
