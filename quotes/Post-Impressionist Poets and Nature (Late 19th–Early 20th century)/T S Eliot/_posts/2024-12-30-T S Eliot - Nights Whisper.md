The whisper of the leaves in the evening glow,  
   Carries with it the stories we know.  
   The sigh of the earth, in the still of the night,  
   Awakens our souls with its soft, tender light.
   
   The fast-flowing river reflects stars from above,  
   A tranquil reminder of nature’s pure love.  
   In this tranquil moment, we find our own peace,  
   Bound with the rhythm of life’s sweet release.

- T S Eliot
