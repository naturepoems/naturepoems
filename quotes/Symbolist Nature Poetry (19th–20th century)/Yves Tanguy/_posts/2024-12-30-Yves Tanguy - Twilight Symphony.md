In twilight’s grasp, the sky ignites,  
Crimson hues bleed into blue,  
A canvas vast where day unites,  
Nature’s palette, bold and true.

Whispers of winds that gently plead,  
As stars awaken, one by one,  
In the soft embrace, the heart takes heed,  
To the symphony of the setting sun.


- Yves Tanguy
