This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison
Nearly of the same age as the poet, 1837

Well, they are gone, and here I must remain,
This lime-tree bower my prison! I have lost
   I have lost
   The spring, twilight, and the grassy places,
   Where I would wish to be.

     …
   …

But what series of nature?

All things to all men.





The Poem ends here

- Samuel Taylor Coleridge
