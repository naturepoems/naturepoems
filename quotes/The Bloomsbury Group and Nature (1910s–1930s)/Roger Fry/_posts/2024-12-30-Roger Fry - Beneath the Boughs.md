Beneath the boughs, in dappled shade,
 Where fleeting dreams and whispers fade,
 The wildflower's breath, the tree's embrace,
 In nature's heart, we find our place.

 The crimson sky at dusk's soft call,
 The joyous lark that dares to fall,
 With each sweet note, in twilight's grasp,
 The world’s true beauty we can clasp.


- Roger Fry
