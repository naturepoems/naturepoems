The ocean breathes in a rhythm true,  
With waves that sing to the waiting shore;  
In this vast expanse, I feel the blue,  
And my spirit dances, forevermore.  

The gulls wheel high in the sunlit sky,  
As the sands shift softly beneath my feet;  
With every tide, a world passing by,  
In nature's embrace, my heart finds its beat.

- Ruth Dallas
