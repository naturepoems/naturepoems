Spring

When spring unseals and  
Turns the heart's compass,  
Resonating hymns of light,  
The tiny buds awake,  
Intricate whispers bloom.

Life growing swell,  
Soft tendrils scent the air,  
And the new-born sun  
Wraps itself around  
An opening fern, unfolding.

Just as life begins again,  
With laughter echoing  
In the silver hush,  
Where every petal  
Sings its song upon the breeze.

â€” D.H. Lawrence

- DH Lawrence
