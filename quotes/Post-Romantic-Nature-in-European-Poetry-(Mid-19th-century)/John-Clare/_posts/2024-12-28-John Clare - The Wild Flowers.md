The Wild Flower’s Song

I am a wild flower, and grow so free,
By the forest's side, by the sunny lea;
With a bright blue sky and a soft warm sun,
I dance with joy till the day is done.

In open fields or in shadow’s nook,
By the babbling brook, or the shady crook;
I lift my head to the gentle breeze,
For my spirit sings with the songs of trees.

- John Clare
