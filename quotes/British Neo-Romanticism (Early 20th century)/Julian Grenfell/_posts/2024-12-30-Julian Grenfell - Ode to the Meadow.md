Ode to the Meadow
Emerald green in the morning sun,
Lies the meadow with whispers sweet,
Where the lark sings high and the rivers run,
And wildflowers bend with an eager greet.
Each blade of grass a story tells,
Of seasons past and dreams anew,
In this haven where my spirit dwells,
Natureâ€™s heart is always true.



- Julian Grenfell
