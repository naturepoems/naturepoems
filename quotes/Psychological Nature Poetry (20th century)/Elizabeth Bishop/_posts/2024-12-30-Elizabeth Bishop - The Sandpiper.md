The Sandpiper

The child is watching the sandpiper
as the little bird
hops along the edge of the tide,
surfing, as it were,
as its little feet make their way.
It leaps and flutters,
a little heart full of wings,
astounding the child,
for all its potential,
its quickness, its weightlessness
that settles into innocence
and acceptance of fate.
