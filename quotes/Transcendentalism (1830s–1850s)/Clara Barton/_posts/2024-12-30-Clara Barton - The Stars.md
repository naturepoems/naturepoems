The Stars

At night, the stars like diamonds blight,
A tapestry on heaven’s face;
Twinkling whispers from the height,
Each light a memory, a trace.

Their stories etched in cosmic fight,
From ages past, they shine so bright;
Guiding wanderers lost in plight,
With quiet calm, they hold the night.

- Clara Barton
