O the joy of the valleys, where the wildflowers bloom,
And the laughter of waters banish all gloom;
Where the skies stretch in splendor, and the horizons sweep,
To the arms of the mountains, that cradle our sleep.

Through the paths of the wild, where the spirits take flight,
And the whispers of nature weave the fabric of night;
We find that the heartbeat of earth is our song,
As we dance with her beauty, where the heartstrings belong.


- C J Dennis
