To The Mountains

Oh, mountains, grand and proud you stand,
Your peaks adorned with robes of snow,
Sentinels of time, you watch the land,
With wisdom in your silent flow.

Through storms and sun you hold your grace,
The rivers race your ancient stone,
While valleys wrapped in soft embrace,
Are comforted, they are not alone.


- A R D Fairburn
