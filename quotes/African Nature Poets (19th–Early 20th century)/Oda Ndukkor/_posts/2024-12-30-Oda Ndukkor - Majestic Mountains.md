Majestic Mountains
Stand tall, oh mountains, proud and true,
Veiled in mist, kissed by dew.
Guardians of time, ancient and wise,
Your peaks touch the boundless skies.

In your embrace, I find my peace,
As nature’s wonders never cease.
Flowing rivers, cascading streams,
Reflecting all my fleeting dreams.


- Oda Ndukkor
