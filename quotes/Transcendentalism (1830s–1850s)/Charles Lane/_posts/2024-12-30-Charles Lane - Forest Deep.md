Oh, to walk the forest deep,
Where secrets of the ancients sleep,
The trees they sigh, the maples wave,
In this green realm, the spirit’s brave.

With every step where shadows dance,
I lose myself in nature’s trance,
No city’s call, no clamor loud,
Just peace and beauty, soft and proud.

- Charles Lane
