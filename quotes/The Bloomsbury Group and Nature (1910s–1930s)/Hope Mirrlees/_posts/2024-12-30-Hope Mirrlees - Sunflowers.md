SUNFLOWERS

Golden heads that turn to the sun,
Basking in warmth, unfurling their grace,
In fields of laughter, where joy is spun,
Holding the sunlight in each joyful face.

They shimmer like flames, in the warm summer’s ride,
Dancing together on delicate stalks,
Creating a chorus, nature’s own pride,
Drawing the poets and wandering folks.

Each petal a burst of wild happiness glows,
Facing the day with a heart open wide,
With love for the light, and the wild winds that blow,
In this waltz with nature, in beauty we bide.
