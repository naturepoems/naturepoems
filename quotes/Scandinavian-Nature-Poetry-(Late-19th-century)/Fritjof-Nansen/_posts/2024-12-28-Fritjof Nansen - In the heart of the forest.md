In the heart of the forest,  
Where shadows play and secrets dwell,  
Life awakens in whispers,  
The rustle of leaves,  
The chirp of hidden birds,  
A symphony vibrant and wild.

Here the oaks stand tall,  
Guardians of the grove,  
Their branches woven in a canopy,  
Filtering sunlight that breaks,  
Casting a mosaic on the earth,  
A dance of light and shade.

Moss carpets the ground,  
Soft beneath my wandering feet,  
While the fragrance of pine  
Wraps around me like a cloak,  
And the pulse of the wild  
Beats in my heart,  
Drawing me deeper into  
The embrace of nature's soul.

- Fritjof Nansen
