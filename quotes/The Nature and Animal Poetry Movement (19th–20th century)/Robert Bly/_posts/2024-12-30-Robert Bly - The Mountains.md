The Mountains

The mountains rise in their majesty,
Frozen giants in the morning mist,
Crowned by the first blush of dawn,
They hold the secrets of the world.

With each rocky ridge,  
And every whispered breeze,  
I feel the ancient pulse,
As I wander through their shadow,
Listening for the echoes,  
Of stories carved in stone.


- Robert Bly
