A city echoes upon distant hills,
Where shadows play like restless souls,
In the palette of twilight’s haze,
The buildings stand like ancient trees.

Nature creeps within the stone hearts,
A vine wrapping itself around defeat,
O, how beautifully it works, 
The silent art of soft intrusion.

In every opening, a glimpse remains,
Of suns absent yet ever present,
A hidden garden breathing freedom,
Amid layers of humanity’s grind.

- Giorgio de Chirico
