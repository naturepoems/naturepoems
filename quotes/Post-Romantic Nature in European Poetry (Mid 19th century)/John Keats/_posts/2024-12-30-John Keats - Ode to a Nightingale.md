Ode to a Nightingale

My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
But being too happy in thine happiness—

Know that through thee I drink with the joy of youth,
While visions of the Past still flow ahead,

And the damp air brings forth that haunting sound
Of the loud wind in scriptures of a million leaves.

For you like a warm embrace return home to me:
I breathe you, that I may never forget my roots,
Your music flows in ice-water veins
And freezes my heart into softest resolve.

— Ode to a Nightingale

- John Keats
