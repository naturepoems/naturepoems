---

The world is full of love and joy,
Down to the depths of the grave and the sound stores—
Beneath the sky of late summer, ah!
If I could but cling to the ground once more!

The woods in their twilight, the close of the day,
Are at rest from the noise, the sorrow now flowed,
O Heaven, that gives on thy note serene—
For I have loved the lovely view alone.


- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
