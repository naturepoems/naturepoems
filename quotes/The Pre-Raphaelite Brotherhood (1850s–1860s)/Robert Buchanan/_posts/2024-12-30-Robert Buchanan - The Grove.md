The Grove

I.
Beneath the branches wide and green,
A hushed serenity is seen;
The shadows cool, the sunbeams soft,
Wrap all the world in love aloft.

II.
The fluttering boughs above me sway,
With whispers loud, they bid me stay;
To listen to the moments blend,
As echoes of the daylight send.

III.
So let me find the quiet seat,
Where lovers whisper; here, I meet
The wild embrace of nature free,
In softest shade—serenity.

- Robert Buchanan
