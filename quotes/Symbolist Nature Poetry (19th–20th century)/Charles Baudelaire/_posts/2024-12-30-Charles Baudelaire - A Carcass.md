A Carcass

Take this carcass, the lover responses,
Soon they will spout with their much better roses,
Now they will get young from my poor embrace,
All in the air these blood-suckers for me!

As she opens her flower, the magnificent bloom,
Her fragrant petals touched with perfume,
Rise to blend with the sweet scent of rot,
While their hearts to decay in the soil will be caught.

Upon this heart, a husk is scattered,
A new coupling will happen, of mates in scattered,
They forgot me as they trod through the gate,
Their legacy born here from love's desecrate.

Embrace the poet's ire, all's rather reactive,
From these scents, from such letters, should be attractive;
In each flower, breathe the last sigh through,
Live life as they fade or gloss over new.

- Charles Baudelaire
