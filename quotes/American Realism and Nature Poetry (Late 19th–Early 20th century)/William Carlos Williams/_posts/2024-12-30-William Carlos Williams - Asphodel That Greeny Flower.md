Asphodel, That Greeny Flower

Asphodel
  that greeny flower

Like a lily of the valley

in the dark.

It will stand

there, beside, its people.

If I see them,

I shall not fear you,

but reach without,

as the sunlight
does from right to left.

To see: in time,
for we can plant
the blossoms deafened

to sights from far away.

- William Carlos Williams
