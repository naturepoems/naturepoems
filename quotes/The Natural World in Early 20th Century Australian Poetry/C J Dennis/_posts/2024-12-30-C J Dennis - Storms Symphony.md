When the thunder of storms draws the heavens a-drear,
And the raindrops come marching with a drumroll of cheer;
Then the earth drinks her fullness, and the colors unfold,
In the depths of confusion, the beautyâ€™s retold.

The rivers are laughing in their magical dance,
While the flowers break free from their slumbering trance;
For the cycle of seasons is a story of grace,
Where the heart of the wilderness finds its own place.


- C J Dennis
