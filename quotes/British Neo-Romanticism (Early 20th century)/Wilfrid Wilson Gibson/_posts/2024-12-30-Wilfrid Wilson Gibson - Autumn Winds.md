Autumn Winds

As yellow leaves in the breezes whirl,
Through twilight shades where the shadows play;
They dance with joy in a soothing swirl,
As autumn sings to close the day.

The whispering winds on hills unfold,
With tales of harvest, ripe and grand;
While farmyards clutter with grains of gold,
In fields where love and labor stand.

O sweet autumn, with your breath so soft,
You linger low in the duskâ€™s embrace;
And in your arms, we rise aloft,
With dreams that twinkle in your grace.

- Wilfrid Wilson Gibson
