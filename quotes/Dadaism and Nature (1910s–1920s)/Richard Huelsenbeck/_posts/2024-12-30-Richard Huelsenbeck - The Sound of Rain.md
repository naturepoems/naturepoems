The Sound of Rain

Listen closely to the rain,
Its rhythm is a call,
A drumming from the heavens,
As droplets begin to fall.
Each splash a sonnet spoken,
Against rooftops and on leaves,
Nature's heart comes alive,
The world heaves and breathes.

Streets shimmer with reflections,
Mirrors of the sky,
In the pour of the moment,
All around, life passes by.
Let the rainfall embrace you,
Let every splash declare,
That nature sings unbroken—
A song beyond compare.


- Richard Huelsenbeck
