Through groves of green and fields of gold,
The stories of nature lovingly unfold;
Where every blade of grass, every petal and stone,
Is woven with magic, a world of its own.

In the hush of the twilight, in the dawn's rosy blush,
Nature sings softly, a tender, sweet hush.
With the pulse of the earth beating firm in my chest,
In the dance of existence, my soul finds its rest.

- David Jones
