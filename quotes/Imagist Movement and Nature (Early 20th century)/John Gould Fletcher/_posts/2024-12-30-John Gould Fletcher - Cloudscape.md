Cloudscape
Floating high above the world,
The clouds gather like thoughts,
Each formation a story, a dream,
In the vast expanse of blue,
They drift and change, fluid and free,
A tapestry of shifting shapes,
Reflecting the heart of the earth,
In the ever-changing sky,
Natureâ€™s art laid bare,
A celestial dance of the wind.


- John Gould Fletcher
