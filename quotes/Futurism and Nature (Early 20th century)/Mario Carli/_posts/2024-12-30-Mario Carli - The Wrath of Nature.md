The Wrath of Nature
The thunder rolls,
Rumbling like the fury of a thousand horses
Stampeding through the valleys,
While the sky darkens,
And lightning strikes in wild abandon,
Nature's wrath unleashed,
A tempest of power,
In sweeping squalls,
A chaos of wind and rain,
Yet amidst this storm,
A green world awakens,
Life bursting forth anew,
As the clouds clear
And the sun once more returns
To warm the earth.


- Mario Carli
