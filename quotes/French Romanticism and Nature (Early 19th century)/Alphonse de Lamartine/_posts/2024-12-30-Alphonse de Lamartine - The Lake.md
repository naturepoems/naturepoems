The Lake

Calm and serene this lake, so bright and pure,
Its crystal surface reflects the radiant sky;
The gentle breeze, a whisper, cool and demure,
While soft the lapping waves weave by and by.

In twilightâ€™s blush, the world seems to pause,
As nature draws her breath, in peace profound;
The mountains guard it close, their rugged laws,
Encircling the good, the sweet, the sound.

O Time! O Nature! cease this endless fight,
In this haven I find solace and delight.

- Alphonse de Lamartine
