A Song of Wind

The wind is a traveler, wild and free,
   It carries the song of the earth,
It brushes the leaves on the old, tall trees,
   Calling them forth to their mirth.

O spirit of nature, sweet and bold,
   Dance through me as I roam;
For in every gust, I feel your hold,
   And know in my heart I am home.

- Marjorie Pickthall
