In every season bright, I stand, 
To find the face of thee, O love heather!
For nature in her gentle hand,
Weaves love's bouquet, abide together!

So blend your path beneath my shade,
For in the end, let rapture find,
The flowers that fragrance every glade,
Will forever bond our hearts entwined!

- Robert Herrick
