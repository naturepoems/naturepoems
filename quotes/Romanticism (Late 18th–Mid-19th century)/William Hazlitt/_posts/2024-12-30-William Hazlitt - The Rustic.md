The Rustic

A mighty tumult sweeps along the Plain,  
The ground shakes at the Angel's call;  
The little brook sings merrily on her way,  
So sweetly— do you hear her?  
Like a maid!  

Wandereth beneath the dew  
Around the trees, all whispering near;  
The house, with its pathway ribb’d about,  
Where youth do play and prance with mirthful cheer.  

Yet full of song and further light!  
And purpose, hidden from the Heart —  
Where still a thousand cycles meet,  
Produce varietal art.  

How oft I've walked, in solitude,  
And heard them sing of that delight!  
To thee, in every simple guise,  
Of all—so pure and bright.

- William Hazlitt
