Mountain Echoes

High above in sapphire blue,
Where silence reigns, the eagles flew,
The mountains rise, a steadfast crew,
In timeless grace, their majesty true.

With every stone, a tale unfurls,
Of ancient winds and raging swirls,
They echo back our whispered dreams,
In rugged peaks, the soul redeems.
