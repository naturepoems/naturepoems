This is the forest primeval.  
The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,  
Bearded with moss, and in garments green,
In silence they nod as they sway.

But in the midst of their stillness lies,  
A whisper woven in each call,
A promise of dreams yet to rise—  
Life will always answer, in nature’s thrall.


- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
