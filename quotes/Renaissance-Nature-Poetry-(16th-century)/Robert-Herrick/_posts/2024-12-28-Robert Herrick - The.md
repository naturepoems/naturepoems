The Maypole

Gather ye roses while ye may,
Old Time is still a-flying;
And this same flower that smiles today
Is destined to be dying.

For we must dance around the Maypole,
With flowers and songs of merriment;
Let's rejoice, celebrate, and let the spring
Be our festivity's only rent!

So hold my hand, and let us spin,
As nature breathes and smiles within.
For as the seasons come and go,
We find our secrets â€” let them flow.

- Robert Herrick
