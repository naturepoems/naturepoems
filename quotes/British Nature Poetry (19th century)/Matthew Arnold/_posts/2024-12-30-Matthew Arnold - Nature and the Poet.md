To nature no less than to art,
Made for our healing, we submit;
The freshening air, the cool earth's part,
Give us that peace which we can fit.

The stars look down on us, they shine,
The sun is ours, and moonlit nights,
The woods and meads are ever fine,
And nature speaks in tones, delights.


- Matthew Arnold
