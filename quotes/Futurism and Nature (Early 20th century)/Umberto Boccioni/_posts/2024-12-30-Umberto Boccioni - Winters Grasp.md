Winter’s Grasp

A blanket of white,
quietly covers the earth,
as breath fogs the air,
a gentle sigh of slumber.

The trees stand stark,
silhouetted against a frail sky,
as shadowed limbs stretch
while snowflakes fall in peace.

Each flake a whisper,
a delicate touch,
as they weave a tapestry
of fantasy and stillness.

We are drawn close,
as warmth flickers,
a fire’s embrace,
dancing shadows upon the walls.

Here in calm,
we find solace,
a moment suspended in time,
where winter cradles all
in its frozen arms.

--- Umberto Boccioni
