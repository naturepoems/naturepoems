Sunset's Embrace
As the sun dips low, the sky ignites,
With fiery hues that banish nights.
A canvas brushed by nature’s hand,
In awe, I stand on this blessed land.

The world slows down, a peaceful sigh,
As day gives way to the starry sky.
With every sunset, dreams take flight,
In the tender embrace of fading light.
