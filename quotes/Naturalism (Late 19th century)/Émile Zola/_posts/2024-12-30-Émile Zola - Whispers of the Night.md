Leaves rustle in whispers, in the hush of the night,  
where the fireflies twinkle, in a dance of delight.  
Beneath the great canopy, stars flicker above,  
it’s a realm that sings softly, of peace and of love.

From the roots that are buried to the branches that gleam,  
every creature is woven in nature’s sweet dream.  
In this tapestry rich, where the harmony swells,  
i find my reflection in the stories it tells.

- Émile Zola
