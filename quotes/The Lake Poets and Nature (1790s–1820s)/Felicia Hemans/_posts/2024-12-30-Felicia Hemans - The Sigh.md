The Sigh

There’s a sigh in the forest, a sigh in the air,
A murmur of voices that whisper in prayer;
The tall ancient trees tilt their heads to the night,
And the moon breathes a wish in the silver light.

The flowers lean close to each other in trust,
As the dusk dresses each leaf in its diamond dust;
While the brook sings its song in the coolness of eve,
Woven deep with the heart, oh! if we believe!

There’s a sigh in the forest, a sigh in the air,
And our hearts with that whisper shall always fare;
For Nature’s embrace will hold us in peace,
And in every sigh, our sorrows shall cease.

—Felicia Hemans
