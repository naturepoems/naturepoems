Morning Dew

With morning dew, the meadow glows,
Each blade a jewel, fresh and bright,
Where nature’s beauty gently flows,
And each new day awakens light.

The world is clean, the air is sweet,
A fragrant breath, a whispered prayer,
In silence, nature’s heart will beat,
A sacred space we all can share.


- A R D Fairburn
