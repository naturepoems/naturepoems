The Sunlit Glade

In the glade where sunshine falls,
And shadows intertwine and play,
I hear the distant woodland calls,
And time itself doth gently sway.

The butterflies, they dance so light,
In colors vivid, bright, and fair;
While every note of bird in flight,
Is woven deeper in my hair.

This moment holds the world alive,
Where beauty reigns and spirits soar;
In nature's arms my heart shall thrive,
And in her presence, I want no more.

- Thomas Woolner
