O once I wondered how the woods could sing—
While happy breezes sough'd through all their leaves—
Until I felt the beauty passed within.
My heart breaking with pleasure, that my dreams,
Once known but lost, could breathe the day away.

The woods I passed, 
Eloquent to a man: the trees in prayer—
The sky, once silent, now awash with light—
Around me only thoughts of beauty spoke,
And softly did I melt with the sweet wind, 
Dancing under branches queathed in spring.
