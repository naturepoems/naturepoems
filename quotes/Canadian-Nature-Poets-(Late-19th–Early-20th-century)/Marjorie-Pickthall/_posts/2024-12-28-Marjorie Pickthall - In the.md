In the Garden

The flowers are like little children,
   They laugh and dance in the light;
They nod their heads to the breezes,
   And twinkle stars in the night.

The lilies are proud and gracious,
   The daisies humble and sweet;
In the garden’s gentle embrace,
   My heart finds its tender beat.

- Marjorie Pickthall
