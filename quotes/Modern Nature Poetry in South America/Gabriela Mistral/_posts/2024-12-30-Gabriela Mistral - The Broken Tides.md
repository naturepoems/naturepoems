The Broken Tides

I walked on shores unstilled  
as creatures slept around me.  
Clear glances led me on  
to whisper broken tides;  
yonder seas got tossed  
in moments of content and song.  

For every breath I let out,  
a leaf in the grove discloses  
some dusk derived in  
seas of azure converse.  
The air runs thick  
with possibilities left,  
that softly caress the breast  
of the world.

For there is a chance to feel  
the turning of spring over waves  
where nature keeps pursuing  
to play about  
a siesta of bright fables.

- Gabriela Mistral
