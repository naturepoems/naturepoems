There is a place
Where the green grass grows,
Above the city,
The white house,
With a red door.

The trees are full of
Birds filled with song,
Where the light will shine
Over all for hours,
So all things may be new.

A place of peace,
The killer clouds are far away,
And the softness of the wind
Brings the flowers close to me.

- Carl Sandburg
