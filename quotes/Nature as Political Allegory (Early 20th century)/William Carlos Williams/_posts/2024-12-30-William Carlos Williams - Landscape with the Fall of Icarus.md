Landscape with the Fall of Icarus
According to Brueghel
when Icarus fell
it was spring

    a farmer was ploughing
    his field
    the whole pageantry
    of the world
    was awash
    in green.

        Nobody
        noticed!
    When Icarus fell,
    it was spring.


- William Carlos Williams
