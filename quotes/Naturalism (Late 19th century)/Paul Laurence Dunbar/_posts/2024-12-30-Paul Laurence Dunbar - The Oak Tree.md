The mighty oak stands firm and free,  
A monument of majesty.  
Its branches spread, its leaves do sway,  
In harmony with winds at play.  

The roots delve deep in ancient earth,  
A steadfast witness of life's worth.  
In quiet strength, it finds its fate,  
A symbol true, both wise and great.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
