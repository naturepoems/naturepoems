Oh, gentle breeze that stirs the leaves,
And sways the boughs in gentle tune,
You carry whispers from the eaves,
To greet the flowers, kiss the moon.

Your caress sings through the meadowâ€™s grace,
A symphony of earth and sky;
With every breath, you keep the pace,
As day and night, together lie.


- F W Harvey
