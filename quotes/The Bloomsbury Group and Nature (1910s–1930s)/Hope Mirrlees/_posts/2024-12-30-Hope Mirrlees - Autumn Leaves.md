AUTUMN LEAVES

The leaves whisper secrets as they fall down,
Soft spirals of gold, and russet, and brown.
In flickering flames they tremble and sway,
Like memories gathered, old hopes on display.

Rustling the earth, like the song of a breeze,
They dance with the spindrift of summer’s unease,
Writing the stories of light through the haze,
Farewell to the summer, in autumn’s rich blaze.

A last bright bow, as the chill comes to stay,
They flutter like relatives in fading array,
While candles of twilight wash skies with their glow,
They scatter like laughter; the end of a show.
