Nature, the only true  
Scapegoat for mankind  
In all her quiet ways,  
She weaves the leaves that bind —  

In shadows deep, she looks  
On every tear and sigh –  
Which rise like morning fog  
To wrap the night sky high –  

From every tree and flower,  
A gift of silence flows —  
And yet, it is the heart  
Which feels what Nature knows –

- Emily Dickinson
