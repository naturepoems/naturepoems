The Brook

I.
O babbling brook, thou flowest strong,
In laughter and in song;
Thou teachest all thy waters bright,
To dance and sing alike at night.

II.
Thy murmurs soft like love’s refrain,
Bring peace to all the  weary pain;
And through the depths of tranquil dreams,
Thou castest forth the sun’s sweet beams.

III.
Let me dwell, O gentle stream,
In thy soft embrace—a blessed dream;
For many woes dost thou dispel,
With brook and birds—ah, all is well!

- Robert Buchanan
