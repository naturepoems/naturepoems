Song of the Acacia

In the glow of the golden dawn,
The acacia blooms with pride,
Its branches stretch wide and strong,
Embracing the vastness beside.

Pollinators come to dance,
In a fragrant, fleeting trance,
Life teems beneath the sun,
Rejoicing in its chance.

Oh, sweet acacia, steadfast,
Guarding the secrets you keep,
You hold the stories of the land,
In your roots, deep and steep.

- Ossie Mthembu
