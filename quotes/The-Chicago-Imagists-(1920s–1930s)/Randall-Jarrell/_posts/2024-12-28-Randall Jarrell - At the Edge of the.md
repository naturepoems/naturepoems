At the Edge of the Sea
    Look, no clouds. Water lies still,
    Waves keep kissing the sand.
    Clarity and focus are at war
    With incantations sung long past.

    Bright stars walk on endless ripples,
    Cool breezes sink, all whispers drown.
    The ocean’s pulse beats beneath my feet,
    As I cease to search and learn.

- Randall Jarrell
