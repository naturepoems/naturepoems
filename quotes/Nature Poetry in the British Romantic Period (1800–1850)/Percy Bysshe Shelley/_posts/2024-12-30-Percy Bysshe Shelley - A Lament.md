A Lament

The sighing chorus of heaven and earth,
So true to the dim pale night-instrument,—
What shall remain of that pale broken heart? 
When will it capture that peace, or repose—
For life was the dream of an eye, dark and golden; 
Love will liberate, and be thankful, for they
Keep it in the floating stream and glee of the moment!  

— Percy Bysshe Shelley
