The Rose of the World
The rose of the world is a beautiful flower,
That at eve on the knees of the daylight
Tilts and bends, sharing the view
Of winds that blow with the last of the light.

You see the sun and night,
As one slender sweep of magic light,
For while love is young, the woman is here;
All the wild hills keep out of sight.

Till our veiling thoughts shall star above,
On the breathing winds that sway
In the dreams of lovers near and afar;
But still, the rose will bite the day.

- William Butler Yeats
