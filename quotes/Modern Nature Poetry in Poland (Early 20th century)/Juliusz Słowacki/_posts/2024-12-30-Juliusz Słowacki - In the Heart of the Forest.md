In the heart of the forest deep,
Where secrets linger and shadows creep,
I wander through the ancient trees,
Swaying gently in the evening breeze.

The brook sings softly, a lullaby,
To weary travelers passing by.
A world untouched, so pure, divine,
In every corner, nature's design.

Oh, take me back to the wild unknown,
In the peace of the woods, I have grown.
For in this place, I find my soul,
As the earth and sky together console.


- Juliusz Słowacki
