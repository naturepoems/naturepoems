The Snow Storm

The snow, like a curtain,
  falls over everything,
  the great gray curtain;
it separates the world
  from itself â€”
it dulls all sounds,
  arranges trees undemanding
of the eyes.

Life is shrouded,
  but all truth rises 
bubbling away,
  slipping around the bushes,
  the creeks still open,
while the snow shrinks,
  nearly disappears,
  stunning the life
back into its shapes,
into the heart of creation.

- A R Ammons
