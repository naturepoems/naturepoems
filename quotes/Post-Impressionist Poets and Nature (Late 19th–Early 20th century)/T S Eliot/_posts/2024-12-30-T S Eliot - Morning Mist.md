Amidst the mist, the mountains arise,  
   Touching the heavens, like fingers that sigh.  
   The dawn breaks softly, a whisper of gold,  
   As breathless beauty begins to unfold.
   
   Trails lead through forests, where memories gleam,  
   Laced in the light of a lingering dream.  
   Nature embraces, with arms open wide,  
   Inviting hearts in, with love as the guide.

- T S Eliot
