To the First Snowfall

First Snowfall, on your knee
Tells that Winter hushes pain.
Under fold of white, we see
Days must rest now; life is lain.

Flake o’er flake, new joy assigned
Turns warm homes to silent halls,
Frost on eaves and rooms confined
To gentle peace and snowball thralls.

But softly—it’s you I adore,
Cloth that shrouds each careless deed;
Beyond the frozen gall we bore,
The beauty bound to you, dear seed

Fandango over fields anew,
Your mirth beholds Warren of Speech;
So send the art through skies, where dew
Of colored blinks still breach

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
