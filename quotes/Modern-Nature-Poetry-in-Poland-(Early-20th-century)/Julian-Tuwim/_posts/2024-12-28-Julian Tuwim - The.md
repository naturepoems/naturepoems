The Grass
I see, from dawn till dusk,
the grass grows, whispers,
its green between the stones,
its lucid, gentle aromas,
its little flowers sparkling
like water in the heat.

I feel it softly brush
against my legs, like a handâ€”
what a strange caress it is,
its tenderness afield.
Each blade like a secret
waiting to be released.


- Julian Tuwim
