The flowers whisper in the breeze,
   A thousand secrets they impart,
In every petalâ€™s soft release
   Is spun a tune that warms the heart.

The sprawling grasses sway and dance,
   While honey bees buzz in delight,
Upon this vale my eyes entrance,
   The world is pure, and love is bright.

- John Clare
