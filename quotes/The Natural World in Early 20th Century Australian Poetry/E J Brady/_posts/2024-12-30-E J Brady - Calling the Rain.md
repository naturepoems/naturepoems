Calling the Rain

Oh, gather around, you clouds so grey,  
For our land is thirsty, and begs that you stay;  
Let the droplets fall like silver beads,  
To quench the earth, to nourish her needs.  

The parched ground is cracking, begging for life,  
As the sun burns down, and the days are rife;  
With whispers of hope carried on the breeze,  
We call for the rain, oh hear us with ease!  

And when the thunder rumbles fierce above,  
In your cascade, we hear the earth’s love;  
So dance with us here, both wild and free,  
For in your embrace, there’s unity.

- E J Brady
