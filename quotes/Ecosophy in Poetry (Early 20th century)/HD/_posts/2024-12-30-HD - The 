The Flower

Flower upon flower,
Spring unfolds her yarn, 
A tapestry woven,
Bright colors in a palm.

Petals brush through air, 
Invoke the softest prayer,
An offering of spirit,
In fragrance, freely there.

From soil to canopy, 
The fairest of blooms, 
Sing forth a melody 
Held pure in the earthâ€™s womb.
