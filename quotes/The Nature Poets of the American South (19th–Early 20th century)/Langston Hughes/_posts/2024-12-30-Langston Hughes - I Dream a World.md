I Dream a World
I dream a world where man
No other man will scorn,
Where love will bless the earth
And peace its paths adorn.

I dream a world where all
Will know sweet freedom’s way,
Where cruel cars of greed
Shall not impede the day.

A world I dream where black
And white, all, will share
A world that has accepted
All hearts as fair.



- Langston Hughes
