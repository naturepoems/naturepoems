The summer sun does gently shine,
On fields of gold and ivy fine,
With every ray that bathes the earth,
There lies the promise of boundless worth.

In the cool shade of the grove,
Where lovers sigh and secrets strove,
Nature cradles hearts so free,
In her embrace, we find the key.

- Lytton Strachey
