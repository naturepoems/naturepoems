The Call of the Wild
In the forest deep, where shadows play,
The wild calls with a voice profound,
Through thickets dense and oaks' array,
In solitude, true peace is found.

Echoes of life sway in the breeze,
A chorus of whispers, a melodic sound,
In natureâ€™s arms, the spirit frees,
In the heart of the wild, we are bound.

- Aasta Holth
