The moon hangs like a lantern in the deep,
a guardian in the velvet night sky.

Stars twinkle like promise and dreams,
a silent congregation in their watchful gaze.

In the embrace of night, peace spills forth,
cradling the weary with its gentle touch.

Here, under the cosmos, we find our place,
a tapestry of being woven with the heavens.

- Kate Bush
