---

A voice from the woods doth call me,
   To the shadowy glen's retreat;
Where the gnarled oak stands ballied,
   And the brook sings low, and sweet.

O! what whispers of the past,
   The leaves in the breezes sway,
They weave the tales long cast,
   Of those who wandered away.

- Matthew Arnold
