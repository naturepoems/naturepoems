The Trail
We walk the sunken trail,
Winding through the shaded green,
Where the whispering leaves,
Tell secrets of the past,
And the path is soft beneath our feet,
A carpet woven from natureâ€™s loom.
The beauty here is fragile,
Yet it holds such strength,
Binding us to each moment,
The world in perfect harmony.


- John Gould Fletcher
