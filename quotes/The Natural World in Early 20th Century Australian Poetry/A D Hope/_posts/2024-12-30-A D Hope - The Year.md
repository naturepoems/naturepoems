The Year
The year unfolds like petals greet,  
The kiss of summer turns to fall,  
In tender moments, life’s retreat,  
Echoes of nature’s haunting call.

Through seasons, earth begins to weave,  
With strokes of brush, both dark and bright,  
In every change, we dare believe,  
That time flows on, a deep delight.

Remembered echoes paint the sky,  
In every hue, the heart must bend;  
As countless wonders will pass by,  
In nature's arms, to be our friend.
