This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison

Well, they are gone, and here I must remain,
This lime-tree bower my prison! I have lost
Beautiful thoughts and radiant visions. I
Am not that I was before! O what a heart
Must feel it! But I am left to weep,
And think of happier times.

Ah! that I might alone
In solitude here wander, with the gentle breeze
Wakened by soft winds that crop
The verdure and the leaves of this towered tree!

Yet I must feel it—that I am not forgotten;
And what a satisfaction! And could that,\n
Leave me poor? I cannot sing they're gone,
And yet I sing—as something slumbering.'

2.   The Rime of the Ancient Mariner

It is an ancient Mariner,
And he stoppeth one of three.
'By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,
Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?'

The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:
He cannot choose but go;
And thus spake on that ancient man,
The bright-eyed Mariner.

'It is a far-away time for me:
And it is great a tale to tell;
To hear ye, gentle friend, inquire
What wondrous thing befell.

3.   Frost at Midnight

The frost performs its secret ministry,
Unhelped by any wind. The owlet's cry
Came loud—and hark, again!
I listened, till I heard it again.

The gray-haired man, beside me sleeping,
Is a soul of quiet good. But when I think
Of the great Mystery—that could make
This man so passive,

I hardly dare to think of the whole—the whole
Of Creation in itself—
Unless with solemn glee, \n
Thou shouldst lend thy light!

4.   Kubla Khan

In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure-dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea.

So twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round:
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
And here were forests ancient as the hills,
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.

5.   The Nightingale

My soul is a shadow of thy melodies,
And with the gentlest phrases of consent
Thou smil'st into my heart of weariness;
Singing to those unlearned temples in the grove;
Bidding the nightingale answer thy sweet song with her lyre.

O bird, with such wild-grace,
From the bough to the bough you fly,
With pure exhilaration! Through the trees abound
In branches arching overhead,
O source of beauty! Speak to the night,

Bidding her dusk to be.

6.   The Eolian Harp

My pensive Sitar! thou that canst thus sing
Of sorrow, joy, and mingling notes that fly
From the soft strains of the wind! O thou dost wing
My thoughts away upon the breezy sigh!

Beneath this canopy of green
Oh, what a rapture-wed they could glean,
If I were but the harper, high!

 +

7.   The Brook

I come from haunts of coot and hern;
I make a sudden sally
And sparkle out among the fern,
To bicker down a valley;

By sixty soldiers, they can go,
I am the Brook that runs within.
I am the king of the Hill!
Alive am I! my thoughts live on every day.

 +

8.   The Pains of Sleep

O! the joy of the flowered stock,
Under which I lay in fervent glee,
That should utter but one cry,
And I would wake again and be set free.

The meadow, silent, in my dreams,
Turns to glory in blue tranquillity.
Cease not, O New Earth! 

 +

9.   To Nature

O human Spirit! needing many a poison, desire
To make thee omnipresent to all that breathe.
Yet dost thou fill with thoughts divine,
Both the great spirit and the flowers that breathe.

O dewy love! O holy light!
It is there that Nature's die,
In every shade of colour sweet!

 +

10.   To a Gentleman

O Nature, I have heard thy sounds!
How they rise from every little ground;
Over solemn woods, o'er calmes in hills!  

Each pulse that beats to thy gentle sway!
Thine is the hand that fills my heart,
And whilst thou givest, I lay in sweet eternities.

   

- Samuel Taylor Coleridge
