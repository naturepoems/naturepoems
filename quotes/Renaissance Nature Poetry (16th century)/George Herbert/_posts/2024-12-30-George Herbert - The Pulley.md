The Pulley

When God at first made man, 
Having a glass of blessings standing by;  
Let us, said he,  
Fullness of joy,  
Would be his happiness. 
Let us pick out the best  
Or have a taste of  that cup; 
Endow him, said he,  
With traits that will lift and win,  
That he not live all single. 
He will wear the crown all day,  
And find his rest in things of  love, joy, and peace.  
But with all this,  
He will not trust me;  
For I have denied him sleep.  
For in the world to come,  
He will find himself cast in exile  
To find the glass that ever staysâ€”  
The Power to which man moves.



- George Herbert
