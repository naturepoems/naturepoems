When Death Comes

When death comes
like the hungry bear in autumn;
when death comes
and takes all the light from
my life, I want to step
into my own life.

It is not my wish to hide away,
believing that others have,
or will, come in my place.

Instead, I want to step
into my own alive skin
and feel the earth beneath me,

the dry earth dust of summer
beneath my open hands,

and in me a great wildness,
every flower in the field,

and every color swaying
as in a great dance.
