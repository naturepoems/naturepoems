A still – Volcano – Life –  
That has the essence of a certain Clime –  
That turns into a universe  
Of Nature's own sublime –  

And Heaven seems more Secure,  
Unyielding, Impassive when  
The Sacred Comes upon its tides,  
To wash – and ease – again –  

All souls may gather with the Stars  
Watch them storm the worlds of Fire  
For none can curb the measure sweet  
Of all we dare to lose –

- Emily Dickinson
