The clouds drift by, a soft parade,  
A canvas where the sun has played.  
In shades of gray and blissful white,  
They change and shift to artful sight.  

And when the storm does rumble loud,  
The fury passes, nature bowed.  
Yet in its wake, the glories gleam,  
With every storm, a fresh new dream.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
