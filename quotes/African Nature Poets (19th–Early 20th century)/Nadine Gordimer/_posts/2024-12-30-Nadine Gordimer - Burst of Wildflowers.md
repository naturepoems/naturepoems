The wildflowers burst,
like laughter in a quiet room,
their brightness too much,
teaching us to take chances—
a mosaic of colors,
blue, red, yellow circling in bliss,
underneath the guile of green.

If only the heart could match
nature’s exuberance,
we’d be bold,
swaying not afraid,
every word dropping like petals,
every thought blossoming,
every mess a moment of joy.

- Nadine Gordimer
