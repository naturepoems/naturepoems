O, spring of wings, where'er you roam,
In the wild shadows of earth and sky,
Your laughter echoes soft like light,
In the whispering of days gone by.

The waves do dance, the flowers spring
Forever to the joy of things—Please stay—
The light of distant skies will sing
Through hearts, remembering yesterday.


- Lord Alfred Tennyson
