When the Sun Goes Down

When the sun goes down and the light is bare,
    And the shadows creep on with a sigh,
There will be a voice in the dark somewhere
    That will call me low, in a voice that is shy.

I have often rejoiced, in the sheen of the skies,
    With the thrill of the leaves, as they drifted down;
But in silence and dream of the night, there lies
    The song that is caught in the silence's crown.

And I watch in the star-led glimmer, afire,
    While the breeze thrills out from the leaves above,
Till the night falls soft with the shining desire,
    That will call on the dream of a yearning love.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
