The End of Autumn

Leaves, like memories, drift away,
In the cool sighs of the fading day;
Among the branches, movements wane,
As nature sighs, a tender refrain.

Once vibrant colors now wear down,
A tapestry of golds and browns;
The crisp air beckons as life prepares,
For winter’s hush, the earth's sweet cares.

Yet within this fading, there lies grace,
In letting go, each holds a space;
Autumn whispers through the barren trees,
A farewell kiss, a gentle breeze.

So gather close, the warmth we find,
Through seasons’ cycles, intertwined,
For in the end, there’s beauty true,
In the shared stories of me and you.

- Albert Samain
