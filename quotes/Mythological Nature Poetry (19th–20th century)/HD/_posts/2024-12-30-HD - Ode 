O fair city,
O sweet birthright
beneath the hand
of the rain,
I have wandered
you in the twilight
from dusk to dawn.

Trees, young trees,
carefree at your gates,
climbing conversationally
their way
above the old
stone walls,
as if you were 
a part of the
world; as if the
rosebushes’ petals
could be heard in your
softness.

Who were you,
a memory, shining
from the pools,
a reflection of the
gold from yesterday?

When the dawn breaks
all is lost, yet still
I hear the river’s
laughter below.
Is it the same water?
Is this the same song, or anew?
