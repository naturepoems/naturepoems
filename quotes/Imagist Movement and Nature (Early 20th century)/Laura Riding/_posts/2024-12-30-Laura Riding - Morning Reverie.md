In the quiet embrace of dawn, 
Nature kneels at my feet, 
With subtle notes of fragrance,  
Awake from all slumbering rest,
Feel the prickling edges of dew,
Whisper softly into dry air, 
And lift my spirit as it rises—
Sprouted in cheer; 
For the fog rolls softly away,
Lightly suspended in moments of bliss,  
Where reality gives itself over—
To become the symphony of low birdsong, 
In sweet formation winding as I stand, 
Breathless under the wonder of daylight.
