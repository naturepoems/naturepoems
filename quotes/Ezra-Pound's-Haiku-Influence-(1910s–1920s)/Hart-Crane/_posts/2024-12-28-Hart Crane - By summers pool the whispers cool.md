Where willow's dip breaks the lapping sound— 
A secret state wreathed in natural rule,  
To still the heart, and clasp the ground."

By summer’s pool the whispers cool, 
Where willow's dip breaks the lapping sound— 
A secret state wreathed in natural rule,  
To still the heart, and clasp the ground.
