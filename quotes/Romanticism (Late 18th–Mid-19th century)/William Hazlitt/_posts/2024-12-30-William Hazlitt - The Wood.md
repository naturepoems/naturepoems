The Wood  

O searches of the haunted woods,  
Where every sound doth lead,  
From trickling brooks to fruiting buds,  
To gently sing — in peace!  

Where every shade doth stay to dream,  
With rippling streams and light;  
The lilies from the banks do gleam,  
With gold and azure bright!  

The skies shall hold you, here to trace,  
The tears of morning dew;  
In every wood a prayer to grace,  
The blessed earth anew!

- William Hazlitt
