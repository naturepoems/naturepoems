The call of the wild, a heart's refrain,  
In the rustling leaves and gentle rain,  
Where nature's spirit roams so free,  
Here lies the essence of you and me.

Underneath a sky painted in dreams,  
We find ourselves in nature’s streams,  
With each heartbeat, the truth we glean,  
In the wild, we live, we love, we glean.

- Thomas Mofolo
