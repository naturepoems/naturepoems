Each grain of mud, the uprooting of weeds,
The temperature of the air, the color of the sky,
All conspire in a tiny patch of earth,
To breathe life in the stillness of the morning."

The Elements
Each grain of mud, the uprooting of weeds,
The temperature of the air, the color of the sky,
All conspire in a tiny patch of earth,
To breathe life in the stillness of the morning.

- Francis Ponge
