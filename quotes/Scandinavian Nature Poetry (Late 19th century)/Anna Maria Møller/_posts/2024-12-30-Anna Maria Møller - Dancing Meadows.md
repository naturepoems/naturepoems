Dancing Meadows

In fields of gold where wildflowers sway,
The gentle breeze begins to play,
With every petal, every seed,
The dance of nature, pure and freed.

A tapestry of color bright,
Under the sun, a pure delight,
Butterflies flit from bloom to bloom,
In this paradise, all worries loom.

Life's simple joys in every glance,
In the meadows, we find our chance,
To lose ourselves, to breathe, to be,
In nature's arms, we find the key.


- Anna Maria Møller
