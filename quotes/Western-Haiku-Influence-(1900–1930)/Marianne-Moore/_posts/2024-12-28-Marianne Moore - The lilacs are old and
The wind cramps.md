quote: "The lilacs are old, and
The wind cramps their sound.
That swarm, sullen and sweet,
Is the scent, unadorned,
Of reminiscence, recalling
Days when the air was kind."

The lilacs are old, and
The wind cramps their sound.
That swarm, sullen and sweet,
Is the scent, unadorned,
Of reminiscence, recalling
Days when the air was kind.
