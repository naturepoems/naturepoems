For it was now evening, and the roads turned to mist,
  The trees flamed like bursts of color,
  And as I walked by the river,
  The water glimmered in the fading light.
  I stood beneath the arching trees,
  Listening to the whispers of the leaves,
  Calling to the open sky,
  Where colors blended as day slipped into night.
  The world softened, becoming a dream,  
  And I was filled with a lightness,
  As if weightless with the joys of the woods.

  - from "Evening Glow" (1916)
