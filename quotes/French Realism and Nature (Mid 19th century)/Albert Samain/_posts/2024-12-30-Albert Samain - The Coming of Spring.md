The Coming of Spring

Through winter’s grasp, the buds appear,
Soft words emerge from silenced earth,
Colors break forth, from darkened fear,
A symphony heralds spring’s rebirth.

The crocus lifts its dainty head,
Dancing in the softening light,
While daffodils in gold are spread,
A wild celebration of day’s delight.

Bees begin their bustling spree,
Amidst the blooms that paint the fields,
Life hums in joyous harmony,
Each petal, a promise nature yields.

For every breath speaks of renewal,
The air imbued with hope’s embrace,
Spring’s tender gifts, gentle, spectral,
In every corner of time and space.

- Albert Samain
