The Flowering of the Rod

The reeds are growing wild  
in the corner  
of the still water,  
they have tipped themselves in bloom  
with leaves uncurled by the weight 
of the waters, 
by light that speaks a language  
yet unwritten  
in the footprints of youth,  
in the bruised shapes of love.

They grew close, thus,  
daring  
to dare, knowing not  
the darkness of the ocean,  
the unknown light in the depths.
Their roots were deep,  
their blooms were bright,  
yet here they caught themselves.  

Bend beside this water,  
this cool tide,  
this forgotten, sacred site  
dedicated to presences  
of flowers. 
Produce the poison wood  
that guards this flowered head.  
For life falters.

Continue the malady of light,  
of water that shines out empty,  
vanishing our markings  
yet born by the sun's edge.
