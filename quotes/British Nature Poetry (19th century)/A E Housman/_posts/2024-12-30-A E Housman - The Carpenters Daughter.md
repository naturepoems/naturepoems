The carpenter's daughter is in the sun,
Pray you, that when the evening comes,
Upon her five steps and the lurking glum,
She knows not I stood with my heart undone;  

O catch me! Sun-dried, last-breathing air.
And bless next year where evenly runs
The surface of our thoughts in open grounds,
Full with elusive patterns in the air!

- A E Housman
