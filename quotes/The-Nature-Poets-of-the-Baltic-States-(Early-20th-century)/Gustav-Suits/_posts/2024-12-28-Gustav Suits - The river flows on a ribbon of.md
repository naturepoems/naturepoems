The river flows on, a ribbon of dreams,
a mirror reflecting the sun’s golden beams.
It dances through valleys, in silvered gleams,
singing old stories to the wind’s gentle themes.

Willows weep softly, their branches a curtain,
while nature, unhurried, keeps drawing the curtain.
Each ripple, each rustle, a note in a song,
reminds us that nature always belongs.


- Gustav Suits
