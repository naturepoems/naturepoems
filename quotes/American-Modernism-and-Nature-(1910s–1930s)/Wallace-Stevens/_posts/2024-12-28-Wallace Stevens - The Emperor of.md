The Emperor of Ice-Cream
Let be be finale of seem.
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.

Let us solemnize the coffins of the dead,
Let us make them worthy of remembrance.
Because our mortality, one cannot avoid
In truth, though, the heat remains for the trees.

So, let them permeate the startling morning,
Let them share in the earthly bounty.
Where the ice-cream on the table waits,
It is a world that thinks beyond,
And above the beauteous soil.

- Wallace Stevens
