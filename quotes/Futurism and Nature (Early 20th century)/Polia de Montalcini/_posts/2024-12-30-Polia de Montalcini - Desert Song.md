Desert Song

Barren beauty stretches,
a harsh and stark terrain,
a palette of ochers and reds,
silhouettes of life’s persistence,
a delicate dance beneath the sun.

Cacti stand as sentinels,
a fortress against desolation,
while under the surface,
the heartbeat of resilience echoes,
waiting for the rains to come.

At twilight, it transforms,
the air thick with promise,
twinkles of stars awakening,
a serenade to the lonely,
where even drought understands
that life flourishes—in shadows and light.
