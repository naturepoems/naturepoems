Dawn Chorus

                   The dawn comes dancing through the trees,
                   With birdsong lifting, sweet and clear,
                   A symphony on morning's breeze,
                   As nature wakes, and starts to steer.
                   
                   Each chirp and tweet in perfect time,
                   Lifts from the branches, soft and light,
                   Inviting every heart to rhyme,
                   In blissful tune with dayâ€™s first sight.
                   
                   O sing to me, you feathered throng,
                   Let every note weave in my veins,
                   For life returns, and humbly strong,
                   My soul your song forever claims.

- Ivor Gurney
