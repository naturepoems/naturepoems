author: Futurist Poet
quote: "The sky is a fabric, unfurled blue,
Threaded with dreams, drifting through
Clouds that dance like wild thoughts,
In a world where logic is caught, and tossed.

Silence unravels on a sunlit stream,
Nature hymns in a whispered dream.
A branch breaks free, a bird takes flight,
In joyous rebellion against the night."

The sky is a fabric, unfurled blue,
Threaded with dreams, drifting through
Clouds that dance like wild thoughts,
In a world where logic is caught, and tossed.

Silence unravels on a sunlit stream,
Nature hymns in a whispered dream.
A branch breaks free, a bird takes flight,
In joyous rebellion against the night.
