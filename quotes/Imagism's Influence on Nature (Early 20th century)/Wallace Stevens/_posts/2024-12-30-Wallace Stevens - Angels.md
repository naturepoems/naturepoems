Angels

In a world of red dust and blue caves
Emerging from the pine trees, among the stars,
The angels spread their wings,
And fly where the gray rain falls  
And rings like the empty sky.

The angels soared and left
Some semblance of music;  
But it blurred on the horizon
As silence, only their wings.


- Wallace Stevens
