The trees with the lilies, 
   And the sun dial has fun,
The meadow everywhere shares;
   Here I find one glimmering, golden way.

   Touch a few threads, broken hope,
Roll on gently as the grass appears,
   Softly murmuring a Listening mind,
So that the winds will gather flowers.
— *To the Grass*

- John Keats
