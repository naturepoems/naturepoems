The Mountain's Echo
High on the peak, the air is pure,
Where silence reigns and hearts are sure,
Each step an echo, firm and clear,
In nature’s embrace, we draw near.

The valleys call, the rivers cascade,
In majesty, the world displayed,
In awe we stand, with breathing sighs,
In mountains high, our spirit flies.

- Mieczysław Wojnicz
