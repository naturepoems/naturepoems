To Build a Fire

He was alone in the wilderness, the cold the only companion he could hope to know, instincts of the land thrumming through his veins,
the bitter, biting cold making him question the very presence of life, longing for the comfort of home.
In nature's fierce grasp, he felt as if he was merely a transient body, fighting against the intertwining laws of survival and nature.

- Jack London
