Gifts of Rain

    The rain is the sound of life falling.
    It pours down like grief, soaking through,
    Each drop a pulse of longing,
    Bathing the roots of the earth.

    My heart reaches out, cased in heavy warmth;
    Water floods through veins,
    A pulse, a fruit of lusty emergence,
    Renewal runs across every creature’s skin.

    But here in stillness I wait,
    Watching the inky scars of leaves curled tight,
    Waiting for the transmutation, the trembling,
    As silence breathes this hunger into awakening.

    


- Ted Hughes
