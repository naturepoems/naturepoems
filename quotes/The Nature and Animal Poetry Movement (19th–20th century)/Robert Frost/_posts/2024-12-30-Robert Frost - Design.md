Design
I found a dimpled spider, fat and white,
On a white heal-all, holding up a moth
Like a white piece of rigid satin cloth——
Ah, what a power of sight  for the fit to have! 

If design governs in a world, the white,
How tangled and all hung up in its flight,
The features of the design shine white——
Something that looks beautiful at the right,
And finer in darkness yet fit to die.

The little moth, the spider with its might,
Will cease too much more than fitted, even at night,
And something whole might give us a warning without fail.
Even white-winged sprouts make their way to find a trail.

- Robert Frost
