The Habitats

The lucid shore is not the sun;  
The journey loudest sighs and leads,  
As slug with fire, burns with grace;  
Life shares where virtue breathes,  
Twice a day as thou should know.
  
For all must have a validated mark  
Where roots grip down and thus ariseâ€”  
The boughs loved here it is ours,  
Against the night-cover, I seek life for mine eyes.

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
