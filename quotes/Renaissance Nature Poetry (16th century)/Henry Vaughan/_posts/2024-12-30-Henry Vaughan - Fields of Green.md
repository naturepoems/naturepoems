As I wander through fields of green,  
The vastness of the bloom astounds;  
In natureâ€™s heart, life springs unseen,  
Through every rise, every soft mound.

The sun and rain, they kiss the earth,  
Connecting souls with nature's plan;  
In every life, in every birth,  
The circle winds, an endless span.
