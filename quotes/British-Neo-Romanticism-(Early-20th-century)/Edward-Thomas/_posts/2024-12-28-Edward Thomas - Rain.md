Rain

The rain has fallen all the night,
And the world is wet in its delight.
As rivers swell with gathering strength,
The time has come for stories' length.

With every drop a tale unfolds,
A dance of whispers among the folds,
For nature weaves a silken thread,
Where dreaming hearts are gently led.

So let the rain inspire our dreams,
And cleanse our thoughts with gentle streams,
For through the clouds, the skies are blue,
And life begins anew in dew.

- Edward Thomas
