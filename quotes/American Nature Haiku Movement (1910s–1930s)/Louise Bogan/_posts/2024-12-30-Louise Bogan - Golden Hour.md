The sun spills gold,
Through the boughs of ancient trees—
Their arms stretched wide, 
Holding days long and warm,
While shadows play at their feet,
And bliss becomes the air.

Wildflowers bloom,
Their scents entangled,
In a dance of colors,
And the breeze hums softly,
A song for the heart's embrace.
