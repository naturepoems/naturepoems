THE WILDERNESS

In wilderness, where silence reigns,
And trees seem standing still,
The whisper of the winds they bring,
Attract the heart’s sweet thrill.

Oh mark the wild notes, songbirds lift,
Among the stretching trees,
They echo through the glens and hills,
In nature’s symphonies.

It is here each heart finds solace,
In every rustle, sigh, or chant,
Where peace and wild freedom blend,
In every blooming plant.


- Lydia Maria Child
