quote: "The rhythm of rain taps on rooftops high,
Little dancers falling from the sky.
Each droplet a note in the symphony's score,
Nature composes forevermore.

Chaos finds form as puddles reflect,
A world upside down, a perfect defect.
Dada dreams in the splash of a shoe,
Where art and madness finally break through."

The rhythm of rain taps on rooftops high,
Little dancers falling from the sky.
Each droplet a note in the symphony's score,
Nature composes forevermore.

Chaos finds form as puddles reflect,
A world upside down, a perfect defect.
Dada dreams in the splash of a shoe,
Where art and madness finally break through.
