The Plumet Basilisk

Even when still and not moving is an unexpected twist
an unexpectedly deliberate lizard,
i know who will care to look, disappearing,
invisible under blooms and bits of leaf:
it seems strange to me that nature allows
such wildness and calmness in one sweep,
yet I direct my gaze toward the track
of each foot. The wonder is where—so many
are so silvered with earth.
Singed by their existence, or made eloquent,
just a sense of feel, in answer,
yet, its readiness allows
striking colors and camouflage
but fleeting, remain sheen among the seen;
beauty holds us sporadically—
always more than mud, even when unthrown.

- Marianne Moore
