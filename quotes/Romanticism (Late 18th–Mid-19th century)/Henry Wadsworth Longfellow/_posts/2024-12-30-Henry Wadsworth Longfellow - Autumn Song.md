Autumn Song

O hushed the woods, the stillness wears  
A silent strain the breezes share;  
The golden mist, like fingers fair,  
Waves softly through the autumn fairs. 

From my heart, in whispers low,  
I raise a prayer to thee, serene,  
The autumn beauty, now foreseen,  
And chase the winter’s chilling glow.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
