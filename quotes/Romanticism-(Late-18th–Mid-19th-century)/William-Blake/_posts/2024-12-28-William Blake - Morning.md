Morning

O thou who passest thro’ our vallies in
Thy Chariot of the Sun,
Crown’d with the harvest of the golden grain,

I would gather a garland of flowers for thee,
And go up to thee, a sweet offering,
For the beauty of the earth, and the glory of the skies,

And the mystic voices of the woods,
And the homely whispering of the streams,

Which speak of thee to my heart.

- William Blake
