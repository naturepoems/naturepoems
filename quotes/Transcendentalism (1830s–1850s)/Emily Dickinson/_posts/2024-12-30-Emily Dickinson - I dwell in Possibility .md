I dwell in Possibility –  
A fairer House than Prose –  
More numerous of Windows –  
Superior – for Doors –  

The Spread of Town – could not confine  
The mind – to a niche –  
In the rear of the Gown –  
Sits the Muse – on a Pompous Stave –  

My neighbors – do not sing  
Nor gallivant along the Way –  
What then shall I invent  
To play along – for Open Air  

Like Russet Leaves –  
Beneath a dark Rain –  
There – built of sunlight,  
They wear a Brighter Grain –

- Emily Dickinson
