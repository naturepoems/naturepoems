The mountains lift their heads on high,
   Wrapped in the mist, so sweet and pale;
They guard our dreams, they heed our sighs,
   They hold our secrets in their veil.

Oh, Nature! let me dwell with thee,
   In quietude and sacred trust;
For all thy wonders I can see,
   Are blessings precious, wise, and just.

- Adelaide Anne Procter
