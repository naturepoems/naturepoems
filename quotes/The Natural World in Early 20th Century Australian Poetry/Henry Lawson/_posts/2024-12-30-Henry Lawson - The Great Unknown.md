The Great Unknown

In the silence of the night,
Where the starry realms unfold,
Nature shows her endless light,
In the whispers fresh and bold.

Mountains rise in dreams unknown,
Colors paint the tales of yore,
Where the heart finds beauty grown,
Beneath the skies forevermore.

Let me wander, lost in thought,
Through the vistas wide and bright,
Every moment captured, caught,
In the magic of the night.

- Henry Lawson
