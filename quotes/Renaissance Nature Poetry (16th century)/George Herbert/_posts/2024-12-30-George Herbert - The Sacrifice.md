The Sacrifice

Thou seest thy creature,  
Wringing trees scatter the earth,  
While the parched bodies draw nearest dusk.  
But hear our words, O Lord, for our veil is rent  
In mercy as in light,  
That we should be lifted there to raise  
Our gratitudes in every part of this place,  
And imbue gardens by the service.



- George Herbert
