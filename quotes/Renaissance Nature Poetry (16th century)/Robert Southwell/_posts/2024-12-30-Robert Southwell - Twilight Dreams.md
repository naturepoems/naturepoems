When twilight drapes the hills in dreams,
And silver moonlight softly gleams,
The world beneath is hushed and still,
As nature breathes a tranquil will.
In shadows deep, the night awakes,
And through the dark, the river snakes;
A symphony of hush and sigh,
In natureâ€™s arms, we learn to fly.

- Robert Southwell
