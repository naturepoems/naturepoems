Autumn’s Call
When leaves turn gold and branches bare,
The crisp air whispers secrets rare.
A tapestry of warmth and grace,
In autumn’s arms, we find our place.

Harbingers of the coming chill,
Nature's palette, a vibrant thrill,
With every leaf that gently falls,
The beauty speaks, its silence calls.


- Antonio SantElia
