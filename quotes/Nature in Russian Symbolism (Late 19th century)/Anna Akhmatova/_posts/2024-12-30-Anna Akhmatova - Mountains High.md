To the mountains high, with their majestic grace,
I turn my heart in quiet reverie,
Their strength calls to the weary soul within,
In their towering shadows, I yearn to be free.

The air is crisp, filled with whispers of old,
As the path weaves winding through branches and stone,
Each step I take, a journey renewed,
In the grandeur of nature, I am not alone.


- Anna Akhmatova
