In the Valley of the Shadow

I. I hear the lark at break of day,
   The smallest bird that sings,
   And still the winter skies are gray,
   And still the freezing clings.

II. Yet day will break, and spring will come,
   And life will bloom anew;
   The air will hum with sweet perfume,
   And all will be fresh and true.


- Arthur Hugh Clough
