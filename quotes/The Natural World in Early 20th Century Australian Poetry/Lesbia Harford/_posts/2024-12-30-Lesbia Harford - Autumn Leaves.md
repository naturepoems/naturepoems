Autumn Leaves

Fallen leaves, in their quiet ground  
Are like dreams of a sun-washed town;  
Yet my heart paints still gold upon flesh,  
In flame with any falling leaves!  
Hereupon, through the rain or the sun,  
Let the chorus swell within  
In their slumberous feelings;  
For what fill your eyes are the eyes of time,  
And drifting here the mysteries find!

- Lesbia Harford
