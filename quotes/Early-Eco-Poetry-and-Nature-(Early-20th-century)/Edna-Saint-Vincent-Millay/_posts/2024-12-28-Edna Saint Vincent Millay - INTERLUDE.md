INTERLUDE

Amidst the windswept haze of summer,
The tendrils weave their whispered song,
Through boughs and limbs they deftly murmur,
And break into the dusk so strong.

I wander close, I still my heart,
To listen close to what winds convey,
In wilderness, unique to art,
Let natureâ€™s breath hold me at bay.


- Edna Saint Vincent Millay
