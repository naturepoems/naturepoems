Wild roses in the garden grow,
Much like the love that we now know;
These petals soft and scents intend,
Could bring a heart to ever bend.

When seasons wane and flowers fall,
Do not despair, love hears your call;
For nature speaks in vibrant hues,
And love will blossom, just as dues.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
