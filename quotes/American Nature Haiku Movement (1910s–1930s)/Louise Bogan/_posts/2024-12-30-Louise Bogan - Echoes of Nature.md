The mountain echoes back,
As rivers weave their tales,
Through valleys warm and wide.
Listen closely—
Nature speaks in whispers,
And every sound is a story.

The cliffs rise with defiance,
Against the fading of the day,
And the eagles soar—
Carrying with them,
The breath of the wild.


- Louise Bogan
