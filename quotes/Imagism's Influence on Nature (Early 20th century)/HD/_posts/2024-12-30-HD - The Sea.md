The Sea

O lady of the waters,

In the lean, green hills 

there crested the waves.

With your dark frost Kashmir,

planetary tides

still beneath your countenance,

therein is the sun,

and a whisper wakes.

Come, lady, the race

or the coins remain,

below the frailties

with whose colors.

We plunge the earth out,

with hem-falls and combs

and red explodes in the waves,

mingled and brought.

Yet wake thee to the waters;

you should sweep 

from the chords to space

a globe of crystal

in unison with stars.
