A Summer Day

There’s a silence, a golden glow,
Upon the vast and open field,
Where daisies dance and rivers flow,
And to nature’s wonders I yield.

The sun sets on our childhood dreams,
Each star a witness of our glee,
With every sigh the twilight beams,
And whispers soft beside the tree.

In the heart of wildness I’ll stay,
Just me and the summer’s delight—
With every heartbeat nature plays,
A symphony of day and night.

- John Muir
