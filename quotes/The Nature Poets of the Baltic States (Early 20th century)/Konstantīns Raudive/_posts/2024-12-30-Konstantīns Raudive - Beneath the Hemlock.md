Beneath the Hemlock

Deep in the hemlock shade,
Where the coolness lingers,
I find solace from the sun’s embrace,
Cradled in green respite,
Whispering secrets untold.

Moss carpets the earth,
A velvety throne,
Inviting weary travelers,
To pause in quiet reverie,
To listen to the heartbeat of time.

The breeze carries tales,
Of ages long past,
As I lay with closed eyes,
Breathing the whispers of nature,
Lost in the tapestry of the woods.

- Konstantīns Raudive
