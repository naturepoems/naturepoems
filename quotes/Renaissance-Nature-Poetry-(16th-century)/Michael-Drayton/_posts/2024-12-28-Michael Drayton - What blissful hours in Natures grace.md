What blissful hours in Nature’s grace  
We find within her green embrace!  
With every tree and every flower,  
A monument to life’s sweet power;  

From flowing rills to cascading streams,  
Each sight—a canvas for our dreams;  
To wander here, my soul must soar;  
For all of this, I crave for more.

- Michael Drayton
