THE GOOD MORROW

I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I
Did, till we lov'd? Were we not wean'd till then?
But suck'd on country pleasures, childishly?
Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers' den?

'Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be.
If ever any beauty I did see,
Which I desired, and got, 'twas but a dream of thee.

And now good morrow to our waking souls,
Which watch nor sleep, nor peace, nor show us what
We are; nor can we rest direct way; for round
We are in love, where we neither sleep nor know
What end our love would be, what sum to mention woo'd.

If we say we love, we know that very name
Will conjure better days, else be bested to die.
But love is so nobly crafted, never cease to hold
When, met, we find; so I wish we honour both,
Who bow before our grace of might, â€”thus cast our eyes.

- John Donne
