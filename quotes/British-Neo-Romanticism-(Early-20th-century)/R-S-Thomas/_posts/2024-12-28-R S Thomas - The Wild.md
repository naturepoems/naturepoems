The Wild Flowers

     Hear how the wild flowers,  
     tangle in their own laughter,  
often unseen...
     larkspur,  
blooming bell-clear  
in the wisdom of rain,  
a richness found,  
not bought.  

Straying beauty  
must suffer,  
bound, like sunlight,  
in the folds of a heart,  
its vigil shining bright,  
      in their negligence,  
the pulse,  
     a bosom of verse.

- R S Thomas
