The Fish

Wade through mud,
who, as I do, has a title
and ripens out the connections
between stimuli,
it is good to see it,

see it twist from a bow,
it is multiplied 3-D
and has a slippery IQ
of intelligence in the sink
of presenting itself.

In its state of being,
this tremblingâ€”
its only strength is what can be extruded,
eaten by birds,
or dried like sea palisade; 
pass on outfitting skies subsisting.
Napping in the sun,
it smooths the sun,
this statue in the water
is tied down as coral ghosts' wail.


- Marianne Moore
