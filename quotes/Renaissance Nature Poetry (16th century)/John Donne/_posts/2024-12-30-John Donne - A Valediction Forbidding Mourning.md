A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning

As virtuous men pass mildly away,
And whisper to their souls to go,
While some of their sad friends do say,
The breath goes now, and some say, No:
So let us melt, and make no noise,
No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move,
'Twere profanation of our joys
To tell the laity our love.

Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears;
Men reckon what it did and meant;
But trepidation of the spheres,
Though greater far, is innocent.
Dulcet, soft solitudes, acquired
Of pure and deepest dives of art;
But O, dear love, though it fall apart,
We have so great a Nature spired!

Our two souls therefore, which are one,
Though I must go, endure not yet
A breach, but an expansion,
Like gold to airy thinness beat.
If they be two, they are two so
As stiff twin compasses are two;
Thy soul, the fixt foot makes no show
To move, but doth, if the other do.

And though it in another sphere
Each hath a part, yet we see
How there be neither more nor severe
To part our nature; we are one, made free.
So let us not disturb the air,
But by our drowsy breath repay
The silent intercourse of natureâ€”all in a sway!

- John Donne
