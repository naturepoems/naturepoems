Hawk in the Rain

I
In the wind, the hawk
Follows, naked, through
The glistering holes of the storm,
In the howl of the woods,
As it swells soul and blood,
Floating nearer to god,
Unconscious, free.

II
Screaming, a rip in the dark,
A wisp, a hand thrust
Vain, out into sky-ribbed
Desolationâ€”then strikes 
The limp-winged moment,
The most heatless part,
Plumb through the chilling
Heart of the expanse,
Go to bed.

III
From soil through air, I
Want more than flesh;
I want this ruin.
The bag of bones stirs,
Daring menace with wing.
To raw drop. 
My faith is dying.
More fear than death now.

Hawk of the inconclusive
Simplicity, above the high ridge.
While in the blizzard,
Iptipity, soar to the heights
You have lost beyond the mist.
Immortal, I feel you. 
Danger, dread, dear desert; I

- Ted Hughes
