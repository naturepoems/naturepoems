I found a flower,
a single daisy in the field,
growing stubbornly in the soil,
its petals soft like the touch
of a mother’s hand.

It caught the sun’s rays,
a tiny sun in itself,
spreading joy,
as it swayed gently
in the wild breeze,
a delicate balance,
a testimony to life.

Nature paints in broad strokes,
yellow and white,
a masterpiece of simple beauty,
teaching us to find joy
in small things,
in each petal, each leaf,
ineach moment of being.

- Alice Walker
