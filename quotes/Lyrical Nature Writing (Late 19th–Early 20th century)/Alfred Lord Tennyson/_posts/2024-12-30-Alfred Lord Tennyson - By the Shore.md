By the shore of a silent sea,
  Where the winds are whispers low;
I made a wish on the stars set free,
  For the night to ever glow.

O, that kindness finds its way,
  That the heavens gently keep;
The soft embrace of the sandy bay,
  Wrapped in the robes of sleep.

And when the morning light breaks through,
  Casting gold upon the blue,
May I walk beside the shore anew,
  My dear with me, and you.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
