Perinde Ac Cadaver

Behold the world around and see,  
The heart of nature throbs alive;  
Each blade of grass, each whispering tree,  
Calls unto bright and pure to strive.  

Be still, ye hearts, and listen well,  
Each pulse obeying raw delight,  
Who mumbles through the twinkling spell—  
The breath of earth commands the night.  

Within serene horizons drown,  
Where sky and earth in rapture blend;  
Awake, beyond the colored town,  
There is a peace where voices end.
