The Garden  

By day the butterflies  
     emerge from the blooms  
     pulse slowly an  
architecture of colors  
     in shades of dusk.  

The flowers hold each  
     moment true,  
         even the soft branching  
of the mossy scents,  
     nectar sweetens this life,  
     we admire,  
invoking the heat.  

A garden blooms in  
      the heart,  
filling our desires  
     with hope in the air.  

Nature persists, an eternal hosting.  

Title: "The Garden"
