A Morning Walk

Upon the dew-kissed meadows,
With the freshening of the morn;
I walk among the wildflowers,
And let my spirit be reborn.

As the sun breaks through the shadows,
To enrich the world anew;
In the symphony of natureâ€™s song,
I find the strength to move on through.

So take a moment in this beauty,
Let your worries drift away;
For in the simple pleasures,
We embrace the gift of day.

- John Betjeman
