Beauty crowds me till I die,  
Beauty, mercy hath on me -  
Whose embrace grace - made provision  
Of rarest watchfulness in Light!  

While sunlight lingers near the Sea -  
Betwixt the Moon and the sun -  
As changeless as the Minds of Men  
In the starry heights above,  

Where Truth has its quality  
To blossom in the rime -  
Each leaf upon the ground sent word  
Upon my heart, to bloom divinely deep.

- Emily Dickinson
