The Star  
   
O lonely star in velvet skies,  
Your gentle light, a beacon true,  
With dreams of high and whispered sighs,  
In twilight’s hush, I gaze at you.  
  
You speak of worlds where wonder flows,  
In silent night, your wisdom glows,  
A guide to hearts with troubles deep,  
In cosmic dance, our souls you keep.  
  
O star that shines in darkest hour,  
A compass rare, so far apart,  
In earthbound trials, we draw our power,  
As nature’s voice, you stir the heart.

- Herman Melville
