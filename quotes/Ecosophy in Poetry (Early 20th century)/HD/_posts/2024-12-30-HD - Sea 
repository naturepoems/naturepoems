Sea Rose

O Rose, you are shed in the salt, 
Inclement and torn by the wind, 
You are not conventional; 
Your pleasure is not mild. 

You bloom from the depths of storm, 
You grow amidst the pain of the land, 
Shattered petals like stars through the murk, 
You wear the wild in the world.

Is this love? 
Is this beauty?
You hold the brunt of every hail, 
Yet still you burst forth, unwilted. 

O Rose, so solitary, 
I seek your rare nowhere, 
In crushed hopes and fragile dreams.
