In the stillness of twilight,
colors blend and bleed,
life pauses, breath halting,
as if absorbing this ephemeral
blend of pink and purple skies.
A moment suspended,
a heart thundering,
wondering what comes next,
as the horizon stretches,
inviting day to dusk,
a cyclic embrace of existence.

- Margherita Sarfatti
