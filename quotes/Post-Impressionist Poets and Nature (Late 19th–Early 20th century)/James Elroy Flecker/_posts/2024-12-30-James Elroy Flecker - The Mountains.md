The Mountains

Stand timeless, mountain, grand and true, 
With all the storms you’ve ever knew, 
And overlooking the valleys wide, 
With every shade of light, your pride.

You cradle earth in your embrace, 
A silent strength, a sovereign place; 
In every echo, dreams reside, 
The whispered prayer of time applied.

In you, I find what life can be, 
Both frail and fierce, in harmony; 
Together intertwined, we stand, 
In nature’s tale, forever grand.

- James Elroy Flecker
