Frosty Morning
The dawn breaks with a quiet sigh,
Frost paints the world, a silvery tie.
Each blade of grass, a glittering gem,
Morning whispers secrets, soft as a hymn.

The trees stand tall, adorned in white,
Guardians of silence in the soft light.
Nature awakens, her beauty unfurled,
In the stillness of winter, a magical world.

- Alexei Kruchyonykh
