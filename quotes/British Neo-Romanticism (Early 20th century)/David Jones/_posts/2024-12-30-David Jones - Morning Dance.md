Clouds drift like dreams in the azure expanse,
Where the lark in its glory begins to dance;
A quilt of green clad in morning's soft light,
The earth takes a breath as it yawns into sight.

The scent of the rain is a lover's caress,
As the foliage shimmers in nature's finesse;
With each rustle and whisper, my soul takes wing,
In the cradle of daylight, my heart starts to sing.

- David Jones
