Wild Geese

You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.
Tell me about your despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
Meanwhile the world goes on.
Meanwhile the sun and the moon,
those two ancient travelers,
are back home again in the sky.
Each day, I think about the lives I rescinded,
each thought of yours.

I cannot see you, but I hear you.
You spoke with the light from the stars last night.
It is enough.
I can find you in the mystery of the wild geese,
of the trees, the lilies.
How far they travel across the sky.
And I ask you again,
where will I find you, love?

- Mary Oliver
