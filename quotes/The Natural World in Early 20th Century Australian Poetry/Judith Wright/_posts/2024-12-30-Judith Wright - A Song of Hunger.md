A Song of Hunger

From the belly of the earth,
The cries of man echo,
A longing for the wildness of life,
Yet the land cries in silence.

Yet around every tree,
Behind every rock, behind
Every face silhouetted against the sky,
The truth runs strong, wild,
With the pulse of nature.


- Judith Wright
