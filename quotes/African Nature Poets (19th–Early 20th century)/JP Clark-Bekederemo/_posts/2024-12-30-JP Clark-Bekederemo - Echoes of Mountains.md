Mountains reach for the heavens,
Majestic, ancient, grand,
Their stories carved in stone,
By nature’s patient hand.

With valleys rich and fertile,
And rivers running clear,
They cradle life within,
In a dance that draws us near.

Let us walk these pathways,
Underneath the sun’s warm glow,
For in nature’s embrace,
The soul learns to grow.
