Nature
By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

I love the fireside at evening,  
When all my books are within reach,  
And nature calls with gentle voice,  
From backwoods and from silent BEACH.  
The wind that haunts my soul,  
Whispers secrets of the trees;  
As twilight’s gleam from the stream,  
Swatches softly the rustling bee,  
And the magic lingers away.
