A Forest Picture

I stood in the forest, alone and amazed,
In the flow of a silence, where whispering leaves
Spoke of the wonders all gathered around,
In a canvas diverse, the elms in their sleeves.

Beauty a bounty, their branches a shroud,
In sweet harmonies woven of emerald threads,
They cradle the thoughts of the soul's agape, 
As sunlight abode on the fountain in reds.

O Nature! thy children, united by sound,
Through the foliageâ€™s breath in sweet radiance bound,
Manifest clearly the love of your trees,
In the softness that merges with treasures profound.

- William Cullen Bryant
