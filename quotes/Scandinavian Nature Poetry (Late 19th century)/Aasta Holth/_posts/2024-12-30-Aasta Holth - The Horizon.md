The Horizon
At dawn's first light, the horizon glows,
Where earth meets sky in warm embrace,
Each fading star like a story shows,
In every dawn, we find our grace.

A promise waits just out of sight,
In every color, hope renews,
Beyond the dark, beyond the night,
The horizon sings in vibrant hues.

- Aasta Holth
