The Sun

Look up! The sun in autumn shines,
With warmth a gift to coldest days,
It paints the trees in gold designs,
And lights the path with its pure rays.

Each ray a brush against the earth,
A swathe of colors spread so wide,
As nature speaks in vibes of mirth,
The sun, a gentle, guiding tide.


- Edward Thomas
