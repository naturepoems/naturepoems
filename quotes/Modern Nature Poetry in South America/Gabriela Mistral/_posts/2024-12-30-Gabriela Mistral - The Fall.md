The Fall

When autumn comes I hold on;  
the sun glints low,  
casting long shadows behind  
as leaves disperse and die.  

Yet not all is lost;  
vibrations exchange with gusts  
while tired cottons blue,  
a tale of hunger in motion.  

I enter the twirling of dreams,  
rice blooms beneath twilight,  
searching a sigh for a heart,  
for fear brushes the day.  

What I won’t walk on,  
life’s memories split in pieces  
like a gathering of oranges,  
you know they surrender measles.  

A sigh on old soil,  
a garden recounted echoes  
at the heart of fall.

- Gabriela Mistral
