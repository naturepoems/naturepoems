Light bowed to all that seas,  
A bending down where gold threads wrap  
Around the earth alone,  
As hewn  
In the locks of time—  
To twirl, to twist;  
Where every blushing bloom  
Sprouts to dance around its world!  
Let us lay between  
And water whirl  
Till calm is breathed  
Upon the echoing tongue of air,  
All waves will meet the hour!  
As if earth drifts on  
Flowing in wetness away,  
Lifted beneath  
A glimmering sky,  
At once to touch the freedom facing  
Mixing busy rocks and calm trees  
As nature blends—  
From all,  
Here lies the land!  
With blooms and color being—  
And red,  
Is brightened, whole.
