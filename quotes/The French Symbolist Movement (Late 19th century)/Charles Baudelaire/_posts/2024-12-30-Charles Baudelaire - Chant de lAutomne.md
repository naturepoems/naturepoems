Chant de l’Automne

Beneath the cypress, in the solemn wood,
I dared to whisper to your shade, forlorn.
As leafy breezes ruffled all the greenery,
I mourn like a lost sparrow at fading dawn.
.
For with every falling leaf, O Nature,
Each stifled cadences the world still speaks,
You sing back sweet and sad as death,
Lovelier than the hum of sadness your music reeks.


- Charles Baudelaire
