The Dream of a Fallen Leaf

A leaf trembles down,
Its journey a silent tale,
Flirting with the breeze
And bidding farewell to the tree.

In its descent,
The world transforms,
The dance of life,
An intricate play of nature's whim.

Falling, it wonders
Where it will rest,
In the embrace of earth
Or a forgetting stream.


- Jorge Luis Borges
