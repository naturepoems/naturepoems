Echoes of the Wild

In the echo of valleys where shadows creep,
    The wild calls softly to me,
Whispers of mountains that never sleep,
    And the spirit of wildness set free.
The song of the forest, a symphony pure,
    A melody sweet as a dream;
In the echoes of nature, the heart finds a cure,
    Basking in her gentle gleam.


- Alfred Domett
