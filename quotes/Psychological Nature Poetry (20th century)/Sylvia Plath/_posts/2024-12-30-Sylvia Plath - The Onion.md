What a thrill—
My thumb instead of an onion.
The top quite gone, 
Except for a sort of
Stem—and now
A bulb of white,
Reaching down,
                       Strong, 
     Anchored,
   In the ground.
I wonder,  
Just what it sees
              In its dark,
And what it knows
                  That I do not.

- Sylvia Plath
