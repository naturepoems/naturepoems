Landscape with the Fall of Icarus  
 
According to Brueghel  
when Icarus fell  

it was spring  
 
A farmer was ploughing  
his field  
 
The whole of nature  
had been in bloom  
 
In the sky  
 
The sea was quiet  

and the veins of Icarus  
 
And it was spring  

Just like that  

Wooed too soon  
for an unforgiving day.

- William Carlos Williams
