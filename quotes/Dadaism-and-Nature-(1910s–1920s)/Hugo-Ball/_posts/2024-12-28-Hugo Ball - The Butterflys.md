The Butterfly’s Secret

A fleeting ballet of wings,
Colors carried on whispers,
Journey from blossom to blossom,
With gossamer grace, pure serenity,
Unlocking the heart of the garden,
In pursuit of nectar, the sacred truth.

It hovers, it twirls, it escapes,
Mirage of life unfolds,
In sunlight’s soft embrace,
Dreams mingle with the air,
A promise embraced, kissed,
In every moment, transient and brave.


- Hugo Ball
