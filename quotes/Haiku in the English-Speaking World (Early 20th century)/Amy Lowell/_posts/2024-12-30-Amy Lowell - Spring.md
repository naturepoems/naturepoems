Spring

This is the time of the year  
When the mint and thyme are waking  
With the warmth of the sun.
The yew trees stretch their long, thin arms  
In the delicate air of spring,  
With a white mist drawn across the land  
Like a dream gone cold.

I stand looking at the grass  
And thinking of getting home,  
What dark figures are needed inside  
The house that it might stand  
Against the storm of this wind  
And the bitter salt of the sea?

- Amy Lowell
