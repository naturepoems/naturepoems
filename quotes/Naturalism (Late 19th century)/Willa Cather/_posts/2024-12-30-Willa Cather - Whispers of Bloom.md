A world wrapped in wonder, awake from its dream,
With flowers that whisper in sunlight’s warm gleam.
The rustling of leaves, the soft babble of streams,
Nature’s sweet spirit enchants with her beams.

For every sweet rose that unfolds to the dawn,
A story of life, of triumph, and brawn.
In the woods and the meadows, through thickets they weave,
Life breathes in a language that only hearts perceive.


- Willa Cather
