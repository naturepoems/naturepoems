The Earth

I dream of the earth, clad in colors rare,
Where mountains rise and valleys bow,
The clouds speckle the blue skies rare,
Brush strokes of nature's wonder vow.

Each whisper through the wind a thread of song,
Woven through the waltz of trees and grass,
In unison, they tell where all belong,
A tapestry where the living souls pass.

- John Masefield
