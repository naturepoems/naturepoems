I Dream a World

I dream a world where man
No other man will scorn,
Where love will bless the earth
And peace its paths adorn.

I dream a world where all
Will know sweet freedom's way,
Where greed no longer saps the soul
Nor avarice blights our day.

A world I dream where black or white,
Whatever race you be,
Will share the bounties of the earth
And every man is free,

Where wretchedness will hang its head
And joy, like a pearl,
Attends the needs of all mankind—
Of all the weary world.

I dream a world where all
Will know sweet freedom’s way,
Where love is like a bird in flight
And peace will find its day.

—Langston Hughes
