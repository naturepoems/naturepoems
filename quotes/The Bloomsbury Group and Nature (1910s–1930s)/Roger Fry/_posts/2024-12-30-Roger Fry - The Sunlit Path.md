The sunlit path through tangled wood,
 Each step a promise, understood.
 A symphony of birds in flight,
 As shadows dance with pure delight.

 The morning mist that starts to clear,
 Breeding the hope of day so dear,
 With each new breath, the world awakes,
 And nature sings for all our sakes.


- Roger Fry
