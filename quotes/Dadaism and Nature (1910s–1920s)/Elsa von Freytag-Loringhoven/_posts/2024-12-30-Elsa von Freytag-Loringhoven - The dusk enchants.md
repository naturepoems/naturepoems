The dusk enchants,
   and every grassy tuft
   is a riot
   of fastened teeth!
   Petals bloom obstinately,
   while twigs bare husks,
   throwing themselves
   into the breezes’ arms.
   Memory of a tree,
   colonized by insects --
   adrift, yet
   sprouting madly in twilight.

- Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven
