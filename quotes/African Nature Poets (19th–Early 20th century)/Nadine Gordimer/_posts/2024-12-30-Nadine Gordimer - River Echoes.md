Through the valley,
forgotten echoes of child laughter,
follow the river,
which flows like hearts intertwining,
whose current remains unbroken
though stones have been tossed among its depths,
each ripple a fleeting moment captured.

Let us sail upon the waves
of this gunmetal blue,
floating to the chorus of the world,
for in its sway,
we learn the art of becoming—
of nurturing resentment into acceptance,
of the vastness of beloved lives.

- Nadine Gordimer
