Noon

The bright washing hangs  
To dry on sunny trees,  
Like flags of the morning floating  
Across the spire of noon.

The leaves are painted deep green,  
Each stem is soft with gold,  
And the breeze plays softly here,  
Lulling me into dreams,  
While the world rolls away  
Into the laughter of floating clouds.

- Amy Lowell
