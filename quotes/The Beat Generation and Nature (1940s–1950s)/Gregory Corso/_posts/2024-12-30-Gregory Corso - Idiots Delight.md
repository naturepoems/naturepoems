Idiot's Delight
by Gregory Corso

You’ll never find me,
I’m hanging on
by two hand jobs
while the waves
make sand into soft silk.
Elation! How the breeze
whispers sweetness,
rounding my numbers,
each simple mold
melting into seashells,
every pebble a thought,
- an idiot of the heart
in a child’s kingdom,
a junkyard in the zen.
I’ll take you to the edge,
sing you into oblivion,
you’ll share my head
of colored glass,
a chewed-up soul
like the ocean line,
dreaming only of love,
nature, rocking meticulously
on a’ driftwood’ couch.


- Gregory Corso
