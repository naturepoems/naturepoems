The Cloud

I am the daughter of Earth and Water,
And lofty Sky: my mother is the Night,
The spirit of the Moon. In my heart,
Thou that art, behold my form. Alone,
But unoppressed, I wander over forests,
Nurturing the life of the universe.
These flocks and herds delights for my gentle ways,
And full of wonder I glance as I pass—
O my woods and harbours, ye abodes of fame!  
— I chase the rolling waters, and the lull
Of mighty mountain valleys spreads above
A watery mist; through the rain I taught the earth pensively.
And when the storm is still—ther my heavy heart lifts.
Upon the wild, bright seas my dreams arise,
And be I yet again a sea, a cloud, a gypsy!

— Percy Bysshe Shelley
