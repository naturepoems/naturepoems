A single raindrop falls, 
a whisper from the heavens,
a connection to the universe.
It lands softly on my palm,
like a tiny promise of life.

The storm clouds gather,
painting the sky in dramatic shades,
as the world prepares for the dance of rain,
a celebration of nature's bounty.
I sway in the rhythm,
allowing the rain to cleanse my soul.
