An ocean of stars blankets the night,
Each twinkle a messenger of dreams;
The universe echoes an ancient truth,
Carried on the wings of the moon’s soft rays.

How small we are beneath this vast expanse,
Yet our essence flows with the tides above;
Tethered to the wonder that fills our souls,
Loss and love entwined in nature’s arms.

- Anna de Noailles
