Beneath the arch of ancient trees,
Where the brook sings its liquid song,
I sit upon the verdant grass,
And let the world slip away.

Here the pace slows, as if held still,
In the gaze of a gentle breeze,
And with every breath of the wild,
I am cradled in nature’s whispers,
Lost in a dream spun from green.

- Richard Aldington
