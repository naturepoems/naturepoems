The Four Quartets

East Coker

I
In my beginning is my end.  
In succession, houses rise and fall,  
Cut off from water, growing fragile.  

The oak tree hit by lightning.
The air is full of them, beyond imagining.
The soul's journey unfolds.  

II
And the light is gone out of the sky.
Since the first man stood beside his silent skull;  
And night gathers where we are.  

III
Shadows of trees, thin and undulating.
What was in the beginning?  
The light remains upon us.
Be still, be still.  


- TS Eliot
