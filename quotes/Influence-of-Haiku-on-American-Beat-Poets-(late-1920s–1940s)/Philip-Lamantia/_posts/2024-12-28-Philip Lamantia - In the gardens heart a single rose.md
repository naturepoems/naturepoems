quote: "In the garden’s heart, a single rose blooms,  
Its petals unfurl like secrets spoken,  
Fragrant whispers in the afternoon sun,  
A reminder that beauty, however brief,  
Can pierce the soul, a fleeting joy found."

In the garden’s heart, a single rose blooms,  
Its petals unfurl like secrets spoken,  
Fragrant whispers in the afternoon sun,  
A reminder that beauty, however brief,  
Can pierce the soul, a fleeting joy found.
