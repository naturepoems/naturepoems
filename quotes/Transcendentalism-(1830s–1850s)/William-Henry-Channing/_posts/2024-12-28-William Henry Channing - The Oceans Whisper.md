The Ocean's Whisper  
 
Gentle waves caress the shore,  
Each one brings a tale of yore;  
The salty air, a sweet embrace,  
Invites my soul to find its place.  

In the rhythmic dance of the tide,  
I lose my cares, my fears subside;  
Here, in the ocean’s vast expanse,  
I find my peace in nature’s dance.

- William Henry Channing
