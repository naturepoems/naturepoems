In fields of green the wildflowers burst,  
With petals wide and colors bright;  
Each bloom a song in praise rehearsed,  
The day awakes with pure delight.  
Mighty oaks amid the grove,  
Stand guardian to the skies above;  
While windside whispers weave and rove,  
A sacred sound, a tale of love.  


- William Holman Hunt
