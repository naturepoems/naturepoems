What does the sunset whisper,
As colors bleed into the night?
Each hue a brushstroke on the sky,
Where day is kissed by stars so bright.
In the horizonâ€™s softest glow,
Where dreams and daylight intertwine,
Nature spins her celestial tapestry,
A sign that all will be divine.
In every shade, a memory lives,
Of moments stitched in time's embrace,
As the world slows to a tranquil hush,
I find my solace in this place.

- Marina Tsvetaeva
