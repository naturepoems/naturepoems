In the pulse of the river,
in the singing of stones,
the sound of my heart
merges with nature,
no borders, no limits,
a gathering of dreams.

Eels glide by,
while the fish leap, misty,
a dance beneath
this blue-green expanse,
a language of water
that speaks to those
who dare to listen.

Nature is a whisperer,
a confidant,
a map in our hands,
a wild song,
a cascade of stories,
a treasure waiting.

- Cecilia Vicuña
