Eurydice

I know you are there;
Your face would move in the air,
And the night would stir, 
When the great pine twigs crack, 
Wrapping my thoughts tight
Within their soft embrace.

Out of the dark,
With a dreamer's heart to perceive,
Yet my steps are lead
By the silver wind and moon.

Is it desire you seek? 
Or mere futility,
In the garden of fate,
Where the whispers flow?

â€” H.D. (Hilda Doolittle)
