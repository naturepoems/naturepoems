Corn
The sun is warm, the sky is clear,
  The air is filled with golden light;
The cornfield stands so proud and sheer—
  A world transformed in summer’s might.

The waves of green in the harvest dance,
  And rustling whispers greet the morn;
In gentle hearts, the deep romance,
  Of silence heaven-born, forlorn.

- Sidney Lanier
