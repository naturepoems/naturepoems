This Compost

Something startles me where I thought I was safe,
We are all blended into the rich earth,
Where the lush summer blooms brightly arise,
Where the trees hold the sun to sprinkle down kisses,
And the flowers spread the whispers of their colors.
Let the falling apples and the mature fruits,
Let us be sunny and blessed, as the world springs anew,
Show us the depth of nature, without question or fear,
Open your hearts and breathe again amongst life’s compost.

- Walt Whitman
