The fields await with arms outspread,  
Where golden grains caress the breeze,  
Each ear a story, softly said,  
Nature's chorus, the heart's great tease.
  
Underneath the open skies,  
The dance of days and dusk collide,  
In every heartbeat, life rushes by,  
Nature's passion, our stubborn guide.


- Friedrich Hölderlin
