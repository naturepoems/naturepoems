Over the river, and through the woods,
  To Grandmother's house we go;
The horse knows the way
to carry the sleigh
Through the white and drifted snow.

Over the river, and through the woods,
  Oh how the wind does blow!
It stings the toes,
and bites the nose,
As over the ground we go.

Over the river, and through the woods,
  To have a first-rate play.
Hear the bells ring,
'Tis Christmas Day!
  …

Over the river, and through the woods,
  Now, Grandmother's cap I spy!
Hooray! for the fun!
Is the pudding done?
  Hooray for the pumpkin pie!
