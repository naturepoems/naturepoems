The Garden

In The Garden, there dwell thoughts,
Of soft winds and dappled shade,
A scattered light that deeply caught
The emerald blades unafraid.

For life unfolds in every flower,
In the weave of fragrance spun,
And holds consumed the quiet hour
When all at rest has just begun.

Find us once and yet again,
In the stillness of the earth,
Where nature's hand, like a friend,
Shows the secrets of its birth.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
