Mountains rise like sentinels,  
touching the heavens,  
crowned with the frost  
of ancient winters.  
The valleys cradle flora,  
a mosaic of life,  
green and thriving,  
a haven for the creatures  
that dance in shadows,  
beneath the canopies  
of towering trees.  
Every rock and crevice holds  
the whispers of time  
where the earth breathes slow,  
inviting the heart to listen,  
as the wind carries tales  
of ages past,  
in this wild sanctuary.

- Lanford Wilson
