In fields of gold where wildflowers sway,
The sun dips low, the close of day,
Each blade of grass, each rustling leaf,
Is nature's artâ€”beyond belief.

Here, time stands still, the world awakes,
In every breeze, in every sound,
A symphony that nature makes,
A harmony where peace is found.

- Eleanor Dark
