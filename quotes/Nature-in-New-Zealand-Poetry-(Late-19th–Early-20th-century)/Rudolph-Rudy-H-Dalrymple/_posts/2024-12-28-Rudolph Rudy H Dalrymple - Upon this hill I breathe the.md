Upon this hill I breathe the air,
Where springtime winds caress the leaves,
And laughter dances in the glen,
While nature spins her endless weaves.
They paint the sky in hues of blue,
As flowers bloom with fragrant grace,
Each petal whispers soft and true,
In harmony, the world’s embrace.

Oh, quiet woods, your shadows speak,
With mysteries in every breeze,
The babbling brook, the mountain peak,
Awakens senses, grants us ease.


- Rudolph Rudy H Dalrymple
