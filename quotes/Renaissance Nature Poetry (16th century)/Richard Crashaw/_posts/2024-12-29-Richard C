The Sunset

As the sun dips low, the horizon glows,
With crimson rays that sweetly flow,
In amber, gold, the day concludes,
In such soft hues, the world renews.
A moment still, before the night,
In twilight's grace, I feel the light,
O fleeting time, thy beauty holds,
In every sunset, a story unfolds.

- Richard Crashaw
