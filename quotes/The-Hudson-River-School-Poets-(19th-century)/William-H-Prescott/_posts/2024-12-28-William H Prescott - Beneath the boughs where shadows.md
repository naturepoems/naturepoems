Beneath the boughs where shadows linger,
A stream reflects the sky's embrace,
In whispers soft as night grows thicker,
The world is held in nature’s grace.

Each ripple tells a tale of old,
A journey shared through time and space,
In simple wonders, life unfolds,
In nature’s arms, we find our place.


- William H Prescott
