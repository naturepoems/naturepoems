Through ancient woods, I start to tread,  
Where echoes whisper, softly said.  
A journey paved with every leaf,  
In nature’s arms, I find belief.

The rocks may crumble, rivers part,  
Yet in their depths, I find my heart.  
For every step, I learn – I grow,  
In nature’s wisdom, rich and slow.

- Vera Brittain
