The Sky

Beneath the endless vault of blue,  
I feel the weight of ages past,  
And in the clouds that drift and sway  
I find my spirit, free at last.  
The sun’s warm touch, the moon’s soft glow,  
Are guides upon this journey true,  
In the vastness of the sky above  
I find the universe in you.

- A E George William Russell
