The Cliffs

The cliffs arise from the restless sea,
Standing proud against the sun's embrace,
Where waves collide with mighty glee,
While birds aloft in freedom trace.

With every crash, new tales unfold,
Of treasures lost and journeys found,
In nature's arms, the spirits bold,
The edge of dreams where hearts abound.

- John Masefield
