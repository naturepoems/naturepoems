The ocean unfurled its arms to me,
A canvas of blue, so wild and free;
Waves lapped against the shore's weary feet,
A rhythmic pulsing, nature's heartbeat.

The horizon kissed by the sun's last rays,
As twilight settled in with a gentle gaze;
The whispering tides sang secrets untold,
Stories of sailors and dreams made of gold.

- David Jones
