The Encounter
Through the trees, a soughing,
  A lowing in the dark—
The warm evening like wine.
  The broad, wide-ranging boughs;
      Mist blows like salt
   In the presence of a beast!  
The hare in his quickness,
   Spring is overpowering.
     Our love discards speed:
We drift in the moonlight.
      The brooding tree resounds,
  A little more to gather;  
Every leaf comes fluttering down,
   Little still creatures; 
I love what the wind would collect!

- Ezra Pound
