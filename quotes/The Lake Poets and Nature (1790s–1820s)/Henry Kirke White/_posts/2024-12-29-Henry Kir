The Seasons

O! how fair is the morning's bright blush,
   When the sun's golden rays awake the day,
And the cool dews of night in the quiet hush,
   Flee away on the wings of glimmering play.

Each season has its tint, its voice, its tears,
   The winter's bleak snows, the summer's soft sigh;
Yet all unite in Nature's kind spheres,
   Where Life and Beauty in harmony lie.

- Henry Kirke White
