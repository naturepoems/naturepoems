The River
The river—
Is it not a deed of God,
That everlasting miracle?  
And if we go away,
Shall we escape its song?  
O echo on the summit,
O spirit in the depths!  
Let us remain—  
Ah, forever!  
And let our lives pass.

Like the stream that dwindles,
As the sun falls low,
To the infinite shore—
Where the sea awaits us.
