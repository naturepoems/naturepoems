The Opening Rose

A rose unfolds beneath the sun,
With petals soft and fragrance spun,
In nature’s gilded, gentle light,
Life’s whisper blooms in pure delight.

As bees weave through in gleeful dance,
The air is filled with love’s romance,
In every color, every form,
Beauty rises, pure and warm.

So let us pause and seek the grace,
In nature's heart, we find our place;
For in the rose, a life will show,
The beauty sings where love must grow.
—Louis MacNeice
