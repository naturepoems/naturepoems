Eurydice

You will go back,    

and I will not be here  

and I will call to you,  

and you will listen—  

but step not back,          

for the blossoms  

that side of the borders    

are not for you.  

Until they fall  

and the leaves are dry,  

and till the warmth  

and sound returns,  

I lift your name  

from the earth  

to the world  

and lose it.
