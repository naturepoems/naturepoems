The River
Twisting, turning, the river flows,
Its silver skin in sunlight glows,
Carving paths through rocks and trees,
A living song upon the breeze.

Reflecting skies of changing hue,
A tapestry of green and blue,
The river sings, a sweet refrain,
In its depths, the world remains.


- Antonio SantElia
