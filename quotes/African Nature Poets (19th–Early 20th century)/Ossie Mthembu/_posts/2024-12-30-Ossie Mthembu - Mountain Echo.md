Mountain Echo

In the silence of the mountain,
Where echoes find their home,
Each call reverberates,
Through the peaks that loom.

Nature's voice a symphony,
Carried by the breeze,
In the heart of the wilderness,
The spirit finds its ease.

Oh, gentle mountain whisper,
Guide my feet and soul,
In your embrace I wander,
In your strength I become whole.

- Ossie Mthembu
