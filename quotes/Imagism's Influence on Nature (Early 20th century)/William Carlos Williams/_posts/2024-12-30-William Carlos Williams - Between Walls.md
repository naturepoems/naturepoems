Between Walls
The time was perfect,
bird)
our functioned life,

returns life
between walls,

in the proper color—

between this,
holding flesh,
wood colors,
a beater rimmed

and hoarse of iron,
a sweet symphony solved(line,

when we listen along all paths
turned bright before the sky.

But nothing beloved

could bulge from
said by wonders.

Let us then crush the sky,
coming out.

Be calm—open air.

Above—the quiet.

Lower down, (bird) 
observed to lift inches away.

The roof waits,
right calm—a long night.
Evening!

- William Carlos Williams
