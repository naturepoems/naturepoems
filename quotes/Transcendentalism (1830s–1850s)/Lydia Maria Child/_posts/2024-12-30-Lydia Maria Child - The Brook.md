THE BROOK

The brook sings merrily,
Under the grace of trees,
Its laughter ripples softly,
With winds that dance with ease.

It tells of distant mountains,
And valleys far away,
Of rain upon the meadows,
Of birds that gleam and play.

It leads a happy current,
Among the reeds and flowers,
Oh brook, thy sweet enchantment,
Gives joy to summer hours!

- Lydia Maria Child
