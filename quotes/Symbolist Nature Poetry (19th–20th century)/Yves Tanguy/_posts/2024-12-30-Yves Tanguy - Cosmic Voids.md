A cascade of stars spills through the night,  
Their twinkling eyes a watchful gaze,  
Over valleys wrapped in silver light,  
Nature’s cloak, a soft ethereal maze.

In the hush of night, the world stands still,  
As dreams take flight on wings of air,  
With every breath, the heart's own thrill,  
In silent whispers, a cosmic prayer.


- Yves Tanguy
