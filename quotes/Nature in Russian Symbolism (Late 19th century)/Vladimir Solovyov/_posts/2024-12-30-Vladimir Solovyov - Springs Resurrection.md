The springtime blooms, a vibrant burst,
With each new leaf, the earth is cursed;
Yet dance it will, in colors bright,
A testament to nature's fight.

Life finds a way, in every form,
Through winter's chill, spring will transform;
In every petal, life restores,
Nature whispers, ‘Here are your doors.’

- Vladimir Solovyov
