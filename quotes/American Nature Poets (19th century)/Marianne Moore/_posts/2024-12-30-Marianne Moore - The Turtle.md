The Turtle

When the turtle slips away,
With slow certainty, down the bank,
Into the lake's placid, jeweled embrace,
Time stops, and the rhythms return,
While water slides softly over her shell;
Her grave cadence exalts our essence,
Silent, still in her sacred repose,
Where beauty meets the liquid flow,
Leaves swaying, undulating with breeze.

- Marianne Moore
