The Nightingale's Song
Beneath the moon's soft silver gaze,
The nightingale begins to praise,
With notes that weave through tranquil air,
A melody that frees the care.

In darkness deep, her voice a guide,
Where tender heart and hope abide,
In every note, the world takes flight,
A song of love, a balm of light.

- Mieczysław Wojnicz
