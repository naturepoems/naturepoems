With whispers of twilight,
The chill of the air,
The moon’s silver laughter
Unveils everywhere.
In the forest, the owls
Now sleep in their flight,
For the lull of the evening
Brings the stillness of night.

With each gentle shadow,
The softness of peace,
As the world wraps around me,
And my worries release.
So here in the starlight,
I take in the night,
In this sanctuary of nature,
Where my spirit takes flight.

- Emily Carr
