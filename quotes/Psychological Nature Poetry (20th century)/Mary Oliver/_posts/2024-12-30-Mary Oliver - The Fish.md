The Fish

I caught a tremendous fish  
and held him beside the boat  
half out of water,  
his gills were opening like  
a suitcase and he weighed  
a hundred pounds.  
And I thought of the heavenly  
fish  
that had swum onward,  
leaving me just this one  
it was enough to appeal  
to my mind and I wondered  
if I would let him go,  
if I could be safely back in love,  
look trending to find  
a description to make him whole.  
Just as the light turned  
i let him go,  
so many dreams  
turn without our even knowing.

- Mary Oliver
