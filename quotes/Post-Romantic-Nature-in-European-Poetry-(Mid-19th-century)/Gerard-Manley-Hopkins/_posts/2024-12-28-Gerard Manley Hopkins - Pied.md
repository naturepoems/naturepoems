Pied Beauty

Glory be to God for dappled things— 
    For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim; 
    Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches' wings; 
    Landscape plotted and pieced—fold, fallow, and plough; 
    And áll trádes, their gear and tackle and trim.

All things counter, original, spare, strange; 
    Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?) 
    With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;  
    He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change: 
    Praise him.

                                                        -- Gerard Manley Hopkins, 1877
