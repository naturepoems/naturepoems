In twilight’s embrace, the world quiets down,
As crickets sing softly, a lullaby near;
The stars peek out shyly, igniting the night,
In this still, sacred moment, all worries disappear.

Shadows stretch long as the day bids farewell,
And the moon takes its throne in the sky,
Here in the silence, my thoughts start to mend,
In nature’s own rhythm, I learn how to fly.

- Sigbjørn Obstfelder
