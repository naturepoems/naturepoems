The Arrow and the Song

I shot an arrow into the air,  
It fell to earth, I know not where;  
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight  
Could not follow it in its flight.

I breathed a song into the air;  
It fell to earth, I know not where;  
For who has sight so keen and strong,  
That it can follow the flight of song?

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
