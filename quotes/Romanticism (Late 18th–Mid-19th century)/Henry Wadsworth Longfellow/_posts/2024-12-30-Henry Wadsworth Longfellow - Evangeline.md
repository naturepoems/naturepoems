Evangeline

This is the forest primeval.  
The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,  
Bearded with moss, and in garments green,  
 indistinct in the shade, were standing.

The air is filled with their whispers;  
Beneath their boughs, I heard the sighing  
Of those who sought for rest, for peace,  
In the shadows under the trees.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
