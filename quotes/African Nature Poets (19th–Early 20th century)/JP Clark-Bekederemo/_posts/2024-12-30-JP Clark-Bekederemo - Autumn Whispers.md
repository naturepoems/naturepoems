As autumn leaves come falling,
Like whispers from the trees,
We gather ‘round in circles,
With memories like the breeze.

Each hue a rich reminder,
Of warmth before the chill,
In nature’s grand transition,
We find our spirits still.

Let us embrace the changes,
With gratitude and grace,
For every season teaches,
Life’s beautiful embrace.
