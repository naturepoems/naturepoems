By the Shore

Upon the sand, the waves kiss feet,
A dance of tides, a lover's moon,
The ocean hums a song so sweet,
In every rise, a shifting tune.

The shells, they cradle secrets tight,
In glistening treasures, lost to time,
As seagulls call, and hearts take flight,
The shore invites with rhythm and rhyme.

So stroll along, let worries fade,
In salt-kissed air, the world draws near,
For nature’s grace shall never trade,
The joy found here, the ocean’s cheer.

- Clara Wadel
