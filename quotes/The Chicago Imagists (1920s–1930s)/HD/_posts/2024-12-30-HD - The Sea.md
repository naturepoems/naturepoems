The Sea

How can I name you,
like sea foam rise,
or the soft comb of cloud;
let me strive to touch this love’s steep tide?
For the child is again; in a burst of hope,
a cool net of thorns,
a stretched hand warms;  

turns from the winds,
yet still to grow up in green night,
for the sea, I can surrender;
how sweet the cool waves come,
salute the dawn and bring herbs new.
Here is the touch of the Sea,
which lightly falls,
to help me rouse the sand again.
