When autumn’s breath paints leaves of gold,
And whispers secrets to the trees,
The stories of the earth unfold,
As nature sways in harmony’s breeze.

The crispness in the air ignites,
The brilliance of a season's close,
In every shade of waning lights,
A beauty in the stillness grows.


- William H Prescott
