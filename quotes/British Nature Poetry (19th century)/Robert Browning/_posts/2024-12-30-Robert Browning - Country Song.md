What a place is the country!
With its free fresh air,
And the place where I was cradled,
And the heart of the land close by!
Oh, it’s a fine fair world,
And I’d choose it anywhere;  
From the bustling town,
I’ll take my flight!
Among the blooming flowers
In the rich meadow land,
I’ll lie down and rest my head.
And be lapped in tranquility,
'Twixt the woods near the brook,
Where the wild flowers bloom,
And the birds sing loudest!
Oh, I love the country!

- Robert Browning
