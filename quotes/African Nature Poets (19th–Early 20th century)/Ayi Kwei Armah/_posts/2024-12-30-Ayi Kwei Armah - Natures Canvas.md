The earth is a canvas, 
    painted softly by the rain, 
    rich browns of soil, 
    splattered gold from the sun’s grace.  

The trees sway gently, 
    whispering secrets in the breeze, 
    their leaves a symphony, 
    rustling, dancing in 
    Nature's embrace.  

Mountains stand proud,
    guardians of the horizon, 
    cradling clouds upon their peaks.
    Rivers, like veins, 
    pulse through the land, 
    their waters carrying stories, 
    from the heart of the earth.  

In this sacred silence, 
    a bird sings, 
    each note a droplet of joy, 
    a reminder of life,
    so pure and so free, 
    in the arms of Nature, 
    we find our way home.
