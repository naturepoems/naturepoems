As locomotion leads the swells of tidings,
Go let us seek the still of nature’s ways.
For peace is where whirlwinds and storms find land,
And let the forest close its gentle hand.
   For stillness calls her sweeter sound, a blue,
   That peace flows from the rotation of hue.

   Be bared in heart where waters have stirred,
   Where the wildest learn to clasp in twine,
   To spring from skies where coral stands unheard,
And vast braves meet in embrace to dine.

— Nature’s Way

- William Shakespeare
