In the silent light of the evening,
the river flows,
each drop a story,
each ripple, a sighâ€”
water weaving through stones,
carving paths into the earth.

I watch as stars emerge,
pearls scattered on the aching surface,
twinkling tales of the infinite,
a universe mirrored in the quiet depths.

- Octavio Paz
