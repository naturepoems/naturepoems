Summer Sun

O summer sun, with thy golden crown,
                Rest thy beams upon the grass,
Bathe in radiance the lilies down,
                As the clouds of the evening pass.

The valley whispers, the river flows,
                Waxing bright in twilight's glow;
A hymn of peace through nature goes,
                In the land where I love to go.


- William Morris
