The Ascension

A wind has swept from the sea, and has laden the woods with the
morning stir
And the sighs and whispers of life are swelling in green under the
sun. 
In the fading notes of that hour that arise, I see the seraphim
olives, 
And behold, they walk with reveal'd steps, and pass; to the blue and
the tear; 
Now am I with a vision on high derived from my joyous throne, 
To read the wonders of footfalls that gently breathe; 
Tis all the question within me, throughout—that our love so free,
Should arise to be so real. 

— Percy Bysshe Shelley
