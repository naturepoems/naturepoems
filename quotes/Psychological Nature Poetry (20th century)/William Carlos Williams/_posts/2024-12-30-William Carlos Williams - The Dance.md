The Dance

I

not about to die  
but rising  

for the first time into  
this breathing  

not the waltz  
nor the tango  
but  

unashamed, free  

with no fears of  
interruption  

as the trees dance  
in the woods  
or  

the wind's invitation.

II

a sense of  
joyful giving  

and receiving  

that I have not known  
before.

III

how we sing  
how we dance  

like the twigs  
that touch the surface  
of the lake  

in so many patterns  

under the sun  

and my mother moves  
to the dance  

as if caught in its open  
grim jest.

- William Carlos Williams
