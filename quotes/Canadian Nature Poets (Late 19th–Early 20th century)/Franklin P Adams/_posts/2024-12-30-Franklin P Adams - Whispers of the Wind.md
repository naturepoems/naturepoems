Whispers of the Wind

The wind, it speaks in murmurs low,
Through rustling leaves, a tale does flow,
Of distant lands and skies so clear,
A language only hearts can hear.

It carries scents of pine and earth,
In nature’s soft, enchanting birth,
With every gust, a whisper true,
In every breeze, I search for you.


- Franklin P Adams
