Some say, the whispering breeze
Is the great speak of love,
From where tender doves,
From the maple trees above.
I ponder the silence,
And warmth of the day,
As nature's great beauty
Carries my heart away.

It is the trust of a flower,
Amidst the green chime,
The roots deep so secure,
In this sweet little climb,
I stand here enchanted,
Humbled and still,
For nature's pure presence
Awakens my will.

- Henry David Thoreau
