Earth's Lament

Below in the earth, a quiet cry,
Where stones wear their silence slowly,
And roots cradle the ancient whispers
Of the grass and moss, green and furry.

All grow in circles, tendrils winding,
Beneath the sky's blue embrace,
Where clouds drift like dreams, unbinding,
The threads of time in this sacred space.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
