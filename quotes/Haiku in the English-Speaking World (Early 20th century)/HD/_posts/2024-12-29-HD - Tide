The waves crashed
against the shore,
a melodic heartbeat,
a dance of the ocean,
underneath the endless sky.
Seagulls cried,
a cry of freedom,
as they soared high,
mapping invisible routes,
in their quest for the sun.
With each tide
comes a promise,
a whisper of change,
of ancient secrets,
woven into the sands,
of the ever-moving sea.
