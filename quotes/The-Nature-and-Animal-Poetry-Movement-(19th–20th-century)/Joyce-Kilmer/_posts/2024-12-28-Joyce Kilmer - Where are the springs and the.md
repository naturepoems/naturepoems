Where are the springs and the brooks,
The streams and the rivers flowing?
Pale moonlight shines on the books,
While the wildflower wakes from its blowing.

And the night is so dark, so deep,
The woods so full of secrets, so flowing,
The willows in clusters that weep,
And the shadows of silence growing.

- Joyce Kilmer
