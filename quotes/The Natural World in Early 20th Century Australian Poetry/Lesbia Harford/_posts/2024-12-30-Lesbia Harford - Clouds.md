Clouds

Tremblingly low, the clouds came down  
Over the hills, 
And the westerly wind bore them  
Like a flock of white sheep.  
But southerly winds, stooped low,  
In the lowlands, streets of rain; 
Where the flowers and grasses will be 
With a wave of the glimmering light between:  
The sun casts them up to the azure heights;  
Here, there is nothing of death, but their life!

- Lesbia Harford
