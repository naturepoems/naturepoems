The Book of Hours: I, 1

I want to be with those who know
All the beautiful things — all that our
Mortal hearts can touch with grief and joy.

In flame and honey, in the light
Of deep plants that bloom through the winter,
In the tenderness of spring's return,
Let these poets teach me.

For the sky, so wide and quiet,
Enfolds a world of sweet rushing
And quiet skies above the trees.
I want to know the secrets of their peace.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
