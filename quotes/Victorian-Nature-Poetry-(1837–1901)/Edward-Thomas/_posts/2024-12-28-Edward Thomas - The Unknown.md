The Unknown Bird

There is a bird that sings that could never be known.
All wanderers hear the tune and can recognize,
But the essence of those notes is like purest foam
Beyond the babble of our very own skies.

At dawn, an echo from the gray-tipped trees,
The soft absorbing notes that flow like streams,  
Do move closer to the heart than wind;  
Beyond the brambled thicket of our dreams.

O, long forgotten song from far away—,
Reveal thyself, and come to me alone.
To all the listeners, I am afraid to say,  
In solitude I shall make the song my own.

— Edward Thomas
