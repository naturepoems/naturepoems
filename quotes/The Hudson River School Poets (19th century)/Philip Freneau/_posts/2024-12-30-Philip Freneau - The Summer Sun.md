The Summer Sun

Upon the field, in golden glow,
The summer sun begins to play;

It bathes the earth where blossoms grow,
In radiant hues that softly sway.

A gentle warmth, a kind embrace,
Brings life anew upon each climb;

With every ray, a sacred space,
In nature's arms, fulfilled by time.


- Philip Freneau
