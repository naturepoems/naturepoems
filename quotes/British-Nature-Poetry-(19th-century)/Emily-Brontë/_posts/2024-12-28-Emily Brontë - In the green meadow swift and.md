In the green meadow, swift and bright,
The flowers of spring refuse to fade:
Each quiet hour, they lift their light,
In nature’s law, their balm is made.

With every breath the world’s a prize,
And yet in gloom I feel despair;
As still they bloom, devotion cries;
The beauty grows, yet I’m stripped bare.

O sweet ye flowers, who hear my sigh
And lift me to thine offering view,
How will I guard this spirit high,
When winter wreaths ye, too, in blue?


- Emily Brontë
