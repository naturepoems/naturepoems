The sea is  
A living thing;  
It heaves and groans,  
Tossing its weight  
Upon the shore,  
And calls back again,  
The tide  
Bending and swaying,  
Gentle yet fierce,  
With its  
Endless voice.  
Into these depths  
I could remain  
Forever swept away,  
Yet return to land,  
Flesh yearning  
For salt, for soft sand.
