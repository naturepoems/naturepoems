In the Woods

I love to walk in woods, to see 
The grandeur of the trees,  
To feel the whisper of the breeze, 
And hear the wild birds sing in glee.

The canopy above, a leafy dome,  
Through which the soft sun glimmers rare, 
And at my feet the mossy loam, 
Where a golden light falls everywhere.

The ferns in all their beauty spread,  
And the delicate flowers blush and gleam, 
Under the oak's thick, rustling head,  
I find the solace of a dream.

A tranquil mind, a heart at peace,  
In nature's lap, my cares release.

- Archibald Lampman
