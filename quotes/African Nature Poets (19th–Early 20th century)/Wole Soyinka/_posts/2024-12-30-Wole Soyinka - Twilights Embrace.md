Twilight's Embrace

When dusk falls softly,
Carpeting the world in purple,
I watch as the horizon, 
Drips colors from a painter’s brush.
The day exhales its final breath,
Kissing the earth goodnight,
While stars begin to sway,
In the womb of the coming night.

In that moment divine,
I sense the world breathe slow,
Every creature quieting,
Underneath the silver glow.
Twilight’s tender embrace,
A lullaby of dreams,
Where even shadows find solace,
In the beauty of moonbeams.
