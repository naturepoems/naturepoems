Flow on, thou wonderful stream,
With silver fingers, touch and gleam,
In thy crystal embrace we find,
A mirror to the soul, unconfined.
Dance with the light, the whispering breeze,
Wrap us in moments, soft as these,
In reflection, where silence meets,
The harmony of nature's beats.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
