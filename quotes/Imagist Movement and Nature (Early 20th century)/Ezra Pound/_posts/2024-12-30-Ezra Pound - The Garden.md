The Garden
In a green haze, the conduit of trees,
And flowers; flowers of rain,
That unfold rich earth tones through the thornbush,
Raindrops like the sound of all coming near.
A place of twilight emerged calm
Under the weight of nests,
Sultry views and meadows
That dance with a pale wind—
My heart, that introspective wind in winter’s waste!
A fragrance of beauty draws its lines,
The sea, where blossomed dreams break against shore.
This, this we guard,
An open space,
With light folding over.
Oh, life leaps up
As if into the skies!
Here let us dwell!

- Ezra Pound
