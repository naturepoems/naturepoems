A Marshland Elegy

In the marsh’s immensity and repose
Shadows unfurl from the moonlit skies
And dance on the silvery waters below,  
Where the cruel heart of time softly sighs.
The reeds in the murmuring wind softly sing,
Of the cycle of death and life anew—
Let your soul tremble, for the night will bring,
Unfolded music for the heart to pursue.

And, lo! the night-bird with shadowy feather,
Hushed on the planet of stars so bright,
Whispers, and serenades echo together—
Symphonic dreams in the hush of the night.
For Nature’s vastness hold tumultuous grace,
As time unwinds in this sacred place.
—Sidney Lanier
