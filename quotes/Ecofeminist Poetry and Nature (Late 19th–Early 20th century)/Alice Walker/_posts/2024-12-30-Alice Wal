Our Sisterhood

Beneath the moon’s soft glow,
We gather, united,
The sounds of nature invite,
Each heartbeat a call,
A dance of the spirits,
Reflecting the beauty of our souls,
In the moonlight quilted,
With petals and stars.

Our sisterhood bends,
Under the burden of history’s weight,
Yet like the dandelion’s spark,
Still we dare to dream,
Loving fiercely the earth,
With every shade of our histories,
As we rise, like a breath of wind.

In the woodlands and the wilderness,
We share the lore of seasons,
The rain, the sun, and the tide,
Each pushing us forward,
A testament to our fire,
We are dawn, dusk, and eternity,
The very essence of life’s unfolding tapestry,
Rising through the echoes,
Of all who came before us.

- Alice Walker
