Spring

     To me,                
     it is a hand,
     a hand like a flower.

     It is not a flower,
     a leaf,
     a blossom set like a cup.

     It is
     a gesture,
     it is
     something,

     in a country
     so washed,
     with a pearled light,
     under the blood of the sun,
     â€”who could understand this light?
