The garden breathes its fragrant charm,  
As butterflies flit by in glee;  
The bees are humming soft and warm,  
Adding music to the trees.  
And in the stillness of the air,  
The flowers bow their heads with grace,  
As if the world in perfect prayer  
Is gathered at this quiet place.

- Bliss Carmen
