The Return of the Rain

How sweet the sound of raindrops,
As they serenade the ground,
Each patter, a gentle kiss,
In a symphony profound.
The earth drinks deep from heaven,
In a dance of pure delight,
And blooms arise in joy,
As day melts into night.

The rivers swell with laughter,
While the air breathes life anew,
A chorus of creation sings,
In the freshness of the dew.
These moments, sublime and fleeting,
Are nature's proud refrain,
Let’s celebrate the beauty,
In the return of the rain.
