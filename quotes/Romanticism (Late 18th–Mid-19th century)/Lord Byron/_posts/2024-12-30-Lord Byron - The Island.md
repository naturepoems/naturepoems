The eye of man hath not seen the world,  
As beautiful as Nature’s hand;  
For though all men seek her,  
Her charms alone hold the forward glance;  
From thine own voice is the passion poured,  
In the brook that summer leaps  
In thy dear name,  
O nature, bounding bright, so wild and free!

- Lord Byron
