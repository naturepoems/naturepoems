I am not a poet
of the mountains, nor the sea,
nor of the birds that fly
high over them. I am a poet
of the smallness of things,
of the lichen on the rock,
of the dew in the grass.

I am a poet of the low
and the humble, the things
that live in the dark, unseen,
that do not shout,
that go their quiet ways.


- R S Thomas
