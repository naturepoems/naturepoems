Oread

Whirl up, sea – 
whirl your pointed pines, 
whirl your crags with precipitation;  
create in me 
a mountain  
that shall be a foundation  
for the rocks that are made.

Bring me your snow  
for a mantle  
for my leaning;  
bring me my stillness  
of the snow;  
breathe in the violets –
breathe in the stallion  
that I seek –  
I am yours,  
yes,  
yes, I am all your  
wind;  
all your birches  
creeping in crouch,  
leaning over night,  
tell your trailing pine -  
for you are the unmade!

O, You, hail! You shall see me,  
your high shepherd,
your far light.
You light  
it serves,  
your screen,  
your meaning  
to my vision!  

Whirl up, O sea,  
whirl!  
A man called Adam  
throws himself to the earth like a  
dried  
leaf and is uncrowned by you.

Unmade like the caught fish
that turns,  
built by your hands,
by your sea, built by you.
