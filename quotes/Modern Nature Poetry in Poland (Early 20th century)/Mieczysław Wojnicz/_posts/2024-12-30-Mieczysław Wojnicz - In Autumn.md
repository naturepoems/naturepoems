In Autumn
A world absorbed in amber light,
Leaves whisper secrets to the night,
Beneath the trees in quiet grace,
The earth wears gold, a warm embrace.

No longer dances summer's song,
In twilight's reach, the days grow long,
As branches bow to the gentle breeze,
The heart finds peace among the trees.

- Mieczysław Wojnicz
