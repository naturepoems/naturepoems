Burnt Norton

I
Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future,
And time future contained in time past.
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable.

Time past and time future
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present.

II
I must be cruel only to be kind:
Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
This is the proverb, my love,
I wish I could write you a letter.

III
The river flowed on, and he watched,
Only a fish and some small birds were present
In a world stripped to the bone.

IV
In our end is our beginning.
In our time, we will not be saved.

V
And where are we, my friend, as our lives unfold?
We are the guardians of the light, in the end.

VI
Poetry is on the edge, and
Starlight trickles down in our fleeting dreams.
Do we not hear the grass whistle \nWhen the winds of autumn loosen
All our songs?  
Do you know the fields?


- TS Eliot
