Evening Glow
The day retreats, the twilight glows,
As evening wraps the earth in robes,
With shadows long, and colors fade,
In softest peace, I'm unafraid.
The stars will shine, the moon will rise,
A promise whispered through the skies,
In nature's arms, I find my rest,
Embraced by beauty, truly blessed.

- Louise Imogen Guiney
