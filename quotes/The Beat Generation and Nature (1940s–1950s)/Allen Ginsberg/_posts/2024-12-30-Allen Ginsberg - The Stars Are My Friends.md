The Stars Are My Friends

Tonight the stars whisper,
   a soft wind carries their secrets,
It feels like all of time is turning,
An embrace of night,
The trees and the world reflect our hearts,
The pulse of nature beats strongly,
    breathing with us in harmony,
What splendid friends they are,
   illuminating our path as we walk along,
