Poem on a Sunday Morning

I look out
the window at the
    morning hills.
The dew is bright on the grass,
    and the trees are green.

I see
    Fluffy cats
        playing in the park
Johnny has a new kite,
    he shows his friend,
            so good and strong.

Sunday morning,
    the best time of the week,
    a little breeze is
    across the grassy hills,
and I am at peace.
