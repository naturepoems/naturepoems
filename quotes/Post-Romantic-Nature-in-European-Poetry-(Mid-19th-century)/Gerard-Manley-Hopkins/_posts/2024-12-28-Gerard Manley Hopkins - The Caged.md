The Caged Skylark

As a dare in the clouds, 
    So high from this earth’s floor; 
    The wildness in flight brings wonder playing at 
    Both heart and eyes; 
    Surely a slight thing ought to be, 
    Not robbed of our smiles. 
    But alas there is much to break within.  

And yet, as I approach from clouds at last, 
    You twist, curl, and dwell  
    With whispers—all life must learn, 
    Without a care for freedom 
    In our biggest thoughts; 
    Or in slight spirits we learn  
    To brave, we must again with sorrows contend.

                                                        -- Gerard Manley Hopkins, 1880
