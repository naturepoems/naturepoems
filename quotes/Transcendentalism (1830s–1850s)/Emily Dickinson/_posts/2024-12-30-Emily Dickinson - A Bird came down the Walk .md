A Bird, came down the Walk –  
He did not know I saw –  
He bit an Angleworm in halves  
And ate the fellow, raw –  

And then he drank a Dew  
From a convenient Grass –  
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall  
To let a Beetle pass –  

He glanced with quick, bated breath,  
As I went out to see –  
If there was any other one  
That I could see –  

I had concluded, when  
I heard him sing a song –  
My heart -It seemed  
At once to fall right back –  

Then he flapped his wings  
And I looked the other way –  
“For a little fellow, he was bold  
To carry that away.”

- Emily Dickinson
