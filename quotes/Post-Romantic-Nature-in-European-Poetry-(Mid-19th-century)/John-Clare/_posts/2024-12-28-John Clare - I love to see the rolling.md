I love to see the rolling hills,
The grassy meads and the shady rills;
The leafy woods, and the singing birds,
The mellow notes of the rippling words.

My heart beats high with the summer sun,
And joyfully I see the deer run.
The flowers bloom in their rich array,
And light the path of the sunny day.

- John Clare
