The water's surface shimmers,
Catching the breath of the stars,
As the willows weep gentle colors,
Into the dark blue embrace of night.

I scatter pieces of my dreams,
Upon the water's mirror,
Letting the universe collect them,
In silence, in magic, in awe,
As night surrounds the land with warmth.

- Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
