The Mountains
The mountains rise in stately poise,
With majesty that stirs the soul;
Their peaks break through the clouds' soft noise,
And set the weary heart console.

Each crag, each vale, a tale of old,
In patient silence, whispers true;
Their presence, vast, serene, and bold,
Invites us to reflect anew.

In Nature’s hands, our journeys sway,
With every summit, dreams take flight;
We find, in towering heights, the way
To grasp the beauty of the night.

—Charles Tenney Jackson
