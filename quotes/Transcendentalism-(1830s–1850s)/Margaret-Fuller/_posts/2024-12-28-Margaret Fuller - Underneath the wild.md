Underneath the wild sky,
With stars as our guide,
In the stillness of twilight,
The earth and I bide.

The mountains stand tall,
Upon their aged toes,
Silent and wise,
With stories they chose.

The rivers converse
With the oaks on the shore,
Revealing the secrets
Of what came before.

Beauty abounds,
In the thicket and glade,
An echo of love,
Forever displayed.
— Margaret Fuller
