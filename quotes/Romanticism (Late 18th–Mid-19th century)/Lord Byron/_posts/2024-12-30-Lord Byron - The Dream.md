There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,  
There is a rapture on the lonely shore,  
There is society, where none intrudes,  
By the depth of the sea, and the breadth of shore;  
Though I may roam, and my heart will see,  
A world in lonely wildness, a beauty free.

Wild is the sea; and the wind, like a bird,  
Flutters and plays with the foamy spray;  
Delighting in its own wildness, unheard,  
These sounds fill the heart with joy and dismay;  
In these solitudes, as day melts away,  
Nature is darkly fair, sublime and gay.

- Lord Byron
