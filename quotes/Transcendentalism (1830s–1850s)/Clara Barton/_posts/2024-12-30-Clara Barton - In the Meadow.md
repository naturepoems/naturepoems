In the Meadow

The meadow blooms with colors fair,
A palette stretched upon the earth;
Where butterflies flit here and there,
And every corner speaks of birth.

The grasses sway in rhythmic play,
As whispers of the wind arise;
And all around, in a sweet ballet,
Nature unveils her bright disguise.

- Clara Barton
