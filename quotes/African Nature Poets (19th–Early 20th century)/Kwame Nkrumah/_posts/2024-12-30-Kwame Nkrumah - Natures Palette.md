Nature's Palette
Nature paints with colors so bold,
From emerald greens to sunset gold.
Each petal a brushstroke, each sky a hue,
In the garden of life, a masterpiece true.

With mountains for canvases and rivers for lines,
In every creation, beauty shines.
A tapestry woven in silence divine,
In nature’s embrace, the soul starts to shine.

- Kwame Nkrumah
