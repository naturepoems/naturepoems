Upon the Mountain's Crest  
Upon the mountain’s crest I stand,  
And gaze upon the valleys wide,  
Nature’s palette at my hand,  
In hues of cream and dappled pride.

The clouds above, like dreams alight,  
They dance with sun, and in embrace,  
All wanderlust within takes flight,  
To chase the winds on glory’s face.

Each peak, a sentinel so grand,  
Each rock, a tale of time’s embrace,  
In rugged beauty, I understand,  
The heart of earth, the sun’s warm trace.

So let me linger here awhile,  
On sacred soil, in silence blessed,  
For Nature’s love, her endless smile,  
Shall fill my soul with joyful rest.

- Richard Crashaw
