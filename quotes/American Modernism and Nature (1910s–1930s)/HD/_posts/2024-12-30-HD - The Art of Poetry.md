The Art of Poetry

To make a poem
   is to make light
     that brings
     a secret of the day,
    transform the dew’s pearl
    catch the fold
    of shadows,
   to create; each petal,
   light as minerals,
   beckons in a whisper—
—is bright, yet
source; a shifting pulse,
like the night’s birth,
becoming tenanned dew  
—where ocean fades,
   let every word
   rest
bound in things,
    do not lose the word!
    —H.D.
