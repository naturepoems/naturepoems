AN AUSTRALIAN CHILD
When I was a little child
    My mother said to me,
  ‘Always call your neighbour
    By some kind name, you’ll see’;
  And so, throughout the years—
    As a child I learned it well
  ‘O, will you not remember
    The father, who loved so well
  The dusky shadows of the gum,
    The pale-rimmed coast so blue?
  And all the wild-hearted, wild creatures
    That wandered out in the dew.’  

Then outside on the garden path
  I played with the wattle flowers,
The whispering winds that haunted me  
  Were friends through all the hours.
  And when I railed against the fates
     Like any other child,
  ‘O, give me in the wilds the hills’
    I cried out on the wild.

But every year importance
    I crowned myself with leaves,
  For I thought of all my mother’s words,
    And made me free of griefs;
And climb, climb the mountains near,
    Free as the midst of the wattle trees,
  And slowly I grew ancient
    And wandered more at ease.
