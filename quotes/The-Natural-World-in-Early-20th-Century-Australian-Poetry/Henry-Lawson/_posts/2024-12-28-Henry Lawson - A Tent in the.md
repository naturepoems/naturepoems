A Tent in the Bush
The wild winds are blowing,
The leaves are a-shiver,
The roof is a-gaping
Where the rain drips and rivers.
I look at the walls of an old tent, no more
But the stars are my lanterns, the sky my door.
At dawn comes a tussock, the bird sings, and flies,
And there in the stillness the sunrise re-tries.
When the night comes a-calling, I cherish the glow
Of my flickering campfire, wild nature's show.
And the wind harms the canvas, and the rain splashes down,
But here is my castle, my fortress, my crown.

- Henry Lawson
