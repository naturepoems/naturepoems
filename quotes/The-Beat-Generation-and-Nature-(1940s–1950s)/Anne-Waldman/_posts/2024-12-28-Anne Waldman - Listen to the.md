Listen to the trees
Whispering secrets,
Crumbling leaves underfoot,
As me and the earth,
Spin slow dances among the ferns,
And embrace the wind's serenade.

The sparrows know,
as do the clouds,
dancing between realms,
Of concrete and dreams,
Where the spirit of the forest,
Meets the soft breath of cities.


- Anne Waldman
