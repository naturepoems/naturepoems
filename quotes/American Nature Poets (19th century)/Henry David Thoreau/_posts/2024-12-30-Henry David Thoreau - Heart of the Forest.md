In the heart of the forest,
Where time pulls no strings,
The days stretch forever,
Like insistent wild wings,
Swaying to the rhythm,
Of all things alive,
There lies the true essence,
In natureâ€™s soft drive.

So let me be cradled,
In the bosom of trees,
Where whispers of secrets,
Carry songs on the breeze,
For here at this moment,
All is vibrant and true,
I seek wisdom in silence,
As the world comes anew.

- Henry David Thoreau
