The Mountain  
  
  
The mountain stood, a sentinel,  
With rugged face against the skies,  
It held the clouds upon its brow  
And listened to the eagle's cries.  
  
In crags of ancient granite bare,  
In lichen hues of emerald's grace,  
It sang its ballad to the wind  
And watched the world below its face.  
  
A monument of stone and time,  
To dreams of man, to nature's power,  
In silence deep, with strength so vast,  
The mountain blooms in Beauty's hour.

- EJ Pratt
