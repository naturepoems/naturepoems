From the dark chambers of the heart 
Emotions suffocate, sad art; 
Yet from the heart, through nature's frame,  
The wildflowers bloom, a living flame.

The gentle zephyr sings along,  
In every tree, a whispered song; 
Let nature's hue my spirit fill,  
With love's embrace, my heart's still.

- Charlotte Smith
