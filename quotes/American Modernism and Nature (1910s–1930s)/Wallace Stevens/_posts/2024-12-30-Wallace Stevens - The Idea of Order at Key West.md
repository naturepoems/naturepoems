The Idea of Order at Key West

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind
Of man but, in her singing,  therein
The voice of the sea shaped the trembling
Of a woman, framed alone in her uncertain nature.
The ocean resonated around her, saw her
As an artist weaving meaning out of the sound.



- Wallace Stevens
