No Second Troy
Why should I blame her that she filled my days
With misery, or that she would not take
The blame of misery from this wandering man,
That faced the ruin of his fate—
Until the sun and moon fell side by side?

I have heard her say that there is no such peace
But that a lover's touch was like a burning star.
And though I know the tireless moon is sweet,
In the general sameness is the poet's dream all night.

Fierce and petty the hearts of men, and clear.
When you take from the faintness of a night
No second troys for the thoughts counted, mean,
A peace is never for victory, or in gentle reviews,
And the shame wrought in each man's heart derives.

Cloister your flowers; they will blossom in the dark,
And foster pains is no preface for eternity. I have
Had her high glow that shall reveal her own defeat,
And in this wager bears the hand.

Why should I blame her when that life flows clear and bright?
Why hold a soldier for each darkened site?
Love as she does may contain its high store,
But regrets come swimming where hopes arise,
And the night-hunger only stirs like snakes.

Round me in their coils alight, can you hold back the dreams?
In the fate not saying it more, yet going in the ranging night.

- William Butler Yeats
