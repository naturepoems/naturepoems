The daisies dance upon the hill,  
A sea of white, so sweet and still,  
They nod their heads to the gentle breeze,  
While bees hum softly among the leaves.  
In this moment, time stands still,  
As if the world has lost its will,  
To hurry by, to rush ahead,  
For beauty lies where flowers tread.

- Ellen Ballance
