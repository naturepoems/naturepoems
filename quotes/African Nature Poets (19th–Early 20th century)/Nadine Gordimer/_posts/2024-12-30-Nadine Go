The wildflowers bloom against the stone,
a burst of color where least expected,
a gentle rebellion in the face of adversity,
a testament to beauty's unyielding spirit.

I gather their essence, a whisper in my heart,
that life can thrive in barren places,
and even in the harshest environment,
color finds a way to break through.

- Nadine Gordimer
