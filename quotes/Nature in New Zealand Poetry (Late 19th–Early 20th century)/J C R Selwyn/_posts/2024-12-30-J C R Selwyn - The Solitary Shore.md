The Solitary Shore
On the solitary shore, I stand,
Where waves caress the golden sand,
With sea foam dancing on my toes,
And whispered tales the ocean knows.

Each crest a fleeting breath of life,
Reminds me of the world’s sweet strife,
In every ebb, a moment’s grace,
A tender kiss on nature’s face.

As tides retreat, I feel their pull,
A quiet longing, heart so full,
For on this coast, where wild winds play,
I find my thoughts begin to stray.

O solitude, you teach me well,
In nature’s chapel, I will dwell,
For on this shore where waters meet,
I find the pulse of my heart's beat.

- J C R Selwyn
