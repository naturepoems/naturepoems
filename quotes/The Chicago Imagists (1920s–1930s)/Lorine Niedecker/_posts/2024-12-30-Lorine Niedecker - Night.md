Night

The night glimmers through branches like lace — 
     while stars, 
          fumble at forgetfulness.
A breeze whispers secrets,
      and tree trunks hold subtle notes 
    from the drowsy earth.
My eyes flicker with dreams,
      hold hope in the dark,
           at the edges of the sleeping skies.

- Lorine Niedecker
