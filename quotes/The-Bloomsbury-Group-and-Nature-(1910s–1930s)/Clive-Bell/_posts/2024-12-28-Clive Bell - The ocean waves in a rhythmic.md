The ocean waves in a rhythmic dance,
With salty air and a wild romance.
Seagulls cry as they soar above,
In this vast expanse, nature’s love.

Footprints made in the warm, soft sand,
A fleeting moment, a gentle hand.
The horizon blurs where water meets sky,
In the arms of nature, we learn to fly.

- Clive Bell
