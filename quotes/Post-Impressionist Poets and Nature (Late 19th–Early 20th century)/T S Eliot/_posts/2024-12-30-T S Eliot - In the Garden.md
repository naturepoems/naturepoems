In the garden where blossoms unfurl,  
   Time seems to linger, as petals swirl.  
   Fragrant roses and lilies stand proud,  
   Their beauty magnified, a tribute loud.
   
   In the stillness, the world fades away,  
   As sunlight spills golden, at the end of the day.  
   The heartbeat of nature, soft and profound,  
   A sacred reminder, there's peace to be found.

- T S Eliot
