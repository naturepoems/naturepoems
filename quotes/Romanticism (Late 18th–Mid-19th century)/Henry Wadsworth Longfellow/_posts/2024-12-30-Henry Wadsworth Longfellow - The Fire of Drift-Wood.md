The Fire of Drift-Wood

It was a dreary night,  
The winds were howling without,  
When at last we made a fire,  
Of drift-wood, casting about.

And as the flames took flight,  
The embers glowed like stars,  
A warm embrace from nature’s heart,  
In the silence, not a scar.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
