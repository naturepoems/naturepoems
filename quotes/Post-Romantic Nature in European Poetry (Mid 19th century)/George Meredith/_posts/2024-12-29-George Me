The Morning Star

In dawnâ€™s embrace, the morning star,  
Is lit upon the world afar;  
With every ray, a promise made,  
As night recedes, and fears allayed.  

There, beauty stirs in colors bold,  
A tale of many lives retold;  
The morn awakens all to see,  
The splendor of the day, set free.

- George Meredith
