The Ocean

Oh vast expanse of azure sea,  
You hold the dreams of every shore,  
With waves that lap in endless dance  
And secrets that speak of yore.  
In your depth, my heart finds freedom,  
In your roar, a sacred song,  
For I am one with your wildness,  
Where I truly belong.

- A E George William Russell
