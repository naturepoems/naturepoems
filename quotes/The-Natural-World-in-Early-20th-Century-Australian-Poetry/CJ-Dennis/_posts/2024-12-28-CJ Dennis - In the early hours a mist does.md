In the early hours, a mist does rise,
Veiling the landscape where silence lies,
The trees loom tall, cloaked in white,
And the world holds its breath in gentle light.

The dew-kissed grass shines like a dream,
Reflecting the glimmers of the still stream,
With the promise of day dawning anew,
On the soft, sleepy earth washed in blue.

Nature unfolds in slow, sweet grace,
With every moment, a sacred space,
And I breathe in the calm of the waking day,
Grateful for life in its wondrous display.
