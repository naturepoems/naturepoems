The Poem

Has no choice
of subject matter

but to
sing

of what is

with the birds

with the trees

with the moon

with the women

and the other great

creeping things

and the life

of being.

Listen to the never

ending song

that beats on my heart.

Oh! how

it makes one

want to spring in

as on a train

that whistles past

wherever you’re going

wherever you cal.

Now!

- William Carlos Williams
