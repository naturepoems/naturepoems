A meadow spread wide, a canvas of green, 
Where wildflowers dance in the sunlight's embrace; 
Each color, a note in the symphony played,
In harmony sings this beautiful space.
Let me lie here, wrapped in the sun's warm light, 
In this patch of Eden, everything feels right.


- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
