Mountain Flow
the river welcomes all hearts,
flowing over stones, caressing,
a world of comfort, golden notes,
a stillness scattered with songs.

mountains guard above,
whispers tracing the path,
time unfurls its fingers,
reminding us of solid earth,
it will not drown,
spirits rise with the dusk,
everyone needed in the chain
of life.
