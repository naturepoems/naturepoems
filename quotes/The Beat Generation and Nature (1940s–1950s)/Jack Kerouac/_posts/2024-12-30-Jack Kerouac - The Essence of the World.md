The Essence of the World

The world is seen
in a leaf,
in the creek,
and the song of the wind
whispers louder
than the roar of the city.

We built mountains
of steel and greed, 
yet the trees still stand,
the rivers still flow,
and I find my peace
in the dance of the leaves.

Come a wandering soul,
gather beneath the stars,
see it for what it is,
a great and growing life,
not bound by the weight
of our own aspirations.
