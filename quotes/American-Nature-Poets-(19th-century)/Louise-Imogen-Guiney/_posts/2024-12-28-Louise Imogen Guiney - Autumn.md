Autumn Song
In the golden woods, I hear,
The rustling of the leaves, in cheer,
Whisper secrets from the trees,
Carried softly on the breeze.
The sun hangs low, in burning red,
As crickets sing, and sparrows thread
Through every branch and faded bloom,
Creating music, in nature's room.

- Louise Imogen Guiney
