A Quiet Street
Paved by memories, yet calm and deep,
Where nature sighs and lovers creep,
Each house a glance, each window a sigh,
In the gentle rain where dreams lie dry.

Along the street where no one calls,
The quiet whispers through the walls,
Nestled in shadows grace abides,
As nature’s heart within us hides.

- Edward Thomas
