The Meadow
In the meadow, wild and sweet,

Where natureâ€™s laughter and joy meet,

The bees dance lightly, flowers sway,

In harmony, they greet the day.

Here beneath the azure sky,

Life unfolds without a sigh,

In vibrant hues, the beauty gleams,

Each moment holds a world of dreams.

- Richard Jefferies
