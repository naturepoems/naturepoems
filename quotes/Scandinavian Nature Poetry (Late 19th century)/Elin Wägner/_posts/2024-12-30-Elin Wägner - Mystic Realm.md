The forest deep, a mystic realm,
Where ancients wait at nature’s helm.
With every step, the whispers rise,
A symphony of earth’s replies.

The oak stands proud, a guardian wise,
Its branches stretching to the skies;
In every rustle, history speaks,
Of hidden paths and turned-up peaks.

- Elin Wägner
