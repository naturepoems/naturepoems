Home Thoughts from Abroad
  
    Oh, to be in England  
    Now that April's there,  
    And whoever wakes in England  
    Sees, some morning, unaware,  
    That the lowest boughs and the brushwood sheaf  
    Round the elm tree bole are in tiny leaf,  
    While the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough  
    In England—now!  

    And after April, when May follows,  
    And the white throat buds on the apple boughs  
    In England—now!

- Robert Browning
