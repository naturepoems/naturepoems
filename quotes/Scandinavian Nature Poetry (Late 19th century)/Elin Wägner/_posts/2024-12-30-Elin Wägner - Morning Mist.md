In the morning mist, the valleys lie,
A silent breath of dreams and sighs.
Among the trees, the whispers play,
As silvered dew greets break of day.

The river winds through mossy stones,
A symphony of ancient tones;
Each ripple tells of tales untold,
As nature spins her yarns of old.

- Elin Wägner
