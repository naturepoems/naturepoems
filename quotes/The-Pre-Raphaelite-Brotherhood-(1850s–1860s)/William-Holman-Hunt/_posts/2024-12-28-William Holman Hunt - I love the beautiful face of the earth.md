I love the beautiful face of the earth,  
The water and the trees, 
The golden skies;  
To me it gives worth  
From each petal and leaf that blows,  
Stirs in the gentle breeze.  
That silence, under gilded branch,  
Speaks volumes in the lush embrace;  
In every changing hue, a dance—  
The vividness of nature's art brings grace.  


- William Holman Hunt
