Because I could not stop for Death –  
He kindly stopped for me –  
The Carriage held but just Ourselves –  
And Immortality.  

We slowly drove – He knew no haste  
And I had put away  
My labor and my leisure too,  
For His Civility –  

We passed the School, where Children strove  
At Recess – in the Ring –  
We passed the Fields of gazing Grain –  
We passed the Setting Sun –  

Or rather – He passed Us –  
The Dews drew quivering and Chill –  
For only Gossamer, my Gown –  
My Tippet – only Torse –  

We sense the Driver’s Seat –  
He is a Crowned Thief –  
His Company too, is the Grass –  
The opaque Branches – and a little of the Fleece –  

And He’s the only one I see  
And not by Sight – is company Scraps –  
Small and Large – now and then  
Around the Door – I heard a Bird.  

The end – but that’s the other side  
Where all the colors meet  
And baby honeybees  
Feverishly were heard –

- Emily Dickinson
