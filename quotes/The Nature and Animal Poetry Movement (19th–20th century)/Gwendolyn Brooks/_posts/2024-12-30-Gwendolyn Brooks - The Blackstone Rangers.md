The Blackstone Rangers

We are the home
Of the wild and the lonesome.

Here is where the wind
Freely plays among the trees,
And the river speaks,
Whispers my deepest away.

The home of the cosmos,
The universe which spins,
In kaleidoscopic confusion.
Blacked out, white-washed,
A labyrinth.
But beautiful,
In all our sorrows.


- Gwendolyn Brooks
