A Summer Night

The silence of the summer night
  Is like a prayer, that softly falls
From every heart, and is a light
  That hangs upon the dewy walls
And waits to be a star—a voice,
  A spirit, woven in the air,
Inactive chaos, yet by choice
  A hint of beauty, shining fair.

The moonlight drips in silver rain,
  Is caught in every shaded leaf;
The wind, a wistful, sad refrain,
  Blows through the trees—our soul’s belief,
Our tender sorrows, deep and true,
  The very heart that’s back of all.
The night is ours, the stars are few,
  But we can know their radiant call.

—Isabel Ecclestone Mackay
