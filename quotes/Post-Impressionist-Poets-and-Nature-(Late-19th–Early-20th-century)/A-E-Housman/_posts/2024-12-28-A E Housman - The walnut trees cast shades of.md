The walnut trees cast shades of youth,
Grasses dance on a whispered weave,
For fruits of laughter yield us truth,
Under the sight of the leaves.

Nature sings a longing song,
That wraps around each thought we have,
In the shade where souls were strong,
And the quietude’s soft path we’ve drawn.

- A E Housman
