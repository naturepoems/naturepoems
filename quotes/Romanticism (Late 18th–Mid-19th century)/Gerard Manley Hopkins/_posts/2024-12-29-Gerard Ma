From the Antiquary

Where meadows are the gift of come rare
  Stars—Underneath every green   mist, under night’s hold
  The sweet noise heard echoes back as newly blows, 
  Thus first moon-light from moss falls, or the top of the morn?

  True love is blind and free;—and dost thou yet farther stay,
  Resolved, with hills and ripples swelling overhead ports,
  And left to thine heart’s own quest, I do beseech:

  As the fire high on yesterday’s ground burned soft
  And low rows that bow their prayers, he saw unmess’d harms :
  Hours at far longer fall above his mild darts,

  Join’d with flags and  gales spake all at the door to joys,
  Till gladly we sought the golden heart that gazed along,
  The calm, like a haunt of loveliness, from hills beyond,

  That prais’d this deep infinity eclectically the same.

    (Twelve loud echoes sound !

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
