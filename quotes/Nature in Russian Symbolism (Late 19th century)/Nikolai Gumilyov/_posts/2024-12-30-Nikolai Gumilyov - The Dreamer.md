The Dreamer

I dream of forests, deep and vast,
Where sunlight weaves through branches high,
A tranquil world where shadows cast,
Embrace the art of nature’s sigh.

In silent whispers, life unfolds,
As creatures roam beneath the leaves,
The stories of the ancients told,
In every rustle, the heart believes.

Beneath the stars, I find my place,
In the wilderness, my spirit roams,
A symphony of nature's grace,
In every path, I call it home.

Oh, how the rivers sing their song,
As mountains stand, so proud and steep,
In this majestic world I long,
To find the treasures nature keeps.

– Nikolai Gumilyov
