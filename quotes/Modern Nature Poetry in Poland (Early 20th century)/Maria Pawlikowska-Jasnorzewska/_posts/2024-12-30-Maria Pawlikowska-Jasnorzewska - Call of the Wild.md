The call of the wild echoes,
from the depths of the forest,
a siren song of freedom,
and I am drawn into its embrace,
leaving the mundane behind.

Here, in the solitude,
I discover fragments of my soul,
a wildflower blooming amidst the chaos,
a reminder of resilience,
of beauty in simplicity.

Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
