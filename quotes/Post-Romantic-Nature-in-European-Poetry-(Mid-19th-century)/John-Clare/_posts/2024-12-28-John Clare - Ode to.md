Ode to Autumn

I love thee, Autumn, with thy golden smile,
And sun like a jewel in a sapphire sky;
The leaves like rustling gold in the woodlands lie,
And with a peaceful heart I rest awhile.

The harvest comes with its ripening grain,
The fields wear a yellow and smiling face;
As the autumn breezes fill the space,
In the fading sunlight, Iâ€™ll remain.

- John Clare
