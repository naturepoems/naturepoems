The Tree
Oh mighty tree,
What tales you tell,
Of sun and storm,
Of deep, dark soil,
Your roots entwined in earth’s embrace,
You bear witness to time’s measure.

Your branches reach out,
Like open arms,
Offering shade and solace,
To weary travelers who pause
To listen to your silent wisdom,
And count the rings of your life.

- Gabriel Okara
