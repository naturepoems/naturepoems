A day of snow and sun,  
Riding on the edge of the dawn,  
The glorious silence  
Whispers in the trees,
Where their dark limbs bend,  
Cloaked in white secrets,  
And the world is wrapped  
In a soft embrace.

All is serene and pure,  
The glimmer of frost  
Sparkles like stars  
Fallen from the night sky,  
And the breath of the earth  
Rises like a gentle fog,  
An untouched realm of nature  
Basking in the sun's first light.

Yet in this frozen peace,  
A thrum of life persists,  
The heartbeat of the wilderness  
Echoing through the stillness,  
Awakening souls to wander  
In the incandescent glow,  
Where every flake of snow  
Is a note in nature's song.

- Fritjof Nansen
