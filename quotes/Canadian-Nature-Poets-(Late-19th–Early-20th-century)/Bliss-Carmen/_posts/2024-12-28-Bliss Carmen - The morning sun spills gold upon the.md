The morning sun spills gold upon the grass,  
And flowers nod their heads to greet the day;  
Each petal, soft, like whispers, seems to pass  
And dance upon the wind that holds them sway.  
Soft shadows play beneath the mighty trees,  
Where every breeze recalls the song of spring,  
A symphony upon the earth that frees  
Our hearts with every note the moments bring.

- Bliss Carmen
