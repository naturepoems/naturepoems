A Summer Day

O glorified day, for the sun is high,
And the breeze is a voice, and the clouds go by,
In the whispering leaf I, too, do find,
The thoughts of the morn, and the peace of the mind.
  
The flowers laugh lightly to greet the hour,
While the sunlight lingers on every flower,
In the hush of the woods, a delicate strain
Of the choir profound in the sweet, soft refrain.
  
O life of the vale, in the gleam of the sun,
Thou teachest me all that the heart has won;
The mirth of thy glories my spirit doth sway,
In the love of the light on this heavenly day.


- Charles GD Roberts
