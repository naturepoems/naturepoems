Eaglehawk

The eaglehawk is flying high
Above the cool, dry land,
His great wings spread,
The skies bending to his will.

The mountains lie deep
Where the shadows grow,
And the wind that goes around,
Turns and kisses the stone.

The eaglehawk cries,
A call to the moments of my life,
Where silence and noise meet,
In the heartâ€™s open air.
