The Book of Hours

I.

O Wing, where is your power, bravely
setting me free on whatever day?
O Heart: and when night has come,
don't swallow me away in the dark.
Free my heart... So many years,
yet all I see is your grain, 
its total sum alone refusing me clear.
I am too frail; within myself I ought
in my stillness. I trust its doors always. 



- Rainer Maria Rilke
