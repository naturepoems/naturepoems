Spring Pools
These pools that, though in forests, still reflect
The total sky almost without defect,
And like the flower and eyed, show delight,
Conceal a little of their bewildered sight.

To see them will be to hang on the night,
To find the world, once lost, from sound and sight,
Nature will bear me on her little wings,
And lift my yearnings on their silken strings.

So treasure every moment of the day,
As whispers in the fields will ask you why.
There purpose carries each life away,
With every pool now mixed again, bye. 


- Robert Frost
