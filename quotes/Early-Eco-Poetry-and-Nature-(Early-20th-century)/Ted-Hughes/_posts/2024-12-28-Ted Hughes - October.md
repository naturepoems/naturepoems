October Dawn
The hush of our funeral
arrives—
gentle, lilting whispers,
past the frost’s grip,
a kiss of warmth, a trace of color—
like faded petals on the ground.

Each tree bends,
every wing bears witness,
to the calm light lingering,
every shadow stretches long.
The world sighs.

This whispering tide,
it finds us—
a promise yet to unravel,
a new dance to set us free,
where life’s beauty reflects,
in every dying leaf.

- Ted Hughes
