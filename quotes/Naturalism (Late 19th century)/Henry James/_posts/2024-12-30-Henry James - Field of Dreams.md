Among the daisies, hands extended,
In fields of green, the heart is mended.
The sun-kissed petals, soft and true,
Bear witness to the morning dew.

Each breeze that comes, a whisper sweet,
In the quiet earth, where dreams repeat.
Here life abounds, not bound by time,
In natureâ€™s arms, a gentle rhyme.


- Henry James
