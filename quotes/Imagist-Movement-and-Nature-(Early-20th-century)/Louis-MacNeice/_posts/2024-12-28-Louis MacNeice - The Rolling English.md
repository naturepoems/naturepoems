The Rolling English Road
   by Louis MacNeice

The rolling English road that stretches on for miles
Is a maid who can give no breath of her beauty
But steadily takes, not gives, from nature what she finds,
A girl whose arms are empty and a mouth in silence, 
But her naked palette course over ripples of spring,  
And her eyes are the daze of dreams before they fade.

- Louis MacNeice
