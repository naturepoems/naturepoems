A Forest Song
O the forest, the bright forest
In the wilds of Notre Dame!
Thou towering woods of green and gold,
And the flashes of lightning hidden in shadow's frame!
O the whispers of leaves, the rippling of streams,
The call of the wild, in the land of dreams!

Where the giant trees soar to greet the skies,
And the spirits of the forest sing slow lullabies.
Where the wild things dance to the beat of the drums,
And the eagle's cry warns of the danger that comes.

Here nature wraps in her vibrant embrace,
In the heart of the woods, the very heart's place.

Yet, silent lies the hollowed trunk,
Where the laughter of life has splintered and sunk,
O forest, O land, O refuge divine,
In your green arms I seek these thoughts of mine!

- Wole Soyinka
