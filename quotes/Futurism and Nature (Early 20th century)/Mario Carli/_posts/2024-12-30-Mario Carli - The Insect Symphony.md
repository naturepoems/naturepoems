The Insect Symphony
In the tall grasses,
Life stirs with purpose,
Crickets serenade the evening,
While fireflies ignite,
A dance of lights,
The insect symphony,
A hidden orchestra,
Conducted by the hands of nature,
Each note a flutter,
A buzz,
A hum,
Their songs interweave,
In harmony with the night,
A magical tapestry,
Woven in darkness,
Where nature's pulse thrives,
And the world listens
In awe and wonder.


- Mario Carli
