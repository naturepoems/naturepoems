In the Garden

In shaded corners green and wide,
Where roses bloom with tender pride,
A world unfolds in fragrant air,
Each petal holds a heart’s repair.

The daisies nod in playful cheer,
The blossoms draw the bees so near;
With laughter shared on summer’s eve,
In every breath, the joy we weave.

The garden whispers tales untold,
Of love, of time, and dreams of old;
In every seed, a promise sown,
In nature's heart, we find our home.


- Philip Webb
