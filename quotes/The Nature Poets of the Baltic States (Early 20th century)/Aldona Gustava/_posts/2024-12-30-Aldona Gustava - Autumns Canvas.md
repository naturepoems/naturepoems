Autumn's Canvas
Crimson leaves in swirling flight,
Canvas of autumn's vibrant brush,
Whispers of winter close in tight,
Yet in this dance, the colors rush.

Fields turn gold, the air grows cold,
Natureâ€™s cycle spins anew,
Embrace the change, let stories unfold,
In every hue, a world askew.

- Aldona Gustava
