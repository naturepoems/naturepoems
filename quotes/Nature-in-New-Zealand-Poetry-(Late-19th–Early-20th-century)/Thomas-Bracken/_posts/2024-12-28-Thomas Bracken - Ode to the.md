Ode to the Karena
 
In porcelain ripple, across her blue breast,
Carves Nature her smile, in the full light of day;
In the green of her valleys, the sea finds its rest,
The Karena encircles, the waves dance and play.

With splendor of sunlight and coolness of shade,
In the rain's gentle drip, where the silence enfolds,
Where each tender flower in bloom is displayed,
In the heart of her bosom, sweet memories behold.

Oh, wonderful river, how deep is thy grace,
How magical flowing, with untamed delight;
Thy beauty resounding, whilst time dares to race,
In the arms of thy currents, forever take flight.

- Thomas Bracken
