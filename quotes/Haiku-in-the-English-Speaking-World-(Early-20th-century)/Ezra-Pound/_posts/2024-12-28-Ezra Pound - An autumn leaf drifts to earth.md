author: Ezra Pound
quote: "An autumn leaf drifts to earth,  
   swirling in the crisp cool air,  
   whispers of summer's farewell.
    
   The colors blaze - a fleeting fire,  
   nature's palette, bold and bright,  
   before the quiet of winter's blanket."

An autumn leaf drifts to earth,  
   swirling in the crisp cool air,  
   whispers of summer's farewell.
    
   The colors blaze - a fleeting fire,  
   nature's palette, bold and bright,  
   before the quiet of winter's blanket.

- Ezra Pound
