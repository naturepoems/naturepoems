In this fleeting hour,
yellow blooms unfurl,
wrapped in the embrace of eager sun,
where bees, like lace makers,
dance from blossom to bloom,
threading together natureâ€™s fabric.

The garden hums,
it resonates with chatter,
carrying echoes of past and present,
while the breeze serves as a messenger,
glimpses of distant meadows,
where shadows of giants sway.

And beneath my fingers,
the cool earth pulses,
a heartbeat within the depths,
and as I kneel, I am one with roots,
a moment suspended between worlds,
a confluence of sky and soil,
where every touch tells me the sacred tale.

- Lucio Piccolo
