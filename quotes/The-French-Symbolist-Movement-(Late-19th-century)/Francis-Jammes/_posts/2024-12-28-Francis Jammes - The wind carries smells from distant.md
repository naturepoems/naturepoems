The wind carries smells from distant bays,
Over the hills, to croon to the trees,
And in this moment, my heart stays,
Drenched in sweetness like the bees.

With every sigh from Nature’s brow,
I drink the essence of life, deep raw,
In this embrace where I’m anchored now,
A part of the world, connected, in awe.

- Francis Jammes
