Oread

Whirl up, sea—
whirl your pointed pines,
    Splash your great pines
    on our rocks,
    Hurl your green over us,
    Cover us with your pools of fir.

We lift the oars,
while the sea—
        tumbles to the heights,
    Whirls the brown pines
and the ground shafts
of the purple rocked pines,
while we lift our wings
    to the spray of the green-coasted stone.
