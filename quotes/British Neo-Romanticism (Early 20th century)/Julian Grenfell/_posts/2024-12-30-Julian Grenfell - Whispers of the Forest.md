Whispers of the Forest
In the stillness of the forest deep,
Where the hidden creatures roam,
The ancient trees their secrets keep,
Guardians of natureâ€™s home.
Their whispered tales, like softest sighs,
Convey a wisdom profound,
As sunlight filters through the skies,
In this sanctuary, peace is found.



- Julian Grenfell
