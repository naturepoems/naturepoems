The Call of the Wild

To the woods! to the woods!—for here is the joy of it;
I can stretch my limbs and run, in the wild, the wild;
There’s freedom and beauty and the sun shall laugh upon
The freest spirit that ever was born.

The trees speak softly, the brook sings clear,
And everywhere the wildflowers gayly appear,
Joyous are the breaking leaves, the bubbling streams,
The cool, green shade where the wild bird dreams.

There’s no place like this!—no city, no town,
Can give me the joy of the wild wood’s crown.
Here I shall wander, here’s where I’ll stay,
Just me and the wild, till the end of the day.

- John Burroughs
