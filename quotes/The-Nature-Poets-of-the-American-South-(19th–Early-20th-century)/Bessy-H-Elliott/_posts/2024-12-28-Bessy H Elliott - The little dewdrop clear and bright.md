The little dewdrop, clear and bright,  
A jewel on the grass's blade;  
It sparkled in the morning light,  
As if the sun its colors made.  
It held the world upon its face,  
The green of earth, the blue of skies;  
A fleeting glimpse of nature's grace,  
Before it falls and slowly dies.

- Bessy H Elliott
