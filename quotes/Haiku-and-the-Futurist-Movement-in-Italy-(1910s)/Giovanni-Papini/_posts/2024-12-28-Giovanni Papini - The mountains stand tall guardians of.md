Their peaks kissed by clouds, a mystical flight.
In silence they watch as the wildflowers climb,
A canvas of nature bathed in pure light."

The mountains stand tall, guardians of time,
Their peaks kissed by clouds, a mystical flight.
In silence they watch as the wildflowers climb,
A canvas of nature bathed in pure light.
