Snowy Night

The snow falls  
     soft and slow,  
     a blanket for all the sleepersâ€”  
     the moon's gentle kiss  
     brings dreams drifting down.  
     Each flake is a whisper,  
     a memory,  
     a story waiting to be told,  
     as the world glows in white  
     under hushed scenes,  
     filled with wonder and quiet  
     as night wraps  
     everything in its pale light.

- Mary Oliver
