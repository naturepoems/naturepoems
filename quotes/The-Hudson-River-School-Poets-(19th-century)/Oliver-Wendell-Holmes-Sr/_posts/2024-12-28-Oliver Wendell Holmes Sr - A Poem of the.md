A Poem of the Sea

'Twilight was fading in silence,
As night drew down on the world,
Deep in the shadowy heavens,
The silver stars were unfurled;
And the moon of these autumn evenings,
With a hint of the wintry chill,
Rose up through the mist and the darkness
In the azure of bravest hill.

The voice of the sea sounded loudly,
In harmony deep and profound,
From the rock of the immense hillside,
As whispering winds blew around;
And the chalice of tides held softly
A lullaby sweet and rare,
While whispers of love rang softly,
And then faded away in the air.

- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr
