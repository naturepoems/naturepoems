Twilight

Beneath the veil of twilight's grace,
The world begins to dim its light;
With colors fading, shadows trace,
The cusp of day, the arms of night.

In this embrace of soft farewell,
The stars emerge to take their place;
As silence casts its gentle spell,
In nature’s arms, we find solace.

- Clara Barton
