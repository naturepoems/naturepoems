Spring and All
By the roadside
between the property
and the river
I stumbled on a mound
of dark brown earth,
shaped like an old crooked
T.

It was no taller
than my hand,
nor wider
than a man's palm;
inscribed on it
by a thorn,
it bore the dark
of bitter roots,
yet, the sudden
crimson bloom of violets
was enough

- William Carlos Williams
