The valley is no longer asleep,
For the wind has once more shattered the peace.
Hills carved in ancient granite rise,
From which summer drifts and leaves behind,
Expression of her beauty,
Like a lover caressing the old, familiar oaks,
Whispering secrets long kept, forgotten.
The restless streams flow,
Churning with stories, unbounded and wild,
And the trees, like wise old sages,
Stand, the guardians of ages past.

In every flower, a history blooms,
In every brook, a memory plays,
Nature speaks in a tongue so profound,
Only those in silence can comprehend her phrase.

To wander, to roam these vast, breathing lands,
Is to understand the essence of life's grasp,
Both gentle and fierce, like the sun and the storm,
A duality wrapped in the heart of our past.
