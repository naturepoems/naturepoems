Song for the Fish

Raise every voice,  
let it fill the air with joy 
in the ripple of the waves. 
O, my spirits rise 
like arrows to the sky, 
one with the ocean dance, 
to heaven’s call for more. 
The fish glide their silver blues, 
darting in and out, 
every splash of emerald 
like a brush on canvas, 
every surge a melody I can hear— 
blissful—almost a prayer. 
And in the air, the coolness lingers— 
let’s connect with their beauty, 
each little heart, seeking the endless tide, 
sipping the blue for every step, 
the great ocean’s breath upon our skin. 
Let the world fold in there, 
carry each moment, like a songfish. 
Let all arise, 
sweetly unspooled—  
those fish will join us, glittering, 
shining, dancing on their paths, 
so brightly we will follow.


- Mary Oliver
