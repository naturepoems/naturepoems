In the Woods
In the woods where silence reigns,
The air is thick with dreams and pain,
Each rustle of the hidden game
Calls forth the lost, the wild, the tame.

The leaves, like hands, reach up and sway,
As if to hold the fleeting day;
The sunbeams break through branches wide,
To paint the heart with glowing pride.

- Ilya Ehrenburg
