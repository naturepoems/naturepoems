The mountains rise with solemn grace, 
Cloaked in mist, with snow’s embrace.
Their peaks adorned, the sky they trace, 
As silence reigns in this sacred space.

Within the forests deep and old, 
Where tales of nature have been told,
In every wrinkled bark behold, 
The wisdom of the earth, so bold.

Oh, let me roam through fields so wide,
Where streams of joy and peace abide,
In nature’s heart, I shall confide, 
And in her beauty, I’ll reside.

- Andrei Bely
