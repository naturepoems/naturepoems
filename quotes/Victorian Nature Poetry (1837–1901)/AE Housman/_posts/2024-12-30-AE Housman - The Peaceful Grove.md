The peaceful grove, the shady vale,
When wanderers find that things are life,
They hear the echoes soft and pale,
In nature’s peace, away from strife.

Though worries fade as evening glows,
And sunset paints the skies with grace,
In twilight hues, the warmth bestows,
A moment's peace amid the chase.

The layers of the land still sing,
The flowers bloom, as memories come,
While gently forms the approaching spring,
And beckons hearts to feel at home.

- AE Housman
