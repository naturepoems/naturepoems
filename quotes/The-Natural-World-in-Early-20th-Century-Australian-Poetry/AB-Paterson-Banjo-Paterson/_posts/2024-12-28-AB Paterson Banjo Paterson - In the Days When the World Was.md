In the Days When the World Was Wide
In the days when the world was wide,
And the sky was bright and clear,
The rough rides, the storms, the pride,
And the glory of what we hold dear.

In the heart of the green vale,
Where the river runs free and wide,
Weâ€™ll sing of the tales we tell,
And the beauty of nature's side.

- AB Paterson Banjo Paterson
