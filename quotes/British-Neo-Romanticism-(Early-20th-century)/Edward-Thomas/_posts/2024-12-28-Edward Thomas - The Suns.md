The Sun's Eye

There the sun rests in the blue,
And we are drawn to wandering ways;
In the vastness, the quiet drew,
The essence of long summer days.

And in the sky where moments blend,
The stars still see us come and go;
They hold the laughter without end,
As time becomes a path we show.

For every ray that spills so bright
Behind the branches of the trees,
Is kissed with nature's gentle light,
In shades of joy upon the breeze.

- Edward Thomas
