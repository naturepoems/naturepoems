The Boy and the Birds

O the boy is an angel in the morning,  
In this blue expanse of sky  
Where the lark, as a lark can  
Perch near on the emerald ley  
And the birds sing happier now  
In myriad notes that break the dawn.  
Each flit and flutter captivates  
The youth, those simple wonders.  

Now the beauties with  
Feathered wings converge,  
Together, each birdling sings  
In nature's choir, 
Charming the tender heart awaiting,  
That blends a burst of grace  
In the joy of flight’s embrace  
To the sweet birds’ hymn,  
Each an echo of purity and fire.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
