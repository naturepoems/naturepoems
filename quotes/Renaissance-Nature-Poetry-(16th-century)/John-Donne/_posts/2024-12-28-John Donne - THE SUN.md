THE SUN RISING

Busy old fool, unruly Sun,
Why dost thou thus,
Through windows, and through curtains call on us?
Must to thy motions lovers' seasons run?
Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide
Late schoolboys and sour prentices,
Go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride,
Call country ants to harvest offices;
Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,
Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.

Thy beams so reverend and strong
Why shouldst thou think? I could eclipse them with a wink,
But that I would not lose her sight so long:
If her eyes have not blinded thine, look, and tomorrow shine.





So, where thou didst all, are find
In my mistressâ€™s eye; 
All power and measure brought to a deserved sigh: 
All thy powers, are no less than mine,
And all my powers of heart, departed thee;
None but thy self, need be own the Station I am;
You are my sunlight; I am destined,
If thou must go, you must stay,
I would not go, if I could resist your travel, or see
A sunny day without thee, 
To throw with thy face; 
And once free, just until then, 

And again to meet my sunlight every day, 
To let thee rise, and not once let me awake, 
And watch you at sunset, however grey.

So I shall bestow upon thee, Time begun,
And sleep well, you glorious, ruling Sun!

- John Donne
