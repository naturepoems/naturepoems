A Dream

I
  In a dim garden where the flowers gleam,
     An echo lingers murmuring low;
     The heart finds peace beneath the beam,
     A gentle lull of sweet repose.

II
  Under twilight's tender veil,
     Soft and fleeting, moments wane;
     My heart shall weave a bright white trail,
     Admired and cherished, pure refrain.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
