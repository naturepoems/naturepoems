To a Poor Old Woman

munching a plum on

the street

a thin

old

woman

with

a red

face

a

wrinkle

of

blue around
the mouth

and a taco

of

stale bread.

I

want to

be the

plum

inside your

sweet

red hands.

And we

can be

together

under the

pale

moonlight

once more.

- William Carlos Williams
