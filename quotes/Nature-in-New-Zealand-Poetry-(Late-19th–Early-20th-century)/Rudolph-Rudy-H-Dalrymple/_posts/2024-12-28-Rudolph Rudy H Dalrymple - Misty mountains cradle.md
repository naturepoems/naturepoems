Misty mountains cradle dreams,
Where rivers weave through valleys wide,
Their whispering streams tell timeless themes,
Of moments lost, of dreams that bide.

A sound of silence paints the scene,
With gentle light that breaks the dawn,
In nature’s arms, we find the serene,
A sacred space where we belong.


- Rudolph Rudy H Dalrymple
