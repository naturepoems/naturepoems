Soldati

         We are the nerve
         Center.  
         We are the earth.
         We belong to the sea.
         Full of explosions and dust,
         We die.  
         I think of the green,
         Leafy margins
         And the stars of bitter blooms.  
         
         
        
         


- Giuseppe Ungaretti
