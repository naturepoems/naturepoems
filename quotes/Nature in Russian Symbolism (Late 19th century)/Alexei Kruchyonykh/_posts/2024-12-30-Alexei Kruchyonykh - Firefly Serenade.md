Firefly Serenade
As dusk descends and the world turns dim,
Fireflies twinkle, a dance on a whim.
Nature’s own lanterns, lighting the night,
In their flickering ballet, the heart feels delight.

Each winking glow tells a story untold,
A journey of magic, both tender and bold.
In this serenade, where dreams intertwine,
I’ll follow their path, their spark to define.

- Alexei Kruchyonykh
