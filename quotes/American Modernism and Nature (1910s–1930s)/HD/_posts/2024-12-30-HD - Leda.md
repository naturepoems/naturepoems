Leda

  The wind is a crier
     of seas,
       he stirs his wings,
       through the wolves sky.
       Who is this—
   who cuts the thread,
       who catches night’s birds?
       And starlight is a twined chain,
      by fate. Let me be.
       I am sleep’s eternal nymph.
    
  O let men
  boast their strength;
   from me, as the heavens fall
  and stars flare,
   I will bloom from their tears,
     gathering beauty,
    like the petals, tomorrow’s heart.
   —H.D.
