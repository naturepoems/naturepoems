Fires of Autumn

The trees wear coats of flame,
each leaf’s descent a celebration,
crisp air carries the scent of decay,
a fragrant farewell to summer’s warmth.

Beneath, the earth sighs,
crunching underfoot,
whispers of seasons past,
while the horizon blushes,
with the embers of a cautious dusk.

Embrace the change, the cycle,
as fire feeds the ground,
it prepares for the rebirth
that lies beneath the frozen skin of winter,
each season a revolution,
a story written in the bark, the bones.
