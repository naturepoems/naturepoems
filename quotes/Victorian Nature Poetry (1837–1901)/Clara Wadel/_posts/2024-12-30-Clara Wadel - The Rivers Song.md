The River's Song

Beneath the bridges, waters flow,
With whispers soft and laughter bright,
Each current sings in ebb and glow,
A melody, both calm and light.

The stones beneath, a tale they tell,
Of journeys long and trials faced,
Through valleys deep and mountains swell,
The river’s heart will not be chased.

Each riverbank, a friend embraced,
In nature’s flow, we find our song,
For every bend, a dream is placed,
The river sings, we hum along.

- Clara Wadel
