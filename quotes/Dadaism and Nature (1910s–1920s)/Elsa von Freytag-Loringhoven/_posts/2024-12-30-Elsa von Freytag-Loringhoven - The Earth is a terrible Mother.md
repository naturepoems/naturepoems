The Earth is a terrible Mother,
   Relaxed hips of ivory
   Drift softly upon her
   Just one kiss and sunflowers knit
   O on her silk smock!

     //  
     The rose's softy lingering
   Was a bird strung from my soul.
   The divine, wild polyp!
   See it wiggle, see it dance.
   O Mother, unsheathe your dreams!
   Let the chickweed lull.
   O willow, hide him beneath your skirts!

- Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven
