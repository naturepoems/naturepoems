Petals on the Pavement
Scattered petals lie upon the pavement,
a quilt of color upon the grey
that nature throws with care,
a patchwork of life.

Each bloom is an explosion,
a rebellion against conformity;
they laugh, they sing,
as they adorn the mundane,
telling tales of fragrance and beauty,
illuminating the dark corners
where shadows try to creep.


- Francis Picabia
