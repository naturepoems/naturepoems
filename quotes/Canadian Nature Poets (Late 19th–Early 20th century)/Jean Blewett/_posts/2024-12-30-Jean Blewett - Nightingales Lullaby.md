The nightingale sings with a tender grace,
As silver stars begin to glow,
In hidden thickets, in secret place,
Where evening’s magic quietly grows.

Softly ruffling the sleepy air,
With melodies sweet, they serenade,
As I drift in dreams without a care,
Embraced by earth, in woodland's shade.

- Jean Blewett
