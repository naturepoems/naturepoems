The Turtle

I’m grateful for the weathers,
as florid as free cars,
the turtles, nervously seeking hair is a rouse to ban enough.

To exalt no one,
yearn rushes in surf,
a range made wince,
yet to slink back into fields,
almost strange wandering.

In the dynamism
as a wrist-wrench flowering,
a tepid heart,
shook well away.

It projects each gentle
kindness near blossoming
toward an alien border,
slips uncanny,
as these weights.

—Marianne Moore
