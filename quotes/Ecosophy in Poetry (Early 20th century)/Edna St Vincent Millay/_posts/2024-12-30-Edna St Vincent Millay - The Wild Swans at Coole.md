The Wild Swans at Coole  
  ---------------------------------------  
The trees are in their autumn beauty,  
  The woodland paths are dry,  
    Under the October twilight the water  
  Mirrors a still sky;  
    Upon the sloping bank I can see  
  The wild swans come and go.  
  I have looked upon those faces long and  
  I am not sorry for that.  

  I am thinking of the gift of beauty  
  And of the beauty of the swans.  
  I am thinking, as they pass,  
  Of the day of going away;  
  Of the day of coming to this bank  
  Again and again, with the swans.  

  The trees are in their autumn beauty,  
  And I am aware of beauty  
  As the leaves fall; but they will be there  
  Until the frost is on the trees,  
  Until the day turns to night,  
  And I shall remain,  
  And be granted more beauty from the swans.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
