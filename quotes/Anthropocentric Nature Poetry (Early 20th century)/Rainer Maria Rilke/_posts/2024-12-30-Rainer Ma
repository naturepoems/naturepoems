The Snow

Here the dayâ€™s quiet descends, its hand
caressing the sleeping and hushed earth,
as a soft choir of snowflakes begin
to drift and lace themselves to the ground.

In this serene silence, layers of white,
like all illusions, pull us together,
as the cold whispers comfort in deepening hushing,
while everything witnessed shies away.  

Yet through this calm, the heart awakens,
each flake becomes a thought, a fleeting inspiration,
each breath gathered among the distant trees,
till everything witnesses how quickly it yields.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
