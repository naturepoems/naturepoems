In the whispering woods, where glades spread wide,
Soft moss carpets the ground with a green embrace,
Sunlight dances in leaves, where shadows abide,
Nature’s quiet secrets find their rightful place.

A brook hums a tune, in harmony it flows,
While wildflowers nod with a delicate grace,
The world awakens as each moment grows,
Life pulses softly in this sacred space.

- Andrejs Panteļeevs
