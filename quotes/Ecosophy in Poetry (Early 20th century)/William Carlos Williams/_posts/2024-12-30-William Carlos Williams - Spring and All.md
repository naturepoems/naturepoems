Spring and All

By the road to

the contagious hospital

under the surge of the

blizzard

a crowd of the

truly anonymous

quietly assembles

I can see them all:

the homeless doors
with their open

noses or the boards

of mere physical.

We stand together,

at the passing

and there is a place

in memory

to drive into

with great care

you may lie down

in the dark and

bright snow.

- William Carlos Williams
