Rain cascades,  
          fragments of laughter falling,
    art of moisture on canvas unseen.
   Each droplet tells a story of mortar and ivy,
   entwined in nature—
          tinkling,  
   refreshing the world’s weary sigh.
     Taste the earth’s unyielding pulse,  
             feel it awaken.
