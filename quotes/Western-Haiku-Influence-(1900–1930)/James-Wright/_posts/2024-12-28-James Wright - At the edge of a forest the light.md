quote: "At the edge of a forest, the light breaks through, 
A world dips into colors unseen— 
Each blade of grass recounts a story, 
As the water tastes the sky’s soft tears, 
Nature’s cadence sings through the soul."

At the edge of a forest, the light breaks through, 
A world dips into colors unseen— 
Each blade of grass recounts a story, 
As the water tastes the sky’s soft tears, 
Nature’s cadence sings through the soul.
