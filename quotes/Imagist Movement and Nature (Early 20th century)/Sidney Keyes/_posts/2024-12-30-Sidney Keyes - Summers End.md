Summer's End

As summer winds unfurl with the mist,
Engulfing the warmth, the shadows sulk;
Yet they play, the dew-covered grasses
With lingering touches of nightâ€”
Emboldened to fade by the golden sun,
Innocence fumbles with what remains;
For here we embrace their timorous pulses,
The sighing trees crafted from glaze,
No grasp for the chill yet dressed by the hour,
A moment caught before it begins to flee,
So while the soft earth hums with the breath,
Breathe deep, sustain; every moment follows on.
