The Forest  
   
In shaded groves, where secrets hide,  
The whispers thread through every leaf,  
In tangled roots, where dreams collide,  
The forest holds our joys and grief.  
  
With towering trees, a canopy,  
That dances with the winds of time,  
In natureâ€™s arms, wild and free,  
We find our breath, our dreams, our rhyme.  
  
O forest deep, a sacred place,  
In every rustle, life does dwell,  
Your beauty sings, a warm embrace,  
A tale of peace that weaves its spell.

- Herman Melville
