The quiet brook sings soft and low,
In harmony with rustling leaves,
With nature's pulse, a gentle flow,
Each note a gift that it retrieves.

Through meadows where the wildflowers grow,
In every breeze, the world does weave,
A tapestry of joy and woe,
In natureâ€™s arms, we dare believe.

- Gerhard Gran
