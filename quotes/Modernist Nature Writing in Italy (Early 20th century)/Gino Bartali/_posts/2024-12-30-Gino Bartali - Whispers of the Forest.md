The forest breathes,  
a gentle sigh,  
wrapped in shadows,  
a sanctuary for the soul.  
Here, whispers of the past  
linger in the air,  
aromatic memories  
of pine and earth,  
interwoven in the silence.  

Birds flit through  
the dappled light,  
a ballet in flight,  
while beneath, the ferns  
stand guard,  
their fronds unfurling  
in a delicate dance.

- Gino Bartali
