Under the Moonlight

Silver beams cascade,
On the dewy ground,
Enveloping the night,
In a silence profound.

The stars peek through clouds,
In a cosmic embrace,
Nature holds her breath,
In this tranquil place.

Oh night, sweet night,
Wrapped in dreams so bright,
You cradle the earth,
In your soft, glowing light.

- John Thompson
