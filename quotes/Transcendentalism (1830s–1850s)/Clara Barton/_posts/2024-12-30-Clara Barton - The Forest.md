The Forest

Within the woods, the shadows dance,
To the symphony of the breeze;
Where nature spins its web of chance,
And every leaf a story weaves.

The whispering trees, the rustling leaves,
Invite the heart to ponder deep,
In silent moments, the spirit receives,
The ancient truth that lives to keep.

- Clara Barton
