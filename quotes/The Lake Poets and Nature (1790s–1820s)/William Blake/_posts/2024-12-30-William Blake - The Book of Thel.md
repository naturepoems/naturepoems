The Book of Thel  
O Thou who passest thro' our vallies in  
Thy Chariot of the Sun!  
Crowned with the glow of light,  
Thou who dost own infinite delight.  
  
As I thy path pursue,  
All heaven truth, I see in You!  
The sun, my love's paw,  
The golden flower, the wintry dew.  
  
O life alive!  
In darkness the mainstream flows;  
All things cower!  
Little cherub in bow!  
O Thou who passest thro' our vallies in  
Your adamantine bright!  

**William Blake**
