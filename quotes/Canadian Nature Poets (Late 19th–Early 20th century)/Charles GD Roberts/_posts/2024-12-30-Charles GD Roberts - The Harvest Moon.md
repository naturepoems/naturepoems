The Harvest Moon

A night of wonder, rich and bright,  
  The harvest moon ascends,  
With silver beams that paint the fields,  
  And golden beauty sends.  
The stalks sway gently in the breeze,  
  Like statues cast in light,  
And nature rests with bated breath  
  Beneath her gentle sight.

O muse of harvest, gift divine,  
  That crowns the toil of days,  
With shadows deep in the golden sheaves,  
  And hides among the rays;  
Here stands the miracle of life,  
  In every grain and fruit,  
Where whispering labor speaks of love,  
  The tender and the brute.

As evening falls, the birds take flight,  
  Surrendering edges clear,  
The silence wraps the world in peace,  
  And the heart swells full of cheer.  
So let me breathe this nighttime air,  
  And drink the liquid glow,  
For beauty crowns the harvest moon  
  In a realm where dreamers go.

- Charles GD Roberts
