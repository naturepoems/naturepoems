Where are those times that gloamed our eyes,  
While a star did color the skies?  
In the stillness, the moon alight,  
Our hearts were joined in pure delight.  
Let me find in every tree  
The face of memory—me and thee.  
This bloom of petals soft and rare,  
Shall be the breath of times we share.

The softest glow of dusk shall bring,  
In dreams of love, the woodland sing,  
With the harmony life’s grace  
In each note the heart would trace!

- Sir Philip Sidney
