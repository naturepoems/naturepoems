To me, the undisturbed, the ocean's breath
Is far more sad than silence; the last sigh
Is like the murmuring of our depths'
Thou who canst hear me, O, call me not die!
Silence, full of majesty and truth,
O, waste no whispers here;"        
How long my fondest little heart has beat,
And echoes of answers will seek my dreams!


- George Gordon Lord Byron
