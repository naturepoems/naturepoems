Upon the Highlands

Upon the highlands wild and free,
I find my spirit’s harmony,
The winds that dance amongst the trees,
Bring whispers of the mountain’s pleas.

Each stone and brook, a tale untold,
The silver mist like threads of gold,
With nature’s solace by my side,
I walk with pride, let fear subside.

The rugged peaks, they reach for stars,
In quiet grace, they speak from afar,
And in their shadow, I will stand,
A humble heart upon the land.

- John Muir
