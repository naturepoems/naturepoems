The starry night, a canopy of dreams,
Whispers secrets upon the sleeping earth;
Each twinkling light, a silent prayer,
Overflowing with the weight of wonder.

Mountains rise, ancient and wise,
Guardians of time, watchful and still;
In the valley below, rivers flow,
A dance of life, a tranquil thrill.

Listen, can you hear the nightingale?
Her melody, a balm for weary souls;
In the vast embrace of natureâ€™s arms,
Each note tells a tale of eternity whole.

- Arthur Rimbaud
