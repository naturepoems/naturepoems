To see a World in a Grain of Sand
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,
And Eternity in an hour.

A Robin Redbreast in a Cage
Puts all Heaven in a Rage.
A dove house filled with doves and pigeons
Shudders Heaven with the terror of prisoners.

A soul in the body, singing to the Void,
While the Earth trembles with the sound.
Let a man live, let a man die,
And with the seed of his body grow sound.


- William Blake
