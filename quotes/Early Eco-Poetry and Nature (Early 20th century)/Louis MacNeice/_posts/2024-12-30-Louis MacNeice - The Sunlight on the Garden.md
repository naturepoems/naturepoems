The Sunlight on the Garden

The sunlight on the garden lies
Like a tassel on a book, a breath of nature’s sighs,
As golden warmth spills through a stretch of golden daffodils,
And afternoons bloom bright with earth's own frills.

The winds of change rustle through the leaves,
Murmurs of beauty that the heart believes,
In every blade of grass beneath our toes,
In every petal that from creation flows.

Let this moment linger in our hearts,
As swirling colors dance and never part;
The garden whispers secrets, ancient, bold,
And in its glow, a tapestry unfolds.
—Louis MacNeice
