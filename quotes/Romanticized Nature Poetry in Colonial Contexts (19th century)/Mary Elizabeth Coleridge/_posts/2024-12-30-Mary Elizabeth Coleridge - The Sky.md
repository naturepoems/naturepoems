The Sky

O endless sky of azure blue,
A canvas bright where dreams take flight,
In you the stars find space so true,
To paint their hopes in gentle night.

Your clouds, like whispers, drift and sway,
With every hue, a tale of peace,
You cradle night; you greet the day,
A symphony that will not cease.

In every storm and windâ€™s embrace,
You remind us of the vast unknown,
And in your arms, we find our place,
Beneath your vastness, we have grown.


- Mary Elizabeth Coleridge
