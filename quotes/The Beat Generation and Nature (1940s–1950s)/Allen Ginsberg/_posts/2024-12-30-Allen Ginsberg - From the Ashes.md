From the Ashes

After all the violence, the dust settles,
How quiet is the evening air,
The trees become still,
   the sky, a canvas of gold,
Apart from sadness, there emerges the beauty,
        emerging from the ashes,
Where hearts once broke,
   now flows the healing light,
Nature, calling our spirits home once more.
