The hills that rise against the skies,
With majesty, so proud and high,
Do cradle all that life implies,
While time and seasons pass us by.

In every stone, a story's found,
In every shadow, peace resides;
The gentle stream with babbling sound,
A lullaby that never hides.

Let harmony guide each step to take,
Along the paths where nature leads;
For in her arms, our hearts awake,
And from her bosom, kindness feeds.

- Hannah More
