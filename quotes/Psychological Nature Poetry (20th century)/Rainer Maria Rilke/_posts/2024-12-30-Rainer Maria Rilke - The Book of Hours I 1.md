The Book of Hours I, 1

I live my life in widening circles
That reach out across the world.
I may not complete this last one
But I give myself to it.

I circle around God, around the ancient tower,
And I’ve been circling for thousands of years.
And I still don’t know: am I a stranger, 
Or am I returning home?

I circle around the sacred tower,
The tower of my heart,
And the roundness of my life.
I am surrounded, yet so alone.

With every turning, the spiral tightens.
And I can see the moon get larger,
And the clouds fall softly, 
While wildflowers bloom in the distance.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
