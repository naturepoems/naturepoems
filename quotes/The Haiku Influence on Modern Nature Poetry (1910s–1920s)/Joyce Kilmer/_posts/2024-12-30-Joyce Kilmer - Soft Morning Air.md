Soft is the morning air that sighs  
Through meadows all ablaze;  
The songs of feathered friends arise  
To greet the summer days.  

The rivers glide and forests sway,  
And softly, dew-kissed flowers;  
The warmth of sun, the breeze at play,  
Awake nature’s sweet hours.  

In simple joys, my spirit’s free,  
To float upon the breeze;  
The beauty wild of land and sea,  
Can offer sweet release.

- Joyce Kilmer
