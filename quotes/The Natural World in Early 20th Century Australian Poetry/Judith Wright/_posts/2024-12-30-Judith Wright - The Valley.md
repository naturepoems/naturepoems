The Valley

The valley sleeps, a cradle of earth,
Rock descends to the calm of stream,
And the trees lean low,
Whispering old words, in the hush of morn.

On the quiet shores of the river,
Nature breathes a moment of grace,
And the heart of the valley holds,
The pulse of the flowing years.


- Judith Wright
