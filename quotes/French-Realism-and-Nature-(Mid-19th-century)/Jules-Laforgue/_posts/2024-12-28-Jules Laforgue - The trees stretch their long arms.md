The trees stretch their long arms,  
Indifferent to the passing hours,  
Swaddled in the green cloak of time.  
Among the burbling brook and whispers,  
Each leaf unfurls its dreams,  
A soft ballet of nature’s peace.  
Oh, what sweetness drips from the sun,  
Tender and cool, like the kiss of rain.  
It isn’t brightness without shadow,  
Nor is it silence without song,  
In nature, all is balanced and pure.

- Jules Laforgue
