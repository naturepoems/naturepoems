quote: "Summer’s End  
As summer dances its last ballet,  
The fields wear the hues of wildfire,  
And echoes of laughter linger,  
In the soft cooling air, they tire."

Summer’s End  
As summer dances its last ballet,  
The fields wear the hues of wildfire,  
And echoes of laughter linger,  
In the soft cooling air, they tire.
