A Song of the Night

With the dark setting close, a new magic descends,
The moon floods the world with the light that it lends;
And the starlight glistens on each dew-tipped leaf,
Reflecting the dreams of the evening in brief.

The shadows stretch long as the silence surrounds,
In the heart of the forest, where mystery bounds;
O, what secrets lie hidden, with whispers so brave,
In the hush of the night where the wild creatures wave.

With nature in slumber, against the cool breeze,
I tread lightly onward, my spirit at ease,
For the night speaks in beauty as dreams take their flight,
In the softest embrace of a magical night.

Among the soft shadows where the crickets keep tune,
And the world opens wide to the kiss of the moon;
A rest from the chaos, a sweet lullaby,
In Nature’s own cradle, beneath the dark sky.
