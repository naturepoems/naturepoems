In the heat of the sun,
The acacia spreads her arms wide,
Casting long shadows on the ground.
Her leaves dance with the breeze,
Whispering secrets of the ancients.

Beneath her boughs, stories unfold,
Of children playing, of lovers’ vows,
Of the life that thrums in the soil,
Deep in the heart, our pride and hope.


- Julius Nyerere
