Fields of lavender awaken,
Perfumed with the breath of spring,
Each blossom tells a story,
Of love, of loss, of everything.

I kneel to the earth,
My fingers brushing petals soft,
In the whispers of the flowers,
I hear the voice of forgotten dreams.

Underneath a sapphire sky,
The sun kisses tenderly,
Illuminating the hope that grows,
Rooted in the soil of tomorrow,
Daring to reach for the light,
Against the winds of uncertainty.

Here, amongst the blooms,
Life speaks its vibrant truth,
In every shade, in every scent,
A reminder, a promiseâ€”
To bloom where we are planted.

- Ettore Cozzani
