I am the sea"

quote: "The sea is a part of me
I am the sea; everything is bigger.
A wave is coming on a wave, and the echo
Of each wave dissolves into ornament.
Wind carries day across a smooth surface,
Perpetuates a pattern that weighs nothing.

As water recedes it unearths light,
How far does it carry the unformed,
What can expand beyond the spiraling drift,
The dust of the current where no horizon stays?"

The sea is a part of me
I am the sea; everything is bigger.
A wave is coming on a wave, and the echo
Of each wave dissolves into ornament.
Wind carries day across a smooth surface,
Perpetuates a pattern that weighs nothing.

As water recedes it unearths light,
How far does it carry the unformed,
What can expand beyond the spiraling drift,
The dust of the current where no horizon stays?
