The Echoing Hills  
The hills stand tall, their silence grand,  
While echoes grace the gentle vale,  
In whispers soft, by nature’s hand,  
They share their ancient, tender tale.

Each stone, a monument of time,  
In moss and fern, their secrets old,  
Unveiling breath, in sacred rhyme,  
In valley’s heart, they dare unfold.

The sunrise spills its golden hue,  
A kiss upon the mountain’s crest,  
With every glance, a world anew,  
In nature’s arms, the spirit’s rest.

So let me wander in these bounds,  
To hear the echoes strong and clear,  
In nature’s mirth, my heart resounds,  
And finds a place where dreams adhere.

- Richard Crashaw
