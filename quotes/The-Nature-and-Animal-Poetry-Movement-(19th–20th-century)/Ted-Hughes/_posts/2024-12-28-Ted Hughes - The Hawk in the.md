The Hawk in the Rain

    I

    It was a hawk that shattered in the rain.
    I still see it, streaked across the grey sky,  
    Thunderous in its serrated desolation.
    Blood-red thighs, wings that slipped on the wind
    Are my constant thoughts.

    II

    From its hungry cries the clouds boiled above
    All day and into the night, like some enormous beast,
    Until the very air was full of its feathers.
    I watched it hunting, dipping and diving,
    Swooping down, through the roaring darkness.

    III

    Yet, in that storm, I knew that pain’s beauty
    Was the trunk of its death-shape and widening wings:
    The haunting memory of its fall, where nothing was alive,
    Just the dried brambles of its hunger, its darting, dying pulse.

    IV

    It shook the stars awake and finally came down,
    A slender body arching toward me,
    This hawk becoming shadow in the rain  
    Sinking into nightmares, still wild and proud.
    And it was loved, so loved I could only weep.
