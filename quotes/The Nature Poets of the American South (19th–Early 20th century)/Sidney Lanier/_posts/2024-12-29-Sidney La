The Dawn

Awakening into morning’s light,  
Where soft tendrils of time ignite;  
A symphony on breath of air,  
Shadows flee, the world laid bare.

O gentle dawn, with hues so sweet,  
The sky now spreads, where ocean meets;  
Each moment offered in soft embrace,  
To the heart of nature’s grace.

Where every color reaches high,  
In bated breath, as dreams draw nigh;  
Each answer swells in a world so true,  
As twilight fades to a golden hue.


- Sidney Lanier
