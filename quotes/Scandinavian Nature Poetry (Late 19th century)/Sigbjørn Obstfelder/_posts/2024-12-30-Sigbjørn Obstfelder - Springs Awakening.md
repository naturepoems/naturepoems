In the spring’s tender blush, life stirs anew,
With blossoms awakening, green shoots arise;
The earth, once silent, now bursts into song,
And the chorus of life reaches high to the skies.

Buds open wide, as hope blooms in hearts,
Each color a promise, each fragrance a dream;
In this season of growth, my spirit takes flight,
With nature as my guide, I follow the stream.

- Sigbjørn Obstfelder
