Winter's Breath

Oh quiet, pure, unfurling snow,
   That casts a blanket soft upon the land,
Your whispered hush is all we know,
   In this still moment, here we stand.

The trees are wrapped in garments white,
   Their limbs adorned in frozen lace,
And in the glow of pale moonlight,
   The world dissolves, we find our place.

In winter's breath, there is a song,
   A harmony of silence, deep and true,
Where time stands still, and all belongs,
   In the heart of nature, ever new.

- AJM Smith
