The sun slips low beyond the hill,
As twilight spreads its cloak of peace.
The softest winds begin to still,
In nature’s warmth, all sorrows cease.

Each bloom, a story wrapped in light,
Each scent, a memory unheard.
As day succumbs to coming night,
In every heart, a song’s deferred.


- Rupert Brooke
