Some Questions

What is it you plan to do  
     with your one wild and precious life?  
     What if we breathe in the beauty  
     that surrounds us  
     and let every moment be a prayer?  
     What if we listen  
     in the stillness,  
     to the heart of the earth,  
     and feel our pulse  
     in the rivers and the trees?  
     Can we embrace the wildness  
     that lives in us?

- Mary Oliver
