In the Northern Near-Sight

In the North it rains, clouds drop,
A wind, so old and fusty,
And streams that water the roots
Gather thrice memory and gone.

Leaves by the river fall down,
Leaves of autumn that weave,
Found along the silky green;
There rest—against the bank,
Matter shaken and wide.

That birth of renewal casts far,
Crafts without condition, wind—
In nothing but hours libertine;
And gather in the eyeful.
                                 


- Wallace Stevens
