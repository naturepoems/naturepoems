To the River

Thou wondrous, wondrous river! 
That in thy strength dost roll, 
Oh, might I live beside thee,  
And love thee, as I soul!  

Thou art a life-giving stream,  
And me thou dost sustain,  
Thou art the glorious emblem  
Of nature’s beauty’s reign.  

Oft have I wandered by thee  
And watched thy waters flow,  
With a pride in thy majestic sweep,  
As thy billows toss and glow.

I have reflected in thy depths, 
The skies so blue and bright,  
And oft have questioned of the stars,  
That glittered in the night.  

Oh, could I but be with thee,  
I’d give my heart away,  
And with thee share my spirit’s bliss
On such a summer’s day.

- Lydia Sigourney
