Ebbing Tides  
The ocean’s roll, the ebbing tide,  
A dance of nature, wild and wide;  
The waves embrace the sandy shore,  
And whisper secrets evermore.  

With every crash, a story told,  
Of journeys long, of treasures bold;  
In each retreat, a promise kept,  
Of life renewed as daylight crept.  

**- HF Hugh C Miller**
