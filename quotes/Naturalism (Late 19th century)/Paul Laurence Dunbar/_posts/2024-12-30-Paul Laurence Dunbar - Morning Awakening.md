The morning dew on blades of grass  
Awakens life as moments pass.  
The sun ascends, a fireball bright,  
That banishes the bonds of night.  

Each creature stirs and stretches slow,  
In nature's arms, the world will grow.  
As day breaks forth, so too our dreams,  
In radiant light, all really seems.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
