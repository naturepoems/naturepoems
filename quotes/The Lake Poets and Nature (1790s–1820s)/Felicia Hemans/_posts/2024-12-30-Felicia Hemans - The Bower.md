The Bower

In the glade of a woodland fair,
Where the light winds whisper low,
There lies a bower, a refuge rare,
That Nature and peace bestow.

With flowers that climb in the gentle sun,
And vines that twine on high,
A sanctuary where hearts are won,
And time still drifts and sighs.

A seat of moss where silence reigns,
Where laughter of leaf is heard;
It is here amid the quiet lanes,
By the songs of the sweet birds stirred.

Let us whisper our dreams in this sacred place,
In the bower, our moments dwell;
With hearts entwined in love and grace,
We forge our hopes and bid farewell.

—Felicia Hemans
