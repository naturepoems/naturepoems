Where the wildflowers paint the fields,  
Under the warmth of the golden sun,  
A tapestry of life, beauty yields,  
In nature's heart, all things are one.

The laughter of children in soft grass lies,  
As bees hum gently, the world at play,  
In nature's hands, joy never dies,  
A living dream in each bright day.


- Yves Tanguy
