Winds of Change
Whispering winds, a soft caress,
Nature speaks, no need to guess.
Change is coming, feel the shift,
A promise wrapped in nature's gift.

Leaves will dance to the new refrain,
In this cycle, loss and gain,
With every gust, we learn to bend,
Embracing journey to the end.


- Antonio SantElia
