In the shadow of the willow, I reside,  
Where the brookâ€™s laughter mingles with echoes,  
Each ripple a flirtation with time's essence,  
The birds weave melodies that twine in the air,  
In the great canvas of twinkling leaves.  
How tranquil it is, to watch the world dance,  
Beneath the watchful gaze of the sky,  
And in this moment, I am but a whisper,  
A breath that stirs the stories of solitude.

- Jules Laforgue
