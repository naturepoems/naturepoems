Under the arch of the ancient oaks,
Where history weaves with time's slow thread,
Each ring a chapter, each leaf a verse,
In the library of nature, stories spread.

Swirling winds bring tales from afar,
Of distant lands and the lives they nurture,
In the rustling whispers, a promise prevails,
That we are all part of this grand adventure.

- Gustave Flaubert
