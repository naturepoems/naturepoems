Haunted  
  --------  
I am haunted by the hail and ice,  
  The snow is kneeling in the night,  
But the morning is bright and full of  
  The air, the bright light,  
To still the memories of winter,  
  And I am alive in this new day.  

The roots, deep in the frost,  
  Await the sun, to take their chance,  
And I too, deep in thought,  
  Wait to dance  
For the gaining warmth of back,  
  I shall not forget the trees.  


- Edna St Vincent Millay
