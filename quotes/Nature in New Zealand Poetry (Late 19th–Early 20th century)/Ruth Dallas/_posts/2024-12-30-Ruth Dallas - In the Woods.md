Among the groves where the wild things dwell,  
I wander lightly on earth's great breast;  
In the whispering woods, I hear the spell  
Of nature's secrets, as I find my rest.  

The owls hoot low, the crickets sing,  
While the moon drapes silver on leaf and thorn;  
In this tranquility, my heart takes wing,  
As I am reborn in the hush of morn.

- Ruth Dallas
