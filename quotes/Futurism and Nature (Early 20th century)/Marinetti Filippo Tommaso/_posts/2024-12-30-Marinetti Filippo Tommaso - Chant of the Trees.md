Chant of the Trees
Arise, stillness,  —noble trees!  
Your breaths mark the golden hour,
you dig into the heart of many things,  
roots betraying their timelessness.

Otters and echoes fill your bark.  
You wrap your adapters,  
making songs with the rattle of air,  
your limbs and bark are melodies sung!  

Oh forest, bear witness  
to the exultation of your song,  
as I raise a hymn to your secrets,  
for in your shadows, life ignites!

Nature’s heart, a drum  
of verdant fervor  
in each layer’s embrace!

- Marinetti Filippo Tommaso
