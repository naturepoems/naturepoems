A serpent glittering on the lawn,
   In sea green hues and frosted light;
   Hope that sighs in the dawn,
   And melts away in sight,
   To where the shining falls are drawn.

O echo of thy love!
   Where bloom the fairest flowers,
   A flickering breath and fleeting sigh
   Are hope and burning hours;
   What difference life could prove?

My love is swift as summer air,
   And bright as brilliant rise from lager,
   I watch and wait with humble care,
   And cast my hawk to find the wagger!

O echo of thy love!
   That life so rarely grieves,
   O caress of evening glow,
   And bloom of fairest leaves!

- Christina Rossetti
