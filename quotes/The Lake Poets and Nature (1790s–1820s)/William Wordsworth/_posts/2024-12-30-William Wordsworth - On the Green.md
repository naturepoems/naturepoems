I love this passage of the green,
Where whispers watch like timid fairies dine,
The silence grows more and more serene,
Within these thoughtful woods, I find.  

Across the labyrinth of stone,
The river murmurs its sweet refrain,
And ancient oaks have built them a throne,
Within these shrouded paths of rain.

The fluttering leaf, a passing glance,
A rush unlike the winter’s cold,
The garden shakes like a merry dance,
While blooms unfold, a sight to behold.

- William Wordsworth
