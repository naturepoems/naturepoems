The Scriptures of Nature

In the green lawn veined with gold,
  There sings a tale untold,
Let the quivering leaf become
  A whisper in the gloam.

We walk into shadow and sun,
  Where echoing secrets come,
And each sound in gentle stir,
  The voice of nature’s purr.

To the heart willing to see,
  And to the eye so bold,
The broken lights of classes long, 
  Revel tales of old.

So let us embrace nature and its grace,
  Pick its ripe fruits as they rise,
For in each blossom’s embrace, 
  There resides the wise.

- James Russell Lowell
