Mauvais Sang

With the gales of the deep, I stir within,
Figured landscapes; perfumed, I flow like wine;
With darting scents, a splendid lyre din,
Lifts my passions through trees, twine divine!

All mysteries wrap their dust, I hear sing;
Resounding echoes brush past velvet skies;
I land on whispers, fond with frantic wing,
To witness the wonders that twilight supplies.

Flower the shadowed path, the wild embark,
With slow lace twirling through the nightâ€™s soft grace;
The pulsing of the wild winds' sacred spark
Feeds my heart, entices the lost space!

- Arthur Rimbaud
