The sun is a golden ball
as it dips into the dark—
I see it without shutters or curtains,
just hanging there above the trees.

The clouds fray out like lace,
a soft blush in the evening air,
which whispers stories of the day
out of the cooler night skies.

I imagine the stars
finding their paths through the dark,
lit by the secret dreams
of the new born dusk,  
where shadows roam and life begins.

- Sara Teasdale
