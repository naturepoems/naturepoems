The Sound of Trees
I wonder about the trees.
Why do we wish to bear
Forever on our own?

What are trees to you?
Were there with hurricanes,
Swirling in the glassy air?

This is a sound of trees,
That makes me wonder why.
Why do I think I have seen
The sound of trees outside?

It’s a sound of trees
That makes me hear so deluged,
Why do the trees keep calling me?

What do trees say,
If they saw deep melancholy?
Is it winds that call to them?

Such a comfort-hand would be,
Without a point I could see.
Reflecting from above it, as in me.

- Robert Frost
