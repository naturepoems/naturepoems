About Trees

I cannot talk with trees;  
There are other things that sing  
And only near the hollow trunk  
Of that murmuring orange tree.  
Leaves that cover its limbs with their sheen  
And shine with each passing breeze  
Make whispers own way to things unseen.

I cannot sit beneath a bough,  
For I am never still  
And for all their glow and green;  
They are too calm yet still.  
I walk instead in battle fights  
Through storms that take me high,  
But I am born for endless flight  
And have no will to die.

- Edward Thomas
