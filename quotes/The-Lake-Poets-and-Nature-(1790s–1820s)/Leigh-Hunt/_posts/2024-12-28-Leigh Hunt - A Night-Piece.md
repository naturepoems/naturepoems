A Night-Piece  
When the pale moon, on her solitary way,  
With silver light doth flood the gloomy earth,  
The poet sighs; for thoughts of peace and worth,  
Have flown upon that stream a soft decay.  
Yet in the twilight hours, a fragrant gale,  
Lifts with its pinions the soul’s light and pain,  
And blends the quiet with a surge of gain,  
For God is with us in the night if we do not fail.  
And Nature speaks; we, too, can woo the strains,  
Unfold the book of life, and breathe her love  
Into our hearts, as we behold her dove  
Returning through the inscrutable refrains.

- Leigh Hunt
