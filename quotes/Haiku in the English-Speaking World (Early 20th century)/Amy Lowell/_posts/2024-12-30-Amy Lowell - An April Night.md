An April Night

There are lambs in the meadow  
And soft skies above themâ€”  
A whirl of cloud drift by with a sigh  
In the  warm breezes of April.

The violets nestle in wet grass,  
Their tiny heads nodding strong  
For the welcome of Spring!  
The sun again may rise with the day,  
But here is twilight, glowing soft.

- Amy Lowell
