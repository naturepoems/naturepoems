In the Garden

In the garden, blooms delight,
Where roses blush in morning's light;
The scents entwine, a fragrant race,
In nature's arms, I find my place.

The daisies nod their heads to time,
And birds in chorus softly chime;
Each petal tells a story sweet,
Of life renewed at summer's feet.

O little garden, breathe anew,
With every gust of warm spring's dew;
For in thy heart, the world we save,
And find our solace by the wave.

- Thomas Woolner
