A Dream Deferred
What happens to a dream deferred?
Does it dry up
  like a raisin in the sun?
Or fester like a sore--
  And then run?
Does it stink like rotten meat?
Or crust and sugar over--
  like a syrupy sweet?
Maybe it just sags
  like a heavy load.
Or does it explode?

A dream deferred,
  A dream torn from nature's hand.

- Langston Hughes
