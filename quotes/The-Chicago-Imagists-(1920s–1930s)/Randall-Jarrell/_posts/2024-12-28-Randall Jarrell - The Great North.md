The Great North Road
    The nightwind, with its stroke of wind,
    Caught you. Tuning, the rain's thin thread.
    Armfuls of forest, in black oil, bend
    Over the night, all evaporated.

    The sky's one stiff and savage blue,
    To the seed of stars, rewarding strode,
    Until dusk. Hand to the moon, new
    The landscape's heavy epilogue  
    Came on. They were ready, lasted, far.

- Randall Jarrell
