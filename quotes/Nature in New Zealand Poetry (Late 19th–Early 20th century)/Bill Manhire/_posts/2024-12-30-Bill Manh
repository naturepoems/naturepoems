The Edge
I walked to the edge  
of the world, where  
each breath held meaning,  
a union of land and sea.

The sky unfolded above me,  
waving a feather of cloud;  
the sun dipped on the horizon,  
painting the waves with gold.

And here at this threshold,  
I find my soul dancing  
with the shadows,  
where everything becomes one,  
a story that carries  
the echo of eternity.

- Bill Manhire
