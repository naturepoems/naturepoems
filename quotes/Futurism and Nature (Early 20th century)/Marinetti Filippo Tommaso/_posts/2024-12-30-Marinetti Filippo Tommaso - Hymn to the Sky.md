Hymn to the Sky
Great azure,  
an endless battle lost  
in layers of mirror and lightning!  

Your screaming splendor  
takes me up  
into your dumb purity.  

Lo! your colors flood my heart,  
wherein past and future clash,  
where my dreams are your horizon.  

Sky! embracing winds  
filling your lungs, my cosmos  
is a grateful lover,  
while centuries write slowly!

- Marinetti Filippo Tommaso
