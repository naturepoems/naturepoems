There’s a certain Slant of light,  
Winter Afternoons –  
That oppresses, like the Heft  
Of Cathedral Tunes –  

Heavenly Hurt, it gives us –  
We can find no scar,  
But internal difference,  
Where the Meanings, are –  

None may teach it – Any –  
‘Tis the Seal of that,  
The only Genius to allow  
A shiver of content –  

"There’s a certain Slant of light"

- Emily Dickinson
