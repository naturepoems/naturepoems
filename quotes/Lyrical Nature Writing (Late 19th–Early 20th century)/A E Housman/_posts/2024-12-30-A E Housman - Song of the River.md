SONG OF THE RIVER

Murming waters softly flow,  
By moonlit banks so still and low;  
Wrap me in your calm embrace,  
O river known in nature’s grace.

For every droplet tells a tale  
Of whispers lost in breezes frail;  
And in your depths, reflections shine,  
Of dreams that dance, forever mine.  


- A E Housman
