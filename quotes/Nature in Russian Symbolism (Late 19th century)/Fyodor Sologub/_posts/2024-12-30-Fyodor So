In the embrace of tall, whispering pines,  
A world of solace awaits the bold,  
Where nature’s verses, pure and divine,  
In silences broken, new stories unfold.  

The rustle of leaves—a soft chiaroscuro,  
In shadows deep, the light breaks through,  
Guiding the lost, like a gentle hero,  
To find the beauty in life's tapestry true.

- Fyodor Sologub
