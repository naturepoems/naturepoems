Summer Night

Summer night presses close  
  the garden blooms,  
  The twilight is a sound  
 
Of all these soft, low things,  
  While cicada soar and praise  
  the warm scent  
 
rising up with the light;  
  Between profusing vases  
  lies all that is alive.  
 
And wonder dreams awake,  
  where dreams don’t miss a beat  
  with their currents lapping near.  

—Lola Ridge
