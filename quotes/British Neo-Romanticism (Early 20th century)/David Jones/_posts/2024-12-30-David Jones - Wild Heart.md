O, wild heart of the earth, in your vibrant thrall,
Where mountains embrace and the rivers fall,
The sun in your arms with a laugh and a sigh,
Paints gold on the horizon, and gives wings to the sky.

Your valleys are murmurs, your peaks are a song,
In the arms of your nature, I, a traveler, belong.

- David Jones
