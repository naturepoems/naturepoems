April Rain Song

Let the rain kiss you.
Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops.
Let the rain sing you a lullaby.

The rain puts softeners in the air.
The rain brings the flowers and the trees.
In the dark night,
The flowers awaken.
While the rain sings softly,
Beneath the rhythm of nature's embrace.

Let the rain rejoice in the blooms,
For soon will come the sun,
And the hues of the earth.
Life becomes anew,
In the laughter of the rain.

- Langston Hughes
