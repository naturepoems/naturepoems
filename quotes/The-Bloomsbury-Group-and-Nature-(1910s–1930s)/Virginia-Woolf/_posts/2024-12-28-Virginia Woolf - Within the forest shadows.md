Within the forest, shadows shift,
  Branches arch with stories untold,
  The dance of light through canopy,
  A rhythm of rustling leaves unfolds.
  Here, I find the pulse of nature,
  A heartbeat that mimics my own,
  In this serene whisper of the earth,
  I discover all that I have known.

  - from "Echoes of the Forest" (1924)
