The Song of the Night

Night, still, and yet full of life,
    it is whole, full of warmth.
    Stars are breaking out of the darkness,
    speaking of love,
    all songs are hushed in the vastness.

    The moonlike night seems endless,
    a sweet burden larger than ourselves,
    still expanding, still glowing,
    and with it, I am beautifully lost.

—Rainer Maria Rilke
