Through winter’s chill and crisp white grace,
The world dons a soft, silent face,
The stars shine bright, like diamonds tossed,
In the hush of night, I am not lost.

Each flake a whisper, spun from air,
In nature’s quilt, woven with care,
In every silence, life’s stories weave,
In the winter night, I dare to believe.
