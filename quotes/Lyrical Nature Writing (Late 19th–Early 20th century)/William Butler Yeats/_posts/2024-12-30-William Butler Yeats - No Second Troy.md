No Second Troy
Why should I blame her that she filled my days
With misery, or that she would of late
Have given in kindness, but for a view
Too close to love the one who stood between?

Why, I roam with the waves and mountain rain,
Kiss the kneeling earth with life, at once my soul.
For I am free at last, and soon I will be gone.

- William Butler Yeats
