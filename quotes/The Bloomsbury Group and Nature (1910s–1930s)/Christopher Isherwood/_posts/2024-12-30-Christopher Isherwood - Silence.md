Silence  
Here beneath the oak,  
In the heart of stillness,  
I find solace.  
Nature whispers softly,  
Her secrets wrapped in softly  
Falling leaves,  
While the world,  
With its cacophony,  
Fades to a shadow.  
In distant echoes,  
A bird’s trill breaks  
The tender hushed song  
Of the quiet space.  
And in this stillness,  
I come to know  
The depth of love,  
Found in the silence.

- Christopher Isherwood
