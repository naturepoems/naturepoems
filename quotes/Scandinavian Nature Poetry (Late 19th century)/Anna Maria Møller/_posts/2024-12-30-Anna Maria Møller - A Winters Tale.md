A Winter's Tale

Snowflakes falling, soft and white,
Blanketing earth, a wondrous sight,
Hushed and quiet, the world transforms,
In winter's grasp, the spirit warms.

Frosted branches, a crystalline tree,
Nature's jewels for all to see,
In the stillness, a peaceful tone,
In every flake, a dream is sown.

With firelight dancing, shadows cast,
We find comfort in winter's past,
The seasons turn, a timeless thread,
In nature's heart, we find our bed.


- Anna Maria Møller
