At Blackwater Pond

At Blackwater Pond  the tossed waters  settle and draw away  from their edges  like a breath.  The ripples linger.  I can see the fish beneath,  the shadows that dart and weave  in the coolness,  the quicksilver flash  of life here under the surface.
And I think of moments  when I have known such  stillness, such depth,  when the body has opened like  a flower, and I have realized  I take nothing more for granted  than this living beneath the water,  this breath  beneath the surface.

- Mary Oliver
