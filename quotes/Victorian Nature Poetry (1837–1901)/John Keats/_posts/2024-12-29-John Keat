Light Dances Upon the Waves

Light dances upon the waves, serene,
   The azure sea whispers melodies true;
Like a painter, the sun with gentle sheen
   Brushes the world in a golden hue.

Where the sea meets the shore, the wild grasses sway,
  Waves coax the sweet scent of salt from the deep;
  The pebbles, soft-pattened through long years, lay
   In quiet repose while the oceans sleep.

Bright colors leap through chaos of sound,
   With each rush of the tide, the heart beats anew;
And in nature’s embrace, all worries unbound,
   The spirit finds peace in the rhythmic glue.

O, the beauty of a sunrise to behold,
   Transforms the world's face with colors aglow;
As the day breaks free from a night, dark and cold,
   Light dances upon the waves, endlessly so.

- John Keats
