The river flows with stories old,
With every bend, a journey shared,
Whispers of the brave and bold,
In nature’s heart, we are ensnared.

The banks hold memories, deeply sown,
Of laughter, love, and tender grace,
In every ripple, a seed is grown,
Of life that dances, time can't erase.

- Richard Wagner
