Evening

The sun has set, and left the world to dew;
  The valley laughs, as in prayer, envelops his head;
  The trees are blushing in the evening sun;
  The owl is in the moon that touches the bed.

Be it so; some light breaks forth in a lowening sound,
  And music played on me, with silence danced around;
  Whole realms seem born anew, for their grace has drawn down  
  In silent wonder, an air-pageant crowned.


- Gerard Manley Hopkins
