The Mountain's Call

In the shadows of the mountains,
Where the ancients weave their tales,
I stand beneath their might,
At the edges of the trails.
Their peaks, a kingdom’s crown,
With steadfast, silent power,
They tower over valleys,
Time, a mere flower.

Each stone is a memory,
Of the earth's tumultuous fight,
The lava of creation,
Now sits in tranquil light.
I seek their silent wisdom,
In the rumbles of the stone,
Where nature’s heart beats louder,
Than the tyrant’s lonely throne.

— Wole Soyinka
