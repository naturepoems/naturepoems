The sense of space lies dips,  
In the bends when I choose,  
In momentary slip,  
I seek the sunlit muse,  
With green mare rising slow,  
The stars,  
yet, yield even glow.  
Call it the day to sigh,  
Where wind surges over reeds;  
Happed by the lay  
of evening screams,  
Air hums soft  
at dusk's succeed.  

â€” Hilda Doolittle, "Waves"
