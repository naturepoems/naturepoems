The Sky

By night, accruing from its graceful arch,
A thousand dawns towards the eternal edge,
A darkness rippling at the feet of stars—
I kneel, aware of how the air shall bare
the essence of the world;—For my heart
Unfurls in light when the day awakens,
And the damp earth sighs towards your arms.
To seek the gloss of this fused glass,
I rise in wonder, entranced and swayed,
Too far to forget; the glimmer of all nature,
Etched bright on whispers falling from the day.
