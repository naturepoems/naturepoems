Upon the lakes, the silver ripples weave,
The breath of dusk implores the lull of night,
Where dusky swans in mirrored motion cleave,
Soft whispers blending with the waning light.

Beneath the arches of the mighty trees,
The green, like emeralds, in cascades flow,
While petals brush 'gainst tender boughs with ease,
In natureâ€™s clasp, the wildflowers grow.

And as the world descends to tranquil dreams,
The quietude embraces every shore,
With all its sighs, the forest softly seems
To sing the praises of its sacred lore.

- John Clare
