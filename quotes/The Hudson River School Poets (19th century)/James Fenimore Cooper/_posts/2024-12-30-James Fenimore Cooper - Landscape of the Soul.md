The landscape before me,
   A palette of hues,
Where the wildflowers blossom,
   And the skies wear their blues.

As the rivers do wander
   And the winds sing their song,
I find peace in the splendor
   Where the heart can belong.

Let me dwell in the beauty,
   And embrace what I find,
For in Nature's sweet bounty
   The soul is entwined.

- James Fenimore Cooper
