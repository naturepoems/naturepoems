Mending Wall
Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
And spills the upper boulders in the sun;
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.

The work of hunters is another thing:
I have come after them and made repair
Where they have left not one stone on a stone,
But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,
To please the yelping dogs.

The gaps I mean, no one has seen them made
Or heard them made, but at spring mending-time
We find them there. I let my neighbor know
Beyond the hill; and on a day we meet
To walk the line and set the wall between us.

We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
Oh, just another kind of out-door game,
One on a side. It comes to little more:
Just another kind of out-door game,
But not every man is at home to it. 

Before I built— I had an even wall
And I think that I see within.

- Robert Frost
