As twilight descends, stars blanket the night,
In harmony woven with shades of soft gray.
Each flicker of light, a beacon of light,
Guiding the soul as dreams come to play.

In the whispers of night, where silence is gold,
A lullaby cradles the weary and bold.
Nature sings low, her mysteries unfold,
In the embrace of the night, the heart becomes whole.

- Anna Brigadere
