The last leaf fell today,
    trembling against the light,
and the world stands still.
   But under a carpet of gold,
    seeds wait patiently,
        wrapped in dreams.

How long can silence hold
     the promise of the sun?
   Iâ€™ll rest here until
          the light breaks again.


- William Stafford
