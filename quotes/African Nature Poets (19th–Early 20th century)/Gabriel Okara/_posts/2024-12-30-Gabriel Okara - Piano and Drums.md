**Piano and Drums**  
The soft piano  
The drums  
Far away  
Are quieting  
Stillness awake  
The pierces me  
But slow in me  
The soft piano  
Makes still  
Smooth on the land  
And in the air  
But the drums  
Too loud  
Drowning the past  
While I try at ease  
The flow of daffodils  
Glimmering the past...
