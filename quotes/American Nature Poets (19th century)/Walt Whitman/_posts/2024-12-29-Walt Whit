The Clear Spirit

The clear spirit that graced my dream,
Its vision so wondrously built,
Beyond the shroud of understanding,
In nature’s embrace, its essence instilled.

I touch each leaf and flower anew,
The mountain heights, the brook’s soft flow,
The wind’s whisper in the evening dew,
Reminds me of life, and the seeds we sow.

Walt Whitman
