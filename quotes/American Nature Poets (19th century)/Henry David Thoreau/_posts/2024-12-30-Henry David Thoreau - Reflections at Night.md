At night the moon you see,
Reflects in the glowing bay,
The tranquil waters speak,
In silver whispers sway,
Among trees forming shadows,
And dance to the soft sound,
Natureâ€™s tender embrace,
In the symphony profound.

Owl hoots in the distance,
Echoes the night so free,
In this gentle whirling,
I finally feel the key,
To the heart of nature,
And space of every thought,
Here life directly flows,
To the peace that we sought.

- Henry David Thoreau
