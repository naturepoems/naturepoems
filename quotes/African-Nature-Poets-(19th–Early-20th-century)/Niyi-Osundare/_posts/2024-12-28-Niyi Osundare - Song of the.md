Song of the River

Listen, my heart,
To the river's murmur,
Its lulling whispers
Like a mother's lullaby.
In its depths, secrets,
In its bends, reflections
Of the sky's vastness,
Clouds painted on water.

Each ripple, a story,
Each splash, a laughter,
Flowing, always flowing,
Through time's precious hand,
It gathers the light,
It swallows the moon,
And dances with the stars.

O river, my river,
You carry not just water,
But the essence of life,
The fragrance of the horizon,
The heartbeats of the mountains,
And the sighs of the valleys.
You are the pulse of the Earth,
The ever-evolving song
That springs from the depths
And pours into eternity.

- Niyi Osundare
