Spring

In the tender wake of sun,
Where early blossoms tremble free,
A breath of life has just begun,
Awakening the world to be.

The robins sing their sweet refrain,
A melody of joy and grace,
In every garden, each domain,
Spring paints the earth, a soft embrace.

The streams rejoice in laughter clear,
As daisies bloom in fields of gold,
In vibrant hues, a message dear,
Of life renewed, and joys untold.

Oh, let the warmth of springtime stir,
A dance of colors wide and bright,
For in this season’s gentle purr,
The world awakens, filled with light.
