Let the night’s cool hand glide softly on the flake,
As the moonlight breaks through, a shimmering veil.
Ode to the magic in shadows we make—
A fleeting embrace where worries turn pale.
I will wander in wonder, my heart set aglow,
By the peace of the garden, where dreams gently sail.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
