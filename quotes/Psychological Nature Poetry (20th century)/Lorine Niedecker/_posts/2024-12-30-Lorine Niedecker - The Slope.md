By the sublime surface,
   A tune rises quick in thrush,
Carrying the evening through dense growth;
And beads of dew do rest soft,
Across lengthening shadows of glad ground.
I think of life as embraces stride,
On sun-warmed winds, we retract.
The refuge grows quickly, space opens,
And trills uplift the storm between—
Self requires space infinite;
This longing blooms open, soft fingers of grace—
Here—behold richly diverging worlds!
