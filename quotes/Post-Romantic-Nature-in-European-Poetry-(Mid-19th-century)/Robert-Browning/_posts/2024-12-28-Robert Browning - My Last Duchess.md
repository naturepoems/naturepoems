My Last Duchess  
  
   (Excerpt)
   
   I. 
   
   That’s my last Duchess painted on the wall,  
   Looking as if she were alive; I call  
   That piece a wonder, now: Frà Pandolf’s hands  
   Worked busily a day, and there she stands.  
   
   II. 
   
   You see her, the marvellous rhyme of  
   An old-world charm—  
   A glimpse of gardens blooming,  
   While the winds do alight amid the fields of beauty.  


- Robert Browning
