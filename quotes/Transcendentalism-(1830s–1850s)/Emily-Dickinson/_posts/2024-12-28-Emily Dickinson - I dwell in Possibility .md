I dwell in Possibility –  
A fairer House than Prose –  
More numerous of Windows –  
Superior – for Doors –  

Of Chambers as the Cedars –  
Impregnable of Eye –  
And there – on the Horizon –  
A Corner – in the Sky –  

Much Holier than a Sermon –  
Lighter – than a Bird –  
Inviting – to the Spirit –  
And the Heart's Desires –  
—Emily Dickinson
