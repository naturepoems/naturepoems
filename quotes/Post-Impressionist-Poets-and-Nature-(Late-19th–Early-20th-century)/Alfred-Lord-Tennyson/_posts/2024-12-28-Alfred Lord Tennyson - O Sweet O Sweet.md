O Sweet! O Sweet! 

O Sweet and quiet place,
Through the thick leaves—
There is a bubbling brook,
And flowers and mossy stones!
So could a heart awake,
In peace, in pleasure roam,
In Nature’s true embrace,
And find there utmost home.

I therefore will rejoice,
And sing in serene skies,
And blend my heart with thine,
Wherever Nature lies!

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
