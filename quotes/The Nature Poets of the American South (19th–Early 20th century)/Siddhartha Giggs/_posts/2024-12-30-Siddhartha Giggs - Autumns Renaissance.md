Autumn leaves tumble, a kaleidoscope spun,
Painting the ground with hues that could stun.
The crispness of air heralds the change,
In this cycle of life, everything feels strange.

Squirrels gather acorns, a dance of the agile,
Preparing for winter, their hearts full of guile.
In the embrace of nature, I learn to let go,
As seasons remind me of life’s ebb and flow.
