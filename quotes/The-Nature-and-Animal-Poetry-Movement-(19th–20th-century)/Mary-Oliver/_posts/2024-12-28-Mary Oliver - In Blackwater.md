In Blackwater Woods
Look, the trees
are turning their own bodies
into pillars
of light,
are trailing their dying
leaves
like flames
the walking stick
of a ghost.
And the wind,
snaking its way
through the trees
is a kind of touch—
a kind of prayer,
a kind of blessing.
I will love it too.
But I have to understand
that sometimes
it is good to be humble,
to sit quietly in the dark,
to not be foolish and grand,
but to hear the gentle, genuine
voices in the woods.

- Mary Oliver
