An Ordinary Evening in New Haven

It was a matter of light,
The diamond chime of sun,
It was a matter of faces,
Mosaic as they passed by.

Each day a world collaborated
In the valley: spring lay down,
The trees spread that ease, the walls
Were leaned against the darkness.

With mere summer in the air,
Those who pass claim seasons,
And live the slender hour
Of undetermined place.
                                 


- Wallace Stevens
