In the depths of the forest,
a world unseen unfolds,
where light filters dreamily,
a sanctuary for the weary soul.

Moss carpets the ground,
a velvet touch,
roots intertwine,
a life force hidden below,
a reminder of strength,
woven in silence,
in every breath of wind,
every rustle of leaves.

Here, I find solace,
a place to reflect,
a quiet conversation
held in the company of trees,
a promise whispered in the dark,
a bond forged in nature’s embrace.

- Alice Walker
