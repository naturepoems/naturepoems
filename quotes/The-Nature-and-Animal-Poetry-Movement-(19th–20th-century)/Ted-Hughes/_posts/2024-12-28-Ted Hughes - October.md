October Salmon

    I

     The sky burns like flame,
    From the sunset of autumn
    Wi(ai)iwi, the holds shift and part.
    The silent surge of the leaves
    Fades down to a whisper.

    II

    All that should cry is dying,
    The leaves rustle their memory,
    Like schoolchildren’s laughter,
    Their small voices entangled with darkness,
    They go quietly when the clouds beat them down.

    III

    Salmon swim through the turns,
    Blind to tomorrow, driven by the blood
    Of ancient dreams seeping through;
    Each worm, roach, and path,
    They surge and dance in their own haunting river litanies.

    IV

    I see their pale bodies flash,
    Agli, giving up the world,
    Their vital bodies can’t hold their breath
    As they splash against death’s lily.
    


- Ted Hughes
