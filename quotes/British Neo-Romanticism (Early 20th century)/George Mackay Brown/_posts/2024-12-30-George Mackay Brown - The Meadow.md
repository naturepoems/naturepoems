The Meadow

The meadow lies in autumnâ€™s hand,
The last of the flowers drifting,
Their petals a whisper on the wind,
Every blade of grass a memory,
Each color a story to a wandering heart.

Under the oak, the air thickens,
With whispers of a ghostly past,
Golden stalks bend in the soft dusk glow,
As if bowing to the earth, to the sky,
In a dance that only twilight knows.


- George Mackay Brown
