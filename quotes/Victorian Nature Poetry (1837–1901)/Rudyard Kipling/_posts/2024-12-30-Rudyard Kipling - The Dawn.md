The dawn is a-dawing, and the night is a-darn;  
The owl is a-purring, and the night is a-farn.  
The stars are a-dancing, and the moon is a-laugh;  
For the morn is a-marching and the night is a-path.  
 
Now the sun is a-swinging, and the world is a-cheer,  
The sky is a-singing with the birds drawing near;  
For the wind is a-whispering and the dew is a-cool;  
And the Nature is playing by the riverside pool.

- Rudyard Kipling
