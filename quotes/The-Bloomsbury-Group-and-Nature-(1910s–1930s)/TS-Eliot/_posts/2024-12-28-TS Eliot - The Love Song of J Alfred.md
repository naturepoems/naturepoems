The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock

S'io credesse che mia risposta fosse
A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,
Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.

Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
Streets that follow like a tedious argument
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelming question …

Oh, do not ask, "What is it?"  
Let us go and make our visit.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window panes;
The yellow smoke that slides along the street;
Rubbing its muzzle on the window panes;
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains;
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys;
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
And seeing that it was a soft October night,
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.

And indeed, there will be time
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
Dressed in the azure light of a tepid day;
There will be time, there will be time
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
There will be time to murder and create,
And time for all the work and days of hands
That lift and drop a question on your plate;
Time for you and time for me,
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
And for a hundred visions and revisions,
Before taking of a toast and tea.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

And so, it is with the seasons.  
Through the winter solstice, the dark moon
And half-moon of February  
Bring new growth to the branches of spring.

I prepare for visits, with careful  
Attention to detail.  
The days will rear and bend,
And sway as the tides alter my careful plans.

I take my time; time does not take my days.

The brown leaves fall, and in the spring,
An eagle sails overhead.  
The sun shines upon the poppy gardens,
The glacial air, refreshing as spring  
Brings life back into the cities of men.

I too am alive beneath the fiery sun.

- TS Eliot
