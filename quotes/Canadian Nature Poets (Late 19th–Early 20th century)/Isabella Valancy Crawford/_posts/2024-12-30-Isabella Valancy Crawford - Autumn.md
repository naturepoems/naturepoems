Autumn

O golden tangled autumn!
  When the leaves are turning red,
When the rustled trees are solemn
  And the birds have flown away,
When the dappled skies grow lonely
  And the days grow short and gray.

Sweet the air that breathes before
  The winter’s icy reign;
The soil, the wind, the flower
  Are filling up the brain,
And the heart sings sweetly knowing
  The peace in the golden grain.

- Isabella Valancy Crawford
