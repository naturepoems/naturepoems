The Mountain Trail

Step by step I wander,
On the rugged path high,
Where the eagles soar,
And the mountains kiss the sky.

The air fresh and clear,
With the scent of the pine,
A journey of wonder,
In the wild, I align.

Oh mountains, vast mountains,
In your majesty's thrall,
You remind us of beauty,
In the grandness of all.

- John Thompson
