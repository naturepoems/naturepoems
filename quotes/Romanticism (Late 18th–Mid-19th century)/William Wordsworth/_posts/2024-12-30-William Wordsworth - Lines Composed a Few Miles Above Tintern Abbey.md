A few short years and all shall be made plain,
Yet in this moment, tranquil is the sun,
And Nature, like a mother, hugs her inner pain,
The wings of winds embrace the day begun.

Each sigh of life shall rest upon the trees,
Each tear of joy shall find a brook to flow,
The rivers speak of calculated ease,
While flowers burst in secret gardens, grow.

Here in this world bewildered, we bestow,
The gaze of stars that rule our ardent night,
Through each unending hour of bliss we know,
Our spirits touch the sky, its radiant light.

So let us gather all this peace and life,
Among the sounds of crickets soft and true,
And shed our worries, leave our worldly strife,
In Nature's realm, I'm always born anew.

- William Wordsworth
