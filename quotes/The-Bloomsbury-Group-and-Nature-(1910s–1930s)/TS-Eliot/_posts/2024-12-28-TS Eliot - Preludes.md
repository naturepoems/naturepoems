Preludes

I
The winter evening settles down
With smell of steaks in passageways.
Six o'clock.
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.

And now the light, faced with slight chaos, shines  
Over the fish and stone — drifting with light;  
While new love is still growing.

You see nature's ardor  
In the rise of fog drifts and ease;  
Fractured lies scratch the dawn.

Never regard the glimmered paths;  
There was mourning grace, darkening upon seven  
As taste of the world appeared to change.  

The dark breath rolls off pavement  
As streetlight bulges  
Standalone beyond the railway nights.

II
The textured sounds swirl in  
The stale silences by modest tea:  
And in old red-gold  
Moaning sounds immerse within the air.  
   
Neither leaves nor beauty left.  
The uncalled mire across a star.  
To rise is to fade, where we suggest.

For as time strikes a bell,  
There blooms and drowns  
All shapes and silence  
Unbound that rises over lamenting paths.


- TS Eliot
