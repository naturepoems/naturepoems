In the Heart of the Woods

In the heart of the woods I wander,
Where the light filters through leaves aglow,
Each step taken for a moment in ponder,
In the beauty that I wish to know.

The soft moss cushions my feet so tender,
Each bird song a sweet serenade,
Nature’s peace is a splendid mender,
In the quiet, all worries do fade.

So let me linger a while in this space,
Where the world feels far from my door,
For in nature’s very embrace,
I find the answers I yearn for.

- John Burroughs
