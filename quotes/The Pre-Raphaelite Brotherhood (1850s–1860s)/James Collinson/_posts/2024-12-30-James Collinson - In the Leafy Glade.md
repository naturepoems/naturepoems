In the Leafy Glade


  Adrift in the leafy glade  
  Where the shadows sorrow still,  
  The lilies are falling as brave  
  As the rush upon your will;  
  I hear in the absents sinewy days  
  A heart that beats on and on —  
  While life in flown shadows, jars  
  With a blight of a fading dawn.
