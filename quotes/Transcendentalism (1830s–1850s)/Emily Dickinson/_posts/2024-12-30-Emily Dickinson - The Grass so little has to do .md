The Grass so little has to do –  
A Sphere of simple Green –  
Yet outward, and inward –  
Grows over the silent scene –  

And while the World with Floods is doused,  
The Clouds which keep Mount Maru  
Are quaking, and do not lose,  
The Child – who is but dew –  

This is the Movement, and the Time,  
Virgin Alpha and Omicron –  
Like Frost upon the Forest –  
It does not go alone –  

To other things than External Forms  
The Grass is innocent,  
But hidden in its Color,  
The Spirit of a Life –

- Emily Dickinson
