The Landscape
Majestic hills, and valleys wide,
In nature’s tapestry, I abide;
The river flows, a sparkling thread,
Through fields of gold and poppies spread.
Where sunlit meadows rippling stand,
I roam the beauty, the silent land;
In every leaf, and strand of grass,
With love for nature’s charm, I pass.

- John Clare
