quote: "Fog wraps the hills snug,  
a cloak of mystery worn tight,  
each tree a spirit  
whispering in the twilight.  
The soft call of the valley,  
a breath held in the hush,  
a secret dance of shapes."

Fog wraps the hills snug,  
a cloak of mystery worn tight,  
each tree a spirit  
whispering in the twilight.  
The soft call of the valley,  
a breath held in the hush,  
a secret dance of shapes.
