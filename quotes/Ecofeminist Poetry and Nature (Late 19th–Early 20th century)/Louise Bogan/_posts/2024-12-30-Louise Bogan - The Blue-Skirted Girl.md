The Blue-Skirted Girl  
from her dark skirt, opalescent,  
    shimmering paint of the sea  
    passes a sweep of bombed  
mountains, destinies,  
   and lays it on their cheeks;  
   fainting figures cry out--  
        all are sure--  
   to save her from herself,  
    to touch her shoulder,  
   exploring that vast space  
   of illuminated sky.

- Louise Bogan
