Spring Awakening

Awake, dear earth, from slumber deep,
As tender blooms begin to peep,
The crocus, daffodil's cheer,
Whispers of spring, the heart draws near.

Birdsong fills the morning air,
With every note, a joyous prayer,
As life returns in vibrant hues,
In nature's rhythm, we find our muse.

The sun’s warm touch, the skies so blue,
Breath of rebirth in all we do,
In this dance of life, we partake,
With every step, our spirits wake.


- Anna Maria Møller
