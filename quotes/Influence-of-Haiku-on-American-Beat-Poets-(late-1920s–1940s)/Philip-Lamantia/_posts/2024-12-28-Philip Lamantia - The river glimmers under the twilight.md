author: Philip Lamantia
quote: "The river glimmers under the twilight glow,  
A silver snake winding through the land,  
It beckons to the trees to dip their roots,  
Into the current’s gentle flow,  
Each ripple tells a tale of time."

The river glimmers under the twilight glow,  
A silver snake winding through the land,  
It beckons to the trees to dip their roots,  
Into the current’s gentle flow,  
Each ripple tells a tale of time.
