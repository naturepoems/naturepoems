To hear the winds in the trees' song,
To feel the weight of the world grow soft,
Where every shadow seems to belong,
And thoughts arise like smoke aloft.
I find in this the essence of right,
That nature's arms shall cradle me,
And guide my dreams through the starlit night,
In every whisper, her symphony.


- Matthew Arnold
