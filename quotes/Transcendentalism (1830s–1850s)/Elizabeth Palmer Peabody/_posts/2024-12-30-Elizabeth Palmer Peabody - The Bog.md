The Bog

In the bog, by the willow,
I sat, breathing deep,
My heart swelled with the shadow,
And the silent sweep;

I saw the great streams of water
Float by me, wavingly,
And the wild flowers of spring,
Dripping with tears of dew;
A woodchuck played in the dust,
A frog croaked through chance,
And the winds swept through marshes,
With a wild, subtle dance.

- Elizabeth Palmer Peabody
