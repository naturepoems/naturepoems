With a Vision of the Valley of Elah

I must look back no more! The world is round,  
And all is on its way;  
The past is veiled; a soft repose  
Lies silent on the day!  
The afternoon is clear and bright —  
The sun a golden globe,  
A thousand twinkling rivers run  
In this immortal robe.  

I seek the valleys rich and green,
The valleys where I dwell;  
Where slumbers gently the blue sea  
Upon a silver shell!  

O for the azure over me,  
Draped in celestial blue!  
Chained to my thoughts no longer,  
O vivid sanguine hue!  

But the sands of time are slipping;  
Cherish once again  
The vision of the valley  
That trembles in the rain!

- William Hazlitt
