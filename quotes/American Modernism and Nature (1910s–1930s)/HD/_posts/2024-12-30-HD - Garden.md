Garden

  Because I could not
    lie still
         in your bed,
I lay here to listen,
    to the garden that sings.
         To the dew,
      the [the] heavy splash
        of red flowers
        filled with evening,
    as shadows settle began
  like a plume,
    the flickering hours,  
  that escape, like flowers.
“With your touch, I am? 
    Go, flee.”
    
  I shall remember,
  like the flowers,
  of the moon, in silence.
  —H.D.
