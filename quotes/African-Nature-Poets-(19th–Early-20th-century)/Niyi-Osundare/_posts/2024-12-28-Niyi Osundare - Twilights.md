Twilight’s Embrace

When the sun dips low,
And the horizon sighs,
There’s a magic in the twilight,
As the world exhaled,
Washing the day’s imprint,
With strokes of muted colors.

Shadows stretch and yawn,
Merging into the landscape,
The sky adorned with a veil
Of purple and gold,
While cricket symphonies arise,
Breaking the hush with heartbeats.

O twilight, your embrace
Is a tender kiss on the cheek
Of a tired world,
In your soft light, I find closure,
I dissolve into dreams,
A peaceful surrender to night,
Wrapped in the whispers of dusk.
