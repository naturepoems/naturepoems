Embrace of the Mountains
Majestic peaks that touch the sky,
Guardians of the earth below,
In their embrace, we find our peace,
In the hush of snow where whispers grow.

The air is crisp, the silence deep,
Echoes of ages in each stone,
With every step, our spirits leap,
In natureâ€™s realm, we are not alone.

- Aldona Gustava
