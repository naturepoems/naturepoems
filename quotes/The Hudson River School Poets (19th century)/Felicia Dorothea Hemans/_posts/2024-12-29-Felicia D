The Grave of a Poetess

Oh! rest in the peace of the tranquil night,
A dewâ€™s drop falling, a leaf from height,
Go measure thy days in gentle shade,
Thy little hours in the deep glade.

This dark repose, so gently warm,
Will nurture thee in all thy charm,
For beauty, not weariness must dwell,
In the peace so finely woven from the spell.

Come forth then, dear, and sport so free,
From bough to bough, beneath the tree;
And in each flutter, and every sigh,
Thy heart, at length, will never die.

The hush of sweetness fills my soul;
For gifted hands to thee have stole,
With every willow, evergreen, fence,
Nestled in love with such delight thus hence.

- Felicia Dorothea Hemans
