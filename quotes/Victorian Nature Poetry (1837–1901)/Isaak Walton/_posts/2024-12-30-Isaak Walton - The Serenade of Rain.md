The gentle rain, a sweet refrain,
  To bring the earth to life anew,
  It softens hearts and eases pain,
  As every drop speaks love so true.

The fragrance rises, earth’s embrace,
  The flowers bloom and smile by day,
  In water’s dance, find nature’s grace,
  A serenade to show the way.

- Isaak Walton
