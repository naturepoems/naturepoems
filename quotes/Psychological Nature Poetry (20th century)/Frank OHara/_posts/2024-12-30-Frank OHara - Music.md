Music
I feel the pull of trees
climbing up around my heart,
hitting the highs we’d climb,
     the branches shaking with delight
as the leaves catch the air,
   it’s a stream that rattles the ground,
        a whisper of wings,
    bright with all that moves, 
      and I too,
        dance among the flowers,
alight, hoping for the bright
    shadows that shake the night,
        larks too high,
  like the laughter falling
  from a child,
  laughing at the stars above.

— Frank O’Hara
