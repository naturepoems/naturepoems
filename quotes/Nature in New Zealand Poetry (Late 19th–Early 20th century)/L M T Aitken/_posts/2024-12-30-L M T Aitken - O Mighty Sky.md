O mighty sky, with clouds in flight,
   Thy palette rich, with sun and rain;
Bestow thy warmth, the golden light,
   That bathes the earth in life again.

The rainbow arcs from storm to calm,
   A promise bright with colors bold;
Beneath its charm, a soothing balm,
   The stories of the day unfold.


- L M T Aitken
