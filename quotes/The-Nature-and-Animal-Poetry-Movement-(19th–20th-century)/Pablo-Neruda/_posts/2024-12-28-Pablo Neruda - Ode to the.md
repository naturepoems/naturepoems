Ode to the Sea
letting your kisses
fall upon the waves,
your bright arms twine
with the sky’s embrace,
carrying the whispers of
countless birds,
the salt of the earth,
they linger:
dancing with fish,
liquid with life,
enduring the storms,
with wisdom,
your sapphire grace.
When I stand by your shore,
my heart would be lost,
my soul in your current,
yet so deeply found.

- Pablo Neruda
