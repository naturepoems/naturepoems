The trees that have it in their pent-up minds
To be lost, or deeper in the woods,
Are frightened, and will not be good. 

Some intelligence in them thinks,
As sleep they woo in the dark woods,
What a simple thing to act upon this, 

If what they say isn’t true
It isn’t totally sad, especially
If a branch or two or three

Tumbles over under the weight 
Of the gnashers of summer here; 
Broken in halves by an early frost.

We are all at once all that remain
Of a wilderness untouched, unmade—
The trees are clearly tightening their hold,
Trees that have it in their pent-up minds

To be lost, or deeper in the woods.

- Robert Frost
