In the stillness of the forest deep,
Where sunlight dapples through the leaves,
I find a sanctuary from the world,
In nature's arms, where the heart believes.

The rustle of leaves, a soft wind’s sigh,
Dances through the ancient trees,
An orchestra of whispers, a timeless tune,
Connecting my spirit with all that is free.

Each step upon the emerald path,
Is a journey into the soul’s embrace,
In the heart of the woods, I discover,
The profound beauty of nature's grace.

- Umberto Saba
