Sunset

The sunsetâ€™s fire blazes high,
Painting the horizon red,
As night unfurls its velvet cloak,
Wrapping the earth in its thread.

Clouds drift like scattered dreams,
A canvas touched by golden light,
While whispers of the coming night
Bring forth stars from their slumber tight.

In this moment, I breathe deep,
The beauty of nature's art,
As day gives way to tranquil night,
A new beginning in the heart.

- Langston Hughes
