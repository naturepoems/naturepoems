A Dream

As sweeps the sun each hour,  
Look down upon me there,  
As feels an open flower  
That bids the forms of air,  
Were hence this lifeless moon,  
Under a dark fair sky,  
Sweet gleams will guide an eye,  
And I will capture you soon.  

There blending towards the place,  
Where forest glens spread wide,  
To gain the grey face,  
And be in kind as sidelong zephyrs glide.  
So close a glee, as crowns you  
In rebounding grace and glows;  
A shadow-cat takes eyepieces,  
As letters from chapels show  
Sweet air beneath the growth.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
