The river roars,
    a metallic serpent,
    unwinding through the concrete muscles
    of the city, pulsating,
    vibrant like a new thought,
    consuming all in its path.

I stand, arms wide,
    ready to capture its vigor,
    the raw strength of limitless motion
    that feeds our relentless hunger for speed.

- Filippo Tommaso Marinetti
