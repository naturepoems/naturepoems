San Martino del Carso

          At San Martino,
          I remember
          The earth,
          How it was discovered
          By the eyes,
          And how it trembles
          And rises, like a wave.
          My heart,
          Like a flower in the wind,
          Blooms permanently; 
          At the same time, it falls
          And seeks remembrance,
          Leaving the past behind, 
          Where you died, where I die.  
          
          
          
          
          
          
          


- Giuseppe Ungaretti
