When I was a boy,
I had a mind to live,
And I used to take pleasure
In placing a little fish,
In shallow water,
In the sun-lit strewn
Little pool,
And curving around it,
Gently between the rocks
Prayed a plaintive prayer for the fish.
I loved it,
Perchance in the truth of my heart,
That I might possess
What I did not grasp,
And rejoice in the Painted turtles
That came at my feet.

And fell to watching the White Egret,
Solitary and in the tree,a shadow moved,
And as its talons drew
The color from the ploverâ€™s stone,
It blessed the water
In shimmering shades of
Lazuli and emerald.
There soft waters,
Rock-heavy green,
Looking down on the lilies
That nibbled at the light.

- Henry David Thoreau
