Beneath the branches wide and strong,  
Where roots that twine like secrets rest,  
The earth holds mysteries profound,  
In every heartbeat of her breast.

The creatures dwell in harmony,  
In forests deep and meadows bright,  
Nature’s chorus rings in time,  
Under the watchful stars at night.

Oh, may we learn to tread with care,  
To hear the whispers of the land,  
And cherish every breath of air,  
In this wondrous world so grand.

- Andrej Ērgļs
