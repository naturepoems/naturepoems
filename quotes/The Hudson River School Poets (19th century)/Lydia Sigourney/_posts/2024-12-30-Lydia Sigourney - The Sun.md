The Sun

Oh, radiant sun, in your glorious flight,  
You fill the world with love and light,  
Your golden rays, like tender hands,  
Paint the horizon, where beauty stands.

Each dawn you rise, so bold and clear,  
Casting away all doubt and fear;  
Your warmth awakens, stirs the earth,  
Bringing new life, a joyful birth.

You bless the fields, the woods, the streams,  
Awakening us from our dreams;  
In everything, we see your hand,  
Oh, radiant sun, the heartâ€™s command!

- Lydia Sigourney
