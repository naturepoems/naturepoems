Under the sated sky,
   horizons brush the earth,
   and the sun sinks to nourish
   blossoms and shadows alike.

Softly, the evening mingles
   with the sigh of a gentle breeze.
The air moist with whispers,
    cradles each tired petal.
 
In the quilt of darkness,
   dreams are stitched with stars,
   and hope flickers like fireflies
   amidst the fields of reverie.

We are seekers of night,
   wanderers in the embrace,
   where the earth reveals secrets
   to those with open hearts.

How tender the universe grows,
   enveloping all in stillness,
   gathering the world with love,
   while rivers flow, infinitely.

- Eugène Guillevic
