Michael
An Heroic Ballad

The poacher and his dwellings so set store,
Where the Earth is anxious, in love so sure,
Enduring on those scales, which thus compel
The tale of joy, or harrowing pain to dwell.

The hunter’s heart could gentle bear At eve’s late time
The sweet hour of soft shade; as a chance was free,
Under the whispering trees, where dreams might grow
In twinkling bright; and shifts of balmy time
That yet dwell sweet in glee,

Lay, as to pluck, and know her face, yet dear;
The boy’s heart of clay was firm, nor frail would grope,
Who talks with silence in the midst of chasing days
And makes him see, alone, as living should;
The land, where flowers bloom and song can try,
While tender thrumming bursts with every tear,
The earth was made to dwell beneath the sun.

And well, a weft of twining vines confess
A heart, in fisher’s toil, must soon go forth,
To paddle naked floats on rivers high,
With pleasure, shall he write anew—
As he stands tall and strong in strife of heart;
For suns will shine, and stars redeem,
If even in passing time the boy should gain,
Nor evade the prey within his ken,
Where every edge of freedom screams of pride,
Each bar of his return at dusk, enfolds.

While full of pride, yet tender arms caress
Their home, shared joy and love that never died;
A fire upon the dark remains, unseen,
That lights the hearth, and hunters sing of praise
Then every human heart shall strive, shall know
That all we love shall follow star nor sighs;
For days shall win their victories, these words
Of Michael, the old wife and son still try:
And home made whole, from hearts strong and like I lie.

--- 

So tell me where the tie goes slow,
Between the hunter’s care and thine shall dwell,
That lonely bowler finds all his way to roam;
Yet still he waits, nor soon forgets the girl,
But in four tender hearts lie grace,
As one chants in dark the heart shall rear,
That in their bond was love of life made proud.

All gentler scenes a bridge may hold aloft
For one mist-shines on eve to call
For joy shall wheel the air, and comfort us again!
Wound not the sacred time of those best days,
Let all be told what Michael’s heart will lend.


- William Wordsworth
