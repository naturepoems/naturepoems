quote: "A starlit night, the wind is still,  
As silence weaves through shadowed trees.  
Crickets sing their nightly thrill,  
Nature's hymn, a soft reprise."

A starlit night, the wind is still,  
As silence weaves through shadowed trees.  
Crickets sing their nightly thrill,  
Nature's hymn, a soft reprise.
