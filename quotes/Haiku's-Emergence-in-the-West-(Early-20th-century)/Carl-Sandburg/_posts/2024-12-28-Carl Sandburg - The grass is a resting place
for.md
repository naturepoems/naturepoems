for shadows of clouds,
for the striding light,
or the soft back of a doe.
Here silence is a glistening air,
where each whisper tells of summer."

The grass is a resting place
for shadows of clouds,
for the striding light,
or the soft back of a doe.
Here silence is a glistening air,
where each whisper tells of summer.

- Carl Sandburg
