The Trees

The great trees stand in their solemn sight,
With breathes of whispers like flickering flies,
Against the sward where lovers might
Tread joy to the outer prize.

Yet autumn beckons a day begun,
When leaves shall twirl in colours deep,
And I shall wonder, when daylight's done,
If the dreams drift dark in their deep!

- Thomas Hardy
