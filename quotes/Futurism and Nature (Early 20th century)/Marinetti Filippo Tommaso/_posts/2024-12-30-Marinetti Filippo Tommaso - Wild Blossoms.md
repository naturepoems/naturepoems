Wild Blossoms
Blaze in frenzy, gorgeous flowers!  
You fill the fragmentary spaces  
huddling upon the paths of the earth,  
we sing together while  
elements blend!  

Let us give birth to spaces  
with colors that hover!  
I wish to bloom  
your sweet pain into waves of voice!

In your warmth,  
restless forms of ecstasy bloom;  
I dance among your praises,  
that a fever of charged lives,
shiver from leaf to petal!

- Marinetti Filippo Tommaso
