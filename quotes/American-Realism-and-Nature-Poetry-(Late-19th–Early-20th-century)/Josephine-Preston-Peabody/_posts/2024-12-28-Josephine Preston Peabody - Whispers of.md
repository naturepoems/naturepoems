Whispers of Autumn

When autumn casts her golden net,
And leaves like fire begin to fret,
The hills are wrapped in crimson hues,
And nature wears her rarest views.

The wind brings tales from far away,
Amongst the branches begins to play;
A rustle here, a soft embrace,
Each leaf has found its perfect place.

The harvest moon shines bright and clear,
As nature whispers, “Take to cheer.”
For in this season, rich and grand,
Each moment holds a painter’s hand.
