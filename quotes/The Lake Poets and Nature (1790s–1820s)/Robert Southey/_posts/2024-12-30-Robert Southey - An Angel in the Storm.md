An Angel in the Storm

A Vision.

A cloud was on the mountain’s crowned steep,
  Where the woods both mourn, and hope to claim again,
And on the road two wandering spirits weep,
  For they feel the eastern breeze as one feels pain.
They embrace by the stream's green edge,
  But tremble at its frightful change,
Where the earth, as a face of thoughtless pledge,
  Looks at calm where each foot upon its range—
Should find before judgment share
  The beauty that exists not here.

Thus spoke the first: "This life,
  It is filled with great desires;
While instincts of the heart like life,
  So sorrows play like lyre;"
And back again, with gentle hush,
  The second answered wise:
"No need for these reproaches—come,
  For see the sun arise!".

Slow touching hands fell softly down,
  While glory summoned forth, and gone,
Yet vanished forms are perfect now,
  In summer’s glooms to bless the lawn.

Through every birth of calm change, we two
  Though greatly glad, shall cease for delight,
Ah! hear the legends of peace within complete,
  And, laughing in the past—still night.

- Robert Southey
