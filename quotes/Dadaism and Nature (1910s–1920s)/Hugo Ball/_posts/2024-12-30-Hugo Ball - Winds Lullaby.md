Wind's Lullaby
A whisper, a caress,
The wind cradles the trees,
In its gentle embrace,
While stars ride the darkness,
Promises caught in their shimmer,
Weaving tales on crystal threads.

Catch me if you can,
The clouds call from above,
Rushing by like fleeting thoughts,
Fleeting, yet profound,
With the night bathed in cool relief,
Cradled by the lullaby of the breeze.

- Hugo Ball
