A vast Measured Poetry –  
The Woods of Evermore –  
Where Tranquillity is Nestled –  
And Birds their Chantes pour –  

The hum of Bees that linger –  
To saucy Lilacs’ sigh –  
And Whispering Wind that carries  
Such Secrets softly by –  

Here silence lives forever –  
In Heartbeat warmly sewn –  
And Nature writes her stories  
In sighs, known to the Sown –  


- Emily Dickinson
