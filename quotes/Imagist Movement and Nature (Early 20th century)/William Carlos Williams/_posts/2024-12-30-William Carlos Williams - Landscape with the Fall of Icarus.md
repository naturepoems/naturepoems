Landscape with the Fall of Icarus

According to Brueghel

when Icarus fell

it was spring

a farmer was ploughing

his field

the whole pageantry

of the sky

is filled

with the sun

the sun coming down

upon him

and the sun

wasn't cold

a man in the field

saved his plough

by virtue of being

again and again

until the day

is done.

- William Carlos Williams
