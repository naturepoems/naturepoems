quote: "Underneath the boughs where sunlight dapples the ground,
A carpet of bluebells dances in the breeze.
Nature’s laughter spills from each petal's edge,
A symphony of color playing softly with ease."

Underneath the boughs where sunlight dapples the ground,
A carpet of bluebells dances in the breeze.
Nature’s laughter spills from each petal's edge,
A symphony of color playing softly with ease.
