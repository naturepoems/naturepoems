The Summer Day

Who made the world? Who made the swan, and the black bear?  
Who made the grasshopper?  
This grasshopper, I mean—the one who has flung himself  
out of the grass, the one who is  
so extravagant and alive,  
that I can’t take my eyes off him.  
     I mean the one who is  
     eating sugar out of my hand,  
     who is gazing around with  
     his enormous and complicated eyes.  
     Now he lifts his pale forearms  
     and thoroughly washes his face.  
     Now he snaps his wings open,  
     and floats away. I don’t know exactly  
     what a prayer is.  
     I do know how to pay attention,  
     how to fall down  
     into the grass,  
     how to kneel down in the grass,  
     how to be idle and blessed,  
     how to stroll through the fields,  
     which is what I have been doing all day.  
     Tell me, what else should I have done?  
     Doesn’t everything die at last, and too soon?  
     Tell me, what is it you plan to do  
     with your one wild and precious life?

- Mary Oliver
