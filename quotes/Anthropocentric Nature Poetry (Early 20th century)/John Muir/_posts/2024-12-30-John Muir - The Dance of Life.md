The Dance of Life

With every rustle of the leaves,
The dance of life, my heart believes,
With fluttering wings and chirping calls,
In nature’s court, the spirit sprawls.

The golden sun begins to rise,
As dew drops glisten under skies,
In every bloom, a new delight,
In every shadow, hope ignites.

As seasons change and moments pass,
The dance continues, life amassed,
In nature’s hand my joy is found,
In every beat, we’re all unbound.

- John Muir
