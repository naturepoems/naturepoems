Symphony of Us
Together, we wander lost in laughter,
Through meadows blossoming in hues anew,
Each petal that falls and waves that roll,
Creating symphonies crafted by our souls.

Where the horizon gives way to dreams,
And every color sings a tune,
Tonight we shall let candles flicker,
In harmony with the moon's sweet smile,

- Hugo Ball
