The Harvest

Golden fields that dress the land,
With fruits that hang in rich delight;
A bounty sown by gentle hands,
To greet the heart on harvest night.

Nature yields her sweetest pause,
As sunsets paint with fiery glee;
In gratitude, the world applauds,
For every drop, and every tree.

- Clara Barton
