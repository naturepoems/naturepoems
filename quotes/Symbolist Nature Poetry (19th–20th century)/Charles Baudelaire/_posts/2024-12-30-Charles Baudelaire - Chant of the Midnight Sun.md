Chant of the Midnight Sun

The sun is like a rich, heavy drink,
Spilling its warmth across the horizon,
Like molten gold it pours from the brink,
And enchants us with its hypnotic lure.

In the timeless night, where shadows creep,
The sun transcends into an ancestral grace,
A surreal prisms linger in deep,
Embracing the world with an ardent pace.

How vast the reaches of this sweetened sky,
That holds the whispers of our lives in hands,
Where lilies burdened with dew gently sigh,
Holding timeless tales of untrodden lands.

The midnight sun with a lover’s glance,
In every blushing petal, a sweet romance.

- Charles Baudelaire
