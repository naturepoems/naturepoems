Upon the shores where ocean meets land,  
Waves whisper secrets of the deep,  
With the tide pulling hearts and dreams,  
As the sun dips low to sleep.

Seagulls call in a dance of flight,  
A ballet against the setting sky,  
Natureâ€™s lullaby of salt and sand,  
Embracing those who wander by.

- Kristjan Jaak Peterson
