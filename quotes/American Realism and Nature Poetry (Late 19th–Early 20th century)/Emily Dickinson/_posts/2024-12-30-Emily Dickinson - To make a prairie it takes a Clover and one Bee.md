To make a prairie it takes a Clover and one Bee,  
One Claw of theClouds, and one Stormy Day,  
And Microscopes that work –  
And then the Stranger's way –  

For Graceful Hold the deep interior –  
And Darling stirs and seeks –  
That whispers red and rising –  
Though the Sin uses a Beam –  

But Oh, for Graceful Hands –  
For Eyes that Seek and Seek –  
And warmth of the Heart's purpose  
That drove the Wintry Oak!  


- Emily Dickinson
