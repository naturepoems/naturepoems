Under the pale moon, the mist conceals,
In the tranquil depths where the longing heals.
Nightingale trills amidst a somber theme,
Light plays softly on a gentle stream.
Cloaked in dreams, the world fades away,
Where heartbeats gather, long night or day,
I stumble on paths wrought in silvery glow,
Holding the echoes of all I could know.

- Arthur Rimbaud
