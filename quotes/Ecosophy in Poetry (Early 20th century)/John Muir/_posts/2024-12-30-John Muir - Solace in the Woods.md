Amidst the mountains high and steep,
Where nature breathes and sighs,
In those ancient woods, I find and keep,
The solace of the skies.

With every footstep, the earth reveals,
A symphony of life that sways,
In the heart of ‘wildness,’ my spirit heals,
As I wander through Nature's ways.

- John Muir
