In the Quiet Glen
In the quiet glen at close of day,
Where twilight takes the sun away,
The gentle breeze whispers low,
And dewdrops fall like tears of glow.

Here lilies bloom, white as the moon,
While soft crickets sing a sleepy tune,
And the stars awake in the velvet skies,
As the hush of night begins to rise.

Oh! to linger in the dusky light,
O’er the brook that shimmers out of sight,
With thoughts adrift, I breathe it in,
The tranquil peace where dreams begin.

In Nature’s arms, I find my rest,
For here, my world is truly blessed,
In the quiet glen, where beauty reigns,
I find my heart, refreshed from pains.

- J C R Selwyn
