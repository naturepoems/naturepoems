I love to see the summer’s morn
   Upon the hills the dew is born,
When to the vale the leaves descend,
   And whisper to the winds that bend,

When all the balmy air is bright,
   When fleecy clouds are weaving white
And dreamy vapours float along
   In languid lines of grace and song.

O let me wander where you will,
   To watch the cuckoo on the hill,
To mark the flowers all in their prime
   And kiss the silver bells in rhyme.

- John Clare
