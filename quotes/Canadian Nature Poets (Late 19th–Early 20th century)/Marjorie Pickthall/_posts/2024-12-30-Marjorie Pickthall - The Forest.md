The Forest

In the heart of the forest, silence reigns,
Where the shadows are deep and the whispering gains,
Soft moss carpets the earth, a carpet of green,
Nature's lush beauty, pure and serene.

The trees stand tall, a guardian band,
With branches that stretch like a welcoming hand,
In their shelter the wild stories unfold,
Of life that is ancient, of wonders untold.

- Marjorie Pickthall
