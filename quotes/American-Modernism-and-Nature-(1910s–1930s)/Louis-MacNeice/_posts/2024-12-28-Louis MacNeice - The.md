The Mist
  
  A blanket soft, a quiet shroud,  
  The mist rolls in, a spectral cloud,  
  It hushes all, a gentle balm,  
  Embracing night with a soothing calm.

  The world is veiled in silvered gray,  
  Where shadows sleep and secrets lay,  
  A whispered world, at nature's whim,  
  The landscape dims, and edges thin.

- Louis MacNeice
