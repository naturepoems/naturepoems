A Country Life

Now the spring is in the air,
Life awakens everywhere;
The woods are clothe’d with green attire,
And hills are blush’d with blossoms bright.

The brook that brims, and birds that sing,
Bring blissful news of lasting spring;
Let us abandon this busy grind,
And seek the solitude for peace of mind.

- Robert Herrick
