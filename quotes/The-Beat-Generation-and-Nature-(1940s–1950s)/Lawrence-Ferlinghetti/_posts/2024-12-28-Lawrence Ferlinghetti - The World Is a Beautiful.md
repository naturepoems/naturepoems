The World Is a Beautiful Place
The world is a beautiful place
To be born into
If you don’t mind happiness
Not always being
The same as
A gun in the hand of a man
Who is running away

The world is a beautiful place
To be born into
If you don’t mind
A few tears, sometimes,
Or the laugh
Of a maniac

The world is a beautiful place
To be born into
If you don’t mind
A few scars, sometimes,
Or the scream
Of a wild bird

The world is a beautiful place
To be born into
But not for me, not for me, not for me.

Sometimes, it would be better, to stay quiet
But how could I shut my eyes?

- Lawrence Ferlinghetti
