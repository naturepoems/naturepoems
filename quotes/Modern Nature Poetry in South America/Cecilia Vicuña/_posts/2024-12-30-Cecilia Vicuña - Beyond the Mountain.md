Beyond the mountain,
in the softness of moss,
whispers a language
of ancient roots,
there lies a world,
a secret, fragile universe.

The eagles circle
with a deliberation
that speaks of time,
of generations,
of the stories told
by wind and tree,
where sunbeams curl
like fingers of fate.

- Cecilia Vicuña
