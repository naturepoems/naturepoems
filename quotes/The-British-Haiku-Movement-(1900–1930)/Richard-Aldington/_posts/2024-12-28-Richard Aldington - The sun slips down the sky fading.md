Mountains silhouetted against the dusk.
The night owl stirs in the thickening trees,
His soft hoot echoes through the cool air."

The sun slips down the sky, fading, fading,
Mountains silhouetted against the dusk.
The night owl stirs in the thickening trees,
His soft hoot echoes through the cool air.
