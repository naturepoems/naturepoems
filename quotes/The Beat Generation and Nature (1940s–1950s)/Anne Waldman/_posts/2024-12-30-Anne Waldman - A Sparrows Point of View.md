A Sparrows' Point of View
Something in the way the sun
is poking through the leaves of bird
and water brings us to this point—
outside a suburban church
underneath the tongues of
yellow blossoms bending low
I hear the sparrows called, seem to be
watching each other call me
into that world of gray river.
Not to spill the claylike secret
of New Jersey before the storm, but cousin,
these dirty little crawlers, with heads
poking through the grass, beaks open, chattering—
a beautiful dumb ass sort of sound—
who compound my impressions, 
dragging earth
as my song.
Their lives are a twisted promise, 
down in the dirt.
While the sun shifts, signaling the rain.
It is here I kneel, taught
how to scavenge, how not to care.
