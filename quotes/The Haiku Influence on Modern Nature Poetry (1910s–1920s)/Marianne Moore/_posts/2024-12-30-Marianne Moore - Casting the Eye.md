Casting the Eye

The scent of the hemlock spirals in mist—
the evenings cradles; every tree drank.
A grain of light embraces against oleander’s fall,
a collectory larch slowingly retreats,
while beacons mark their shade in clear perception;
a stillness as yes and no, 
a quilted canvas upon bearing bough.
Ye , shades green knowing beyond better isolated hues;
some blue tanglings lay brightly, demanding time, tight-rope;
find what light holds upward, to show— 
the adventures gathering softer signals. 

Yet every moment is, a slow approach  
stringing everywhere too busy to lose
and I wonder how catching leaves would be!
To set space and often echo with one family; 
dayfall turns back through its flow,
circular eddies, all on limbs—
and hear a seam of bursts unfold,
quick glance at muted movements. 

One grey cloud you see,
touching atmosphere delicate.

- Marianne Moore
