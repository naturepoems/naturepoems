Nature's Dust

Now only mouse fur appears,
Of iron wood or skeleton keys,
A nip in the earth, alive, to unseal
No starlit mysteries unbold.

The sky in its quivering fingers,
Whispers beneath uncharmed suns,
Lifeblood glistening the brow of trees,
And I bow once more, beyond death.

- Gwendolyn Brooks
