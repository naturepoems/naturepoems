Far North Queensland

Far north of the green,
Where the coast meets the sky,
Where the sun spills its laughter
Across the hills of sand,
And the trees touch the sea.

Here, the beauty of the wild
Sings through the air,
Where the waters run clear as dreams,
And the coconuts sway,
Dancing with the wind.


- Judith Wright
