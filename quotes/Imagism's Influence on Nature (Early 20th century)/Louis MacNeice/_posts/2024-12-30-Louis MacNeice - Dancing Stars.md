Unseen, the stars are dancing,
In the boundless night of delight;
And the cool of the woods runs free,
As the essence of the earth feels bright.

Among the trees that whisper in grace,
Their golden arms cradle dust
While I wander on with my lost face,
In the glow of evening I trust.


- Louis MacNeice
