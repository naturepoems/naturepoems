The Sea
All day I have watched the waves
    As they crash upon the sand,
And the seagulls cry above them,
    With their wings like silver spanned.

The tide rolls in like a lover,
    A sweet caress upon the shore,
And the foam dances merrily,
    As it dreams and dreams once more.

Oh, the sea is a joy forever,
    A spirit wild, a gentle soul,
And I wander beside its beauty,
    Shaping dreams that make me whole.

- Dorothea Mackellar
