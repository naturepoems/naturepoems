quote: "A lone bird sings on the edges of dawn,  
Her notes weave sweet through branches drawn;  
While lilies bend to grace the stream,  
In this stillness, life seems a dream."

A lone bird sings on the edges of dawn,  
Her notes weave sweet through branches drawn;  
While lilies bend to grace the stream,  
In this stillness, life seems a dream.
