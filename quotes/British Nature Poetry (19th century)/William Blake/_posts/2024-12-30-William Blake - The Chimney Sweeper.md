The Chimney Sweeper

When I was a Cart, I wrote a song,  
And a beautiful thought began to unfold;  
"What, I thought, if the mountains were blue,  
What if the woods and waters were gold?"  
In radiant laughter the heavens did sing,  
As I roved through the valleys, in search for a king.  
But where were the flowers of innocence,  
And the laughter of youth and its sway?  
With chains and bare feet,  
A chiming bell haunts my play.  
Let the wind be our friend,  
Let the rivers roll free!  
For in nature's hand,  
We embrace our destiny.

- William Blake
