The Law of Life

Old Keesh lay there as snow fell thickly, memories surging like beasts within the deep, hollow eyes of the elder; life dwelled in the icy cradle of nature, the rhythm of the wilderness drumming in harmony, as he felt the slow pull of time and embraced the inevitability of life tradition, a fitting ritual laid bare among the dead branches of the pine.

- Jack London
