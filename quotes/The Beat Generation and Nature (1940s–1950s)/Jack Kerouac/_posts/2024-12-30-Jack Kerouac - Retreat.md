Retreat

In this sweet retreat,
I wish to find the hidden
grace of nature.
Be among the whispers,
be among the pines,
be beneath the cascading
streams, listening for the
wisdom of the earth.

How gentle are the edges
of the streams,
how vibrant the life
in the meadows,
making melody with the
gentle sway of every
breeze.

Let this be my refuge,
let it draw me close,
where the background noise
of the city fades,
where I can hear
my heart in tune
with everything that lives.
