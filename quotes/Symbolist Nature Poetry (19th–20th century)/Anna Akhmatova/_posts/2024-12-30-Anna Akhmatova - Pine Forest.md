Pine Forest

In the pine forest, tall and green,
I wander through the scented air,
In every breeze, a story whispers,
Of nature's beauty, wild and rare.

The needles fall like gentle rain,
A carpet soft beneath my feet,
The forest breathes, alive and vast,
A tranquil place where hearts can meet.


- Anna Akhmatova
