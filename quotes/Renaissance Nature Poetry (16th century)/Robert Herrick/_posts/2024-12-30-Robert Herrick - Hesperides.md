Hesperides

Gather the golden flowers that bloom,
Sow seeds to grow in natureâ€™s tender womb,
For Time shall sweep, and Life shall flow,
With memories spun in golden glow:

Thus each tender tendril brings
The weight of joy that freely springs,
And all these moments, soft and rare,
Will float into the fragrant air!

- Robert Herrick
