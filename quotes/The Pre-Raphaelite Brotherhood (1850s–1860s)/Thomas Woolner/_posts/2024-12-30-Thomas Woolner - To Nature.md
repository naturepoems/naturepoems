To Nature

O Nature! thou art mine, 
I wander in thy paths divine;
With every breeze that stirs,
I feel thy voice amongst the firs.

With every dew upon the grass,
I see thy gentle hand that has
Made every flower thy beck and call,
And in thy presence I am small.

Yet grander far than aught may seem,
I find in thee the heart's pure dream,
A whisper soft, a tender sigh,
In beauty's bloom, I live, I die.

- Thomas Woolner
