Oh, talk not to me of a name great in story!
The days of our youth are the days of our glory;
And the bright sea’s blue boundless, the mountain’s proud stead,
Have no limits as wakeful as this, when we tread.

For nature is the queen of the world so bright,
Whose bounty and beauty are always in sight,
And when I wander in her verdant space,
I find solace, peace, and nature’s embrace.

- George Gordon Lord Byron
