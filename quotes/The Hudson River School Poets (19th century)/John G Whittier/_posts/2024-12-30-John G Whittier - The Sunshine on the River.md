The Sunshine on the River

The sun is born of the river mist,
And the river is breaking forth,
Its golden beams touch the twilight gray,
And the world responds in mirth.

The mountain streams sing soft and clear,
As they tumble down the rocks;
The light ascends through the branches tall,
Bringing joy in glittering flocks.

- John G Whittier
