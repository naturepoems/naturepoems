An Octopus

The octopus is cut of
        that not-quite-light
        of Europe:      
            of stuff uncanny
            but good,
        the allotted road.
    Yet: what shall we
        do?      
    The cephalopodâ€™s
    housekeeping is bare.
       The feet are piercing; it
       is alien; the matter
       is unfathomed, eight.
