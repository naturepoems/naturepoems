Autumn Leaves

Crisp the air, and golden light,  
As Autumn weaves her cloak so bright,  
The leaves, like flames, in colors grand,  
A tapestry upon the land.

They dance and twirl in breezes cool,  
Nature's art, a silent rule,  
Though falling down, they softly lay,  
In beauty’s arms, they find their way.

Oh, fleeting time, how swift you glide,  
Each leaf a memory, side by side,  
In Autumn's grace, I learn to see  
The beauty held in letting be.

- Margaret Munro
