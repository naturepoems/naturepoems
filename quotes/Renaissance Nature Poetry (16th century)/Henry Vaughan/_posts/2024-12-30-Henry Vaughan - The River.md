The river flows like time unspent,  
Beneath the measuring trees it sings;  
In every ripple, joy is lent,  
Nature’s voice upon the wings.

And in the bending rushes green,  
The currents tell of laughter’s strains;  
In nature's presence, pure, serene,  
The echo of eternity reigns.

--- "The River"

- Henry Vaughan
