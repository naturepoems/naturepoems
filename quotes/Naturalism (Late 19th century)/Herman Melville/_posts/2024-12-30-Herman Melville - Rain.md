Rain  
   
Soft falls the rain, a gentle sigh,  
To quench the earth’s unfailing thirst,  
With silver streams that weave and cry,  
In nature’s arms, our hearts immersed.  
  
It washes clean the wearied way,  
Refreshes leaves, and blooms anew,  
As petals quake, the children play,  
In every drop, a wish comes true.  
  
For in the rain, a life reborn,  
Each puddle deep reflects the sky,  
In tunes of joy, where dreams are worn,  
The lullaby of earth awry.

- Herman Melville
