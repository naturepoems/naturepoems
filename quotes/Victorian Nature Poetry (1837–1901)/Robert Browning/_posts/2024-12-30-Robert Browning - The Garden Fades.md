The Garden Fades  
The garden fades: but the bloom shall not die  
So long as my love is alive in the night:  
In the chill, in the dew, all the flowers blush high,  
Their leaves tremble with beauty and whisper delight;  

But now, like a bird that has flown from the cage,  
The bloom that I cherish falls over the ground;  
The moths of the dark night encircle the page,  
And sorrowful dreams like dark shadows abound.

- Robert Browning
