It is the spirit that we must bow
To the glory of the heart and mind,
Leaving behind the dust of the city,
To walk in nature of the unconfined.
In the grove where shadows play,
The whispering leaves do softly sway.
The winds of change do gently blow,
Unraveling truths we long to know.

- Edgar Lee Masters
