Memory scurries like a wind,
Through the grass, where flowers stand,
Each petal a piece of nostalgia,
In a ground, grazed by sunlight's hand.

And the trees, like wands in a spell,
Guard the laughter of children long gone,
Their echoes remain in the hollows,
Though the time winds away at dawn.

Yet in this momentâ€”stillness falls,
Captured in shadows long as dreams,
The heart thumps vocabulary of nature,
Speaking deep truths among the beams.

- Stephen Spender
