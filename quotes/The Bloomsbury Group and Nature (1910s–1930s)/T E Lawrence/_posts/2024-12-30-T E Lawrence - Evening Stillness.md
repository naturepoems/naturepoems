Birds on the wing have vanished,
   The stillness of the evening hangs
   Like twilight in a crystal glass 
   Tossed into a blooming haze.
   
   The lilacs stretch their arms,
   Opening to a world 
   That inhales the scent of earth
   In earthy, earthy sighs.

   The fronds of ferns beat like hearts,
   Eyes watchful for the dawn,  
   And the twilight finds its curtains
   Closing through the whispering leaves.
   
   A tranquil pond reflects the orb,
   Each wave repeats the stars,
   And as the night hums its tune,
   I find the quiet brings me peace.

- T E Lawrence
