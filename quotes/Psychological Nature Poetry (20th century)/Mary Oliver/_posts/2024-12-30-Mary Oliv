The Gardener
In the prickly wilds of nature,
in the tangled woods of the heart,
where flowers come to life
and gates close behind,
I found you in all your shades,
and the seeds you made,
as they took root below,
whispers of growth under the wild sky.
Together we placed our hearts,
cast them like light,
for where they fell over the soil,
bound to the earth,
they opened into a wondrous embrace,
among the riches unseen,
every bloom a promise,
a sense of unutterable value,
where the sun still travels,
every breath hits a note,
each moment sings freedom,
a wildness belonging to the dirt,
blossoming endlessly, 
where it has only left
and sky meets again
with the bird songs of our time.

- Mary Oliver
