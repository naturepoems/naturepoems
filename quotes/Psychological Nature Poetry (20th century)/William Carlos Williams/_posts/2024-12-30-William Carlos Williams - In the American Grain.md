In the American Grain

The mountain  
stream flows  
quickly by;  

leaps  
into the valley  

of downcast trees  

and fools of man  
who damp the dirt.

The roots touch it  

and make it flow  
after its own speaking.

Dampcode  
at the dark  

as the elms  
move.  

Coolness flies  
between them  

clean and sure,  

a breath without  
hills.

- William Carlos Williams
