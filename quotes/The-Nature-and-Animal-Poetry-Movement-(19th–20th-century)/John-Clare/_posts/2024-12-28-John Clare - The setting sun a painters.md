The setting sun a painter's brush,
With hues ablaze, the evening's hush,
Each stroke on canvas, nature’s hand,
Creates a picture, serene and grand.

The twilight wraps the world in peace,
As gentle shadows find release.
A soft embrace of night around,
In silence, yet, a sacred sound.

For in this hour, the stars begin,
To unlock the heart deep within.
Let me linger here, where night descends,
In nature's arms, where all transcends.
— John Clare
