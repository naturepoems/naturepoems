When clouds convene in heavy strokes,
   Against the canvas of the day,
   Nature lets her brush of dreams
   Create the art of stormy play.

   Thunder rumbles like a choir,
   Harmonizing roars and cries,
   And lightning strikes with brilliance
   Illuminating darkened skies.

   Each raindrop falls in melody,
   A rhythm of creation's song,
   The earth drinks deep, rejoices, sighs,
   As nature shows where we belong.

- T E Lawrence
