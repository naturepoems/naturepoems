---

With every leaf and every bough,
The wind brings whispers to my ear;
It speaks of day, of night, and now—  
In nature’s heart, I feel you here.

The streams, the hills, the fragrant air,
Will hold our love with tender care.
Let every flower be a vow,
As I declare my love for you now.


- Edna St Vincent Millay
