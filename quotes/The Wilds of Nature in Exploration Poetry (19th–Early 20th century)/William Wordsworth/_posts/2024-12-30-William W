I wandered through each chartered street,  
  
Near where the chartered Thames does flow,  
A sightless gaze, a heart so fleet,  
  
But hard and scarred, there was no glow.  
And all around, the mind's delight,  
  
Such beauty lost to sight's own snare;  
No tranquil water, no blessed night,  
  
The darkest pathways bear despair.  
  
Is this the city of my dreams?  
  
This place of walls and bounds of might?  
'Twas not the grandeur of the schemes,  
  
Nor built for praise and shining light.  
  
I seek but Nature’s little things,  
  
And lose myself by her fresh streams;  
For here, a memory still springs,  
  
And laughter hugs the sun’s bright beams.

- William Wordsworth
