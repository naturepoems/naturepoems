In the heart of the woods, where silence reigns,
Whispers of the earth cradle our thoughts;
Nature's breath weaves through branches and leaves,
Guiding us deeper into the realm of peace.

Every shadow tells a story untold,
Each path a journey woven in time;
Among the ferns and the emerald hues,
We find our truths in the embrace of life.

- Anna de Noailles
