To the Moon
Moon, when I gaze upon your face,
I feel you whispering softly in the night,
The world grows dim, but in my heart the light
Of dreams comes forth, and all my cares erase.

With silver beams you touch the sleeping trees,
And bid the winds to hush the whispering leaves,
Awake their loves, and hear the nightingale,
And bring forth joy, while softly you unveil.

Your beauty shines upon the delicate flowers,
Whose petals drink the dew that you bestow,
And when I see you fade into the hours,
My silent heart can only yearn for more.

- William Butler Yeats
