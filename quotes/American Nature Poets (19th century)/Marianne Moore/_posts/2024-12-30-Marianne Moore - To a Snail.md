To a Snail

Leisurely, the snail goes by,
Through green leaves and drifting petals,
In measured time, on a journey slow,
Mapping out dew-kissed trails, glistening paths,
Gazed at by passing sparrows, sunbeams, and clouds.
You slide on, dear wanderer,
Each glistening footfall, a testament to patience,
As you traverse through lush fields of emerald grass,
Bringing joy in your soft, gliding hand.

- Marianne Moore
