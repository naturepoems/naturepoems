Field and Fen
Through field and fen I wander free,

Where every sound sings back to me,

The bubbling brook, the swaying grass,

The fleeting shadows, as they pass.

The skies above, so vast and wide,

Invite me forth, an endless tide,

With every step, my heart will soar,

For nature’s gifts, I can’t ignore.

- Richard Jefferies
