To stand beside the sea, and offer up
My heart unto the sable, hollow, depths,
To see the waves break in their boundless, mad
Wildness of joy—no captive’s sight can pass;
But Nature stands, eternal as the seas,
In immortal calm like an Olympian Man,
And evermore asleep without a dream.

What of the fervor that beats within?—
What of the yearning heart, and burning brow,
And falling tear?—such are the dreams of men,
Too oft they pass, like bubbles on the wave,
But Nature’s beckon, though she seems austere,
Holds in her arms a solace like the sun.

- Lord Byron
