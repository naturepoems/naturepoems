Whirlwind Serenade
Nature sings in wild, swirling tones,
A cacophony that frees the soul,
As winds of change flutter and fly,
Unfurling the map of the whole.

Leaves tango in unpredictable patterns,
Grass bows in reverence before the storm,
A tempest of voices, nature’s laughter,
Swirling around, fierce and warm.
