The Song of the Abyss

In the quiet of a darkened depth,
Where the dreams of pools and drifts beneath,
Lucid waters swirl, without a breath,
Carrying shadows, whispers of grief.

With glassy charm, they pull the soul,
Each glimmer promising solitude’s grace,
Yet in their depth lies the unseen goal:
The eternal riddle of a timeless place.

O heart, release thy burdened fears,
Abandon hopes that swirl and sway,
For in the water’s embrace, through years,
You’ll find what’s lost, what can’t decay.

Listen—there is a song out there,
Of depths that hum a sunken lore,
A hymn to echo in silence rare,
Of shadows gilded, wisdom’s core.


- Valery Briussov
