Lullaby of the Leaves
As evening falls and silence spreads,
The whispering leaves sing low and sweet,
A lullaby where sorrow sheds,
In nature’s arms, our dreams repeat.

They tell of journeys taken far,
Of nighttime’s depth, of morning’s light,
In every rustle, a gentle star,
In nature’s cradle, we find our flight.

- Aldona Gustava
