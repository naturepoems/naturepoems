Under the veil of the twilight sky,
The horizon glows in shades warm and bold,
With a sprinkling of light and whispers of night,
The stories of the earth begin to unfold.

Each star a sentinel watching afar,
Whispering tales of journeys unknown,
As I gaze up, feeling small yet alive,
In the vastness of nature’s poetry, I’m home.


- Anna Akhmatova
