Laus Veneris  
When the light of love is in the heart,  
In the song of it, in the soul of it,  
There are leaves in the trees, and a flower's part  
In the flower's part is the heart of it.  
And the grass sings low to the mossy ground,  
And the wood sings loud to the wild flower's crown,  
But the song of the heart is the soul of it,  
And the heart of it is love's golden part.
