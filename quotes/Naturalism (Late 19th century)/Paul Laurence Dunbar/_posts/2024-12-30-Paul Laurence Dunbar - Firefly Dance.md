As evening falls, the fireflies dance,  
In twilight's glow, they take their chance.  
With flickering light and gentle grace,  
They weave a magic, a sweet embrace.  

In laughter soft, and nature's cheer,  
We find the beauty ever near.  
With open hearts, we feel the call,  
In natureâ€™s love, we are one, we are all.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
