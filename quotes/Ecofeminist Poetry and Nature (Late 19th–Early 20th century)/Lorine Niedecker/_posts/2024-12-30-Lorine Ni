Time in Nature

Beneath the canopy,
hours slip like leaves,
a slow dance of stillness.
It is here, surrender speaks,
a dialogue with the birds,
a communion with every branch that sways.
Time pauses, and I am held,
a part of this great story unwritten,
a thing that folds into moments,
woven into the fabric of life.
