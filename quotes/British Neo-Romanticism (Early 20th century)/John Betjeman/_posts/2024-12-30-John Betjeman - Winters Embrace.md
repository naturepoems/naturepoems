A winter's morn, the world aglow,
With frost that glistens all around,
Each breath a cloud, in soft tableau,
In silence, beauty can be found.

The birds that linger, sing their tune,
Against the crisp, embrace of white,
And in this moment, 'neath the moon,
Nature wraps me, pure delight.

- John Betjeman
