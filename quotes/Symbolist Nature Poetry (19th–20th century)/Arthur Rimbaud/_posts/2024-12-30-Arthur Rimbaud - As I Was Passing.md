As I was passing through forests so bright,
With a heart laden, yearning, filled with light,
Leaves twinkled as if a thousand stars,
Starlit, shimmering, with no wars.
The golden sun struggled to escape,
Through the green bower from its dark drape,
I met two birds, chirping away,
Questions and answers in their own play.

O nature divine, I cling to thy breast,
Ramparts of life where sorrows find rest,
In the rustling of leaves, to be reborn,
Bathed in dew that the dawn has adorned.

- Arthur Rimbaud
