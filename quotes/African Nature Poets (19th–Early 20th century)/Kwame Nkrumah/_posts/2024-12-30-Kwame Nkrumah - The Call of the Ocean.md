The Call of the Ocean
Oh, mighty ocean, your waves rise and swell,
With stories of sailors, where legends dwell.
Your depths hold the secrets of ages gone by,
As tides shift and dance beneath the vast sky.

From beaches of gold to your wild raging core,
You sing of adventures, of journeys ashore.
In your embrace, I find peace and a muse,
With whispers of tides, my heart you infuse.

- Kwame Nkrumah
