The Dusk  
As I wander through fading light,  
   the dusk weaves between  
     broken branches,  
tall grasses clutch paths  
   while the stars peek through  
the sipping shadows  
   of the settling night,  
witnesses to my quiet heart,  
   tracing the sky’s work, gold to grey.

- Louise Bogan
