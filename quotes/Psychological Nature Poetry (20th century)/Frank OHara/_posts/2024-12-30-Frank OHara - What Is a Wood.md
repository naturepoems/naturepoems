What Is a Wood?
A wood is a place
    shadowy and full of life,
     where a deer moves gently
and the leaves,
    bowing softly in the breeze,
    carry whispered news
that only they would know,
  they work tirelessly,
    to gather sun,
while the sun slinks down
softly behind the hills,
   a wood can be
    a forest to chat,
    and all whispers amongst trees,
       a dialogue purer
            than any book.

— Frank O’Hara
