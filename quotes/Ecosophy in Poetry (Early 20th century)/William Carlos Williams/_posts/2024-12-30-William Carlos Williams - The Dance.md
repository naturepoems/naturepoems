The Dance

My lady

has gone

as the

sun

sets; the

pale

moon

rises

speaks to
the night.

The

wind

calls me.

I have

lost her

among

the stars

Waves

of night

roll

over our

dance.

We move

on the floor

of a thousand

invisible

ghosts.

Lost

in the

waves of

time.

This is

the end; circle

round and

round and

round.

Here we

stand

together.

Then we

fall

as the

music fades.

- William Carlos Williams
