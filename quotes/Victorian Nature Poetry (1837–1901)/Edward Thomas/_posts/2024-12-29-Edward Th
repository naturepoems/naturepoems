Beauty

In every leaf that falls and flies,
In every bird that mourns and cries,
Lies beauty forged in quiet beat,
The whispering tones in joy complete.

The glories of the woodland green,
The shades of life so softly seen,
Bring forth a heart both free and wide,
A spirit found where truth will guide.

For beauty dwells in simple guise,
A dance through shadows, light that sighs;
In every heartbeat, moment’s trace,
It lingers fond in nature’s grace.


- Edward Thomas
