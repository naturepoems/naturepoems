Trees, trees,
silent, breathing, scheming
against the winds.
Climbing, reaching
into the blue,
leaves whispering secrets
I cannot hear,
yet I feel their shadows.

Beneath the boughs,
roots plunge into earth,
a tangled web
of memories and dreams.
Here I dwell,
a part of the cycle,
swayed by time,
nature's gentle hand.

In the dawn's light,
a world awakens,
and I am but a witness,
a fragile being,
yet entwined with life.

May I remain,
a fleeting thought,
in this great expanse,
where everything is painted
in shades of green,
in the rustle of leaves,

- Alice Toklas
