Bright Star

Bright star! Would I were steadfast as thou artâ€”
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night,
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like Nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,
The moving waters at their priestlike task
Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,
Or standing alone on some placid brook,
That, 'tis a solitary sanctuary,

       John Keats
