here is the poem
  of a flower that
  some like;
        and how
  they walk among
        the wild,
         the good.
         Ferns spread right and left
            among broad
            strokes of color
             and laughter
        blooms, till butterfly
          is born again; 
  among the lilies of the sun
  ---------  all the little flowers
   come to bloom
   will alight like swans
   ascending summer skies.

- E E Cummings
