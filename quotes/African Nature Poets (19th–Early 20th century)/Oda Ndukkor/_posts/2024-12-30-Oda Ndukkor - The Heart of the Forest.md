The Heart of the Forest
Deep in the heart of the ancient woods,
Where silence speaks and beauty broods,
Tall trees whisper secrets old,
Of hidden treasures, legends told.

In the dappled light, shadows play,
Inviting wanderers to stray.
The forest breathes, a living song,
In its arms, I feel I belong.


- Oda Ndukkor
