Nature’s rhythm pulses,
a heartbeat felt in every blade, every petal,
a reminder that we are all intertwined,
each moment a note in the symphony.

When we walk among the trees,
minding our steps,
each touch a conversation,
a connection that lingers,
a dance of the divine.

We are the stories told,
the whispers in the wind,
a celebration of existence,
a reverence for the earth.

- Alejandra Zambra
