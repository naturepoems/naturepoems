A green wall rising just between,
  The woodland deep entwined,
  The flowers uhblue, the emerald scene,
  With skies that bloom behind.

A whisp'ring breeze without a care,
  Where mournful thoughts unmake,
  If every plant robbed me of its air,
  The breeze with peace would take.

- William Hazlitt
