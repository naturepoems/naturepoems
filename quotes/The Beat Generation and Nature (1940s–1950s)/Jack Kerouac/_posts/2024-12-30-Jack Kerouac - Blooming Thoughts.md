Blooming Thoughts

In the silence between breaths
comes a blooming of thoughts,
a wildflower bursting
through the cusp of sanity,
a vibrant noise in the chaos,
a reminder to chose life.

Every petal holds a secret
of resilience, of beauty,
of how to rise above,
how to sway as the winds
take flight, allowing
the heart to expand,
to embrace change
with all its colors.

So let us bloom, once more,
in the luminous spaces,
where sunlight kisses the earth,
where melodies live free,
as we find our way,
through the wilderness of the soul.
