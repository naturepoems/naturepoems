Morning Dew
Like diamonds fall the morning dew,
On blades of grass, on flowers bright;
Each droplet holds a world anew,
A prism caught in soft sunlight.

The waking birds begin to sing,
Their melodies, a soft caress;
In every note, the joy they bring
Unfolds the day with sweet finesse.

- Ilya Ehrenburg
