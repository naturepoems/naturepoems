Beneath the silver shimmer of the moon,  
The river weaves its gentle tale,  
Carving stone and silt with grace,  
And in its depths, the stars reflect,  
A mirror of the heavens above,  
Where dreams and water intertwine,  
With every ripple, a whispered love,  
Of nature's own enduring design.

- Ellen Ballance
