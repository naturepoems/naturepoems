Mountain Shadows

Majestic peaks that kiss the sky,
With clouds that swirl and drift on high,
In your presence, we find our dreams,
In every summit, the heart redeems.

Winding trails where eagles soar,
In nature's charm, we yearn for more,
The cool embrace of mountain air,
In every heartbeat, a sacred prayer.

With every climb, the soul ascends,
In whispered winds, the spirit mends,
For in your shadows, we find our light,
Nature’s guardians, fierce and bright.


- Anna Maria Møller
