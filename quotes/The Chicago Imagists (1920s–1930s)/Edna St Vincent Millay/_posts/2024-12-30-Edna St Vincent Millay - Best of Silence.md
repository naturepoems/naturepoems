And now this best of silence,—  
I hear the feathery song  
Come low upon the sea,  
And I wander as the drift  
Flies down the sweep of the land  
To listen for the tide,  
And swallow the distance;  
For each turning I will keep  
The salt kiss of this light  
Cling forever to me,  
In this rare of moments,  
Matching the shadow of clouds  
And stars past that shadow.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
