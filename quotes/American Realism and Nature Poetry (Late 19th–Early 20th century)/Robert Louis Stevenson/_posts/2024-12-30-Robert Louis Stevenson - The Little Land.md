The Little Land
Up in the sky the larks go high,  
       Over a piece of verdant sea,  
Bubbling slimy waters cry  
       On to shores I longed to see.

The grass is green, the leaves so bright,  
       The world is wrapped in shades of light,  
O little land, O little land,  
       I wish I may near you stand.

To dream your dreams and sing your songs,  
       Where peace and comfort always throng;  
To see the sun in amber rays,  
       While flowers paint their spring arrays.




- Robert Louis Stevenson
