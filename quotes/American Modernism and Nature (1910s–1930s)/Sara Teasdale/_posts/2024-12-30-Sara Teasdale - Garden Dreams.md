In a green garden of lilies,
I see the power of sunlight,
a captured magic held in petals,
wrapped in nature's subtle grace.

The dew that beads on each leaf
sparkles like treasures,
a girl’s laughter in the air,
a reminder of soft summer days.

The touch of wandering winds
brings whispers through the boughs,
carrying tales of the world,
from a hidden sanctuary of peace.

- Sara Teasdale
