The angel of the Lord came down,
And glory shone around;

Fear not! said he, for mighty dread
Had seized their troubled mind;

Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind.

To you in David's town this day
Is born of David's line

A Saviour, who is Christ the Lord;
And this shall be the sign:

The heavenly Babe you there shall find,
To human view displayed,

All meanly wrapped in swaddling bands,
And in a manger laid.

- Coventry Patmore
