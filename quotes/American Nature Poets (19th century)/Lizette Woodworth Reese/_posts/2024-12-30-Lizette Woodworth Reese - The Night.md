The Night

The night has fallen softly,
   Upon the quiet glade;
And the stars of silver twinkle,
   Where shadows gently fade.

The moon unveils her beauty,
   In a silver veil of light;
To bless the earth with dreams,
   That sail upon the night.

The whisper of the breezes,
   The rustle of the leaves,
Are lifeâ€™s sweet lullabies,
   Which stroke my heart like the eves.

O little stars above me,
   I seek your tranquil gleam;
For in this hushed, sweet moment,
   I walk within a dream.

- Lizette Woodworth Reese
