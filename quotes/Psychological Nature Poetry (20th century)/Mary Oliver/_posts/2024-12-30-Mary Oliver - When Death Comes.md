When Death Comes

When death comes
like the hungry bear in autumn;
when death comes and takes all the bright coins
from his coat and draws them in his pocket,
I want to step through the door full of curiosity,
wondering what this is,
and I want to exclude all the other places
I could be.
I want to be near the trees of the world,
the thunder that echoes from the mountains,
the creaking of myfootsteps in the forest,
the wind that shifts the clouds.
Oh no, I am not afraid of death,
but my mind wanders.
Let me go gently,
with the knowing of the world lifted
from my shoulder to your lips.
When death comes
like the hungry bear in autumn...

- Mary Oliver
