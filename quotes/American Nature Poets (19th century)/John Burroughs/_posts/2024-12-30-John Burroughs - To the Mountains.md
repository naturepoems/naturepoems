To the Mountains

Grandeur of rocky height,
Fleecy clouds of morning bright,
Glistening on the mountain's crown,
Heaven and earth with blessings drown.

Yet, not in distance lies the grace;
'Tis in the valley, in the space
Where winds weave tales of purity,
And whispers tell the mystery.

The grass lifts its emerald head;
The wildflowers' blush, the stream's cool bed,
All seek the sun and air's delight,
In nature's glow where worlds ignite.

- John Burroughs
