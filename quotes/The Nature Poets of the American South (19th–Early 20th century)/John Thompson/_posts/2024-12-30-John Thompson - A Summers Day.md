A Summer's Day

With laughter and light,
The warm sun does play,
Where the wildflowers bloom,
On a bright summer's day.

The bees hum their tune,
As they dance from the rose,
While the world wraps in green,
And each moment glows.

Oh day, sweet summer,
In your golden embrace,
Life bursts forth in color,
In this magical space.

- John Thompson
