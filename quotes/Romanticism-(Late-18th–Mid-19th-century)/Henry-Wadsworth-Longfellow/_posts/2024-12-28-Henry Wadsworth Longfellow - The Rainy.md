The Rainy Day
By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

The day is cold, and dark and dreary; 
It rains, and the wind is never weary; 
The vine still clings to the wall, 
But at every gust the dead leaves fall, 
And the sky is overcast.

The day is cold, and dark and dreary; 
         The rain is falling fast.  
O better than toil in its endless light,  
The tranquil valley, veiled in mist,  
And clouds that wander without fright.


I long for the sunshine of summer,  
And the blooming flowers, and the singing bird,  
But nature has her own melody heard;  
While trees, cast in shadows, wait with glee,
For the light that shall scatter darkness o'er me;  
Oh, when shall the sunlight glimmer?
