Sestina

September rain falls on the house.
In the failing light, the old grandmother
sits in the corner, beside the child,
beside the child.  Each evening she
leans in with her fingers, stroking the linen
and she counts it, feeling the balance,
crants in and out,
remembering the places she once held, and
this time, again and again,
the quick weft of family and fauna
will fall into place,
as the page bounds out
to touch the silence.
