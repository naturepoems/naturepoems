Autumn
The woods are turning brown and gold,
The chill of autumn in the air;
The nights grow long, the days grow cold,
Yet still the trees their bounty share.
In every gust of wind that blows,
A harvest whispers, soft and clear;
And still the beauty blooms and glows,
As nature bids the year good cheer.

- Hartley Coleridge
