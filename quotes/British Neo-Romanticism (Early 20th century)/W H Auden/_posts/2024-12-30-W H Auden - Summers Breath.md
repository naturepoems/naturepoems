In memory of a summer's breeze,
Through fields of green and golden light,
Where every moment seems to tease
With promises of endless delight.

The trees stand strong, as time goes by,
Their leaves whisper tales from days of old;
And nature's beauty draws a sigh,
A canvas rich, a story told.


- W H Auden
