In the arched embrace of the ancient trees,
Whispers of the forest speak soft and low,
Leaves rustle gently, like a sigh in the breeze,
A sanctuary where the wildflowers grow.

The earth hums beneath the pounding of feet,
Crickets serenade as twilight descends,
In the wild, lost echoes cradle the sweet,
In the heart of the woods, where forever transcends.

- Andrejs Panteļeevs
