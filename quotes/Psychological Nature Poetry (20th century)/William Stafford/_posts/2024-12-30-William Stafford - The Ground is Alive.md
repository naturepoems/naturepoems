You can tell the ground is alive,
  for even the frozen soil
       vibrates with life.
The gnarled roots of trees
  weave their stories below,
     stretching wide, finding
      water in the darkness,
          a map of survival.

And above, the branches sway,
     speaking with the wind,
   slow secrets shared between leaves.
To be still outside—
 Kissing the flowers,
  leaves ruffle lightly—
   this, to awaken.


- William Stafford
