The Starlight Night

Look at the stars! look, look up at the skies!
  O look at the sky! O, the sky with its houses
  The wind and the clouds, dancing in pairs!

Their pillows are made of the softest spears,
  With beds of gilded dust.
  So up and away theyâ€™re lifted,
  To where the celestial spirit stirs and sings,

Material eyes see a flying architecture.
  Those overhead where the broad-winged angels play;
  What love, great love, is in the cosmos!  No disdain.

So let your eyes be still, reflect it all:
  That light's pure blessings fall.
  Embrace what recounts, believe! Let your heart be free.

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
