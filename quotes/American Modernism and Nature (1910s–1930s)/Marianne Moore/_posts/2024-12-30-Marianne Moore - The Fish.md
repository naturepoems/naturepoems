The Fish

I caught a huge fish


It was a hard blow,

To my knuckles and


My face was covered,

With salt and scales,


I did not assume

   That I could take

The fish off the hook.


Finally, I slipped 

From the actuality,


Of suffering, it flopped

And fell back into


The waves, shimmering


In the sun’s light.


I did not attempt to catch


It again.


- Marianne Moore
