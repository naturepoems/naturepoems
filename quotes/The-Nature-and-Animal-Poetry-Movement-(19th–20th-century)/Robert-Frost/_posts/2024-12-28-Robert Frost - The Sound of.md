The Sound of Trees
I wonder if anyone would ever see
The sound of trees, with a soft, warbling plea,
To mix themselves with the shadows upon
The ground.

No one can complain of such a peculiar thing,
But the trees say, let our lives still spring
From what we hear in the sound of noise,
The joy this offers to silent poise.

Hear the hush, now, as the trees begin—
Let us come together then,
Along our way, we don't forget
The world has beauty, but the trees, they fret.

There is something soothing in their song,
A delicate whisper that says we belong.

The leaves cascade and dance in delight,
A gentle murmur that colors the night.

- Robert Frost
