O, the woods are full of melodies,
The wind, that stirs the trembling leaves,
Is but a voice that speaks to these,
And all the beauty this world weaves.

From dawn till dusk, the worldâ€™s a song,
Where every brook and flower belong,
Unwritten lines in nature's prose,
The breath of life where beauty flows.


- F W Harvey
