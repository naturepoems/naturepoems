To Penshurst
Thou art the garden of the flowing streams,
The many shades where nature loves to dwell,
With gentle whispers, echoing with dreams,
In every leaf and flower, each sound a spell.

Those groves that shield the quiet paths of time,
A sanctuary where the heart can rest,
In every beauty, cherished, pure, and prime,
The breath of life in thy fair soil is blessed.

O, to behold the creatures in their flight,
The humble doe, the lark upon the wing,
In natureâ€™s arms, the world unfolds its might,
To see what joy great weavers of love bring.

- Ben Jonson
