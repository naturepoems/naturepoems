A Toccata of Galuppi's  
...  
Thy flowers have the soft white hue,  
The lark's singing echoes too;  
And where once they blew,  
A lingering sound of past adieu  
Calls me back to the view;  

Where your art like the breeze  
Plays on heaven's face with ease;  
A necessary release—  
For what is more than just this peace?

- Robert Browning
