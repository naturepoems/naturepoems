Skyward, the mountains rise, 
a timeless fortress standing guard, 
each peak a proclamation, 
a tribute to earth’s embrace— 
a conversation between the timeless and the fleeting.

Clouds drift lazily, 
a whispered secret amongst  
majestic heights—an intimacy, 
a connection to the stars.

- Gino Severini
