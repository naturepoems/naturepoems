A Winter Night

The moon is a silver coin
  Tossed in a purple sky;
Stars like far-off lanterns shine
  Where the cold winds sigh.

Hushed are the trees, and the snow lies deep,
  All nature lies asleep;
The hoar frost weaves its silken net,
  And memories own the night.

Lone is the star that falls from its height—
  Each has its mysteries deep;
But dreams shall come on a winter night,
  When the world lies still in sleep!

- Isabella Valancy Crawford
