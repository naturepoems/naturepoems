To the River Arrow
O pleasant river, to whose gentle stream
I venture all my thoughts, and all my dream!
Your silver waters do my heart enclose,
As full of joy, and still as soft as prose.

O how you glide with subtle grace and ease,
Through marshy banks that tremble with the breeze,
Unfurl your waves, and wave to all who seek
Your tranquil shores, your landscape mild and meek.

Through verdant meads, and fields of golden grain,
O Arrow, roll or falter not in vain!
The birds that sing, the beasts that stroll nearby,
In harmony with you, their whispers sigh.

As evenings settle softly down on earth,
In twilightâ€™s balm they cradle all their mirth,
And you, dear stream, will ever weave my song,
As long as life and hope shall journey on!


- Michael Drayton
