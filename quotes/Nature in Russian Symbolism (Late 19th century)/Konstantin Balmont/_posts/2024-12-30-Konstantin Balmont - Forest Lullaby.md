In the forest where shadows linger,
  The nightingales begin to sing,
  The soft whispers of the moonlight
  Kiss the leaves and everything.
  
  Every star a distant dreamer,
  Every brook a flowing thought,
  Nature speaks in quiet verses,
  Giving gifts that can't be bought.

- Konstantin Balmont
