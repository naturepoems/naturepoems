The Acacia

   In acacias, the flowers bloom,
   light and laughter entwined,
   the fragrance lifts, stretches far,
   a scent of innocence within the air,
   and in all the world, something early awakens,
   synthetic in the warmth.

   They beckon forth to sweetness, glisten,
   and the sun finds mirthful inches of play,
   twirling the soft familiar echoes
   for all the dreams uncurled.


- D H Lawrence
