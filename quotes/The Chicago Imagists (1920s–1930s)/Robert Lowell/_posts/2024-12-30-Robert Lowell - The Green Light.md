The Green Light
by Robert Lowell

It was in the North, Barbara said,  
I was much farther than I had to go.  
I was in the dark depths where  
lungfish play and at sunrise  
where the pond meets the river  
it's yellow, bending branches grow.

Across the hills a flickering  
white light called the rain-cloud back.  
What crawled from the deep ended  
too late, I could not touch;  
I turned to the sun and the shimmer  
of hills where it hung.

The shades deepen in that dim  
darkness;  
you can feel the seeds rise up  
when the threadbare comfort of  
thoughts is still the same.

- Robert Lowell
