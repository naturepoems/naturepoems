The Blue Jay
I watched a blue jay
on the white cedar’s
branch, its wings,
a mere brush of feathers
above the meadows,
cutting a bright line.
It was not afraid of me,
perhaps it knew all was well,
that I speak in colors,
in a way all creatures
can sense, can feel,
can know.
The blue jay gives a signal,
that I am here,
in plenty; that in a moment,
as the sun glances above,
it sings out its joy,
loud and clear.
Every noise an invitation,
come to me! come to me! 
Hold only your breath,
for what can be heard remains.
Here lies the sky,
and I’m below,
with breakfast on the wing,
let me fly gently into this day.

— Mary Oliver
