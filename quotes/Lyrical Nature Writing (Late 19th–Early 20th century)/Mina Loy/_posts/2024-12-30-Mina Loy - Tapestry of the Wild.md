The wilderness invites,
It calls to us with scented breath,
Foliage curls like arms around
Both lovers and dreams alike.
What if we surrendered to the wild,
To the cacophony of unmarked paths,
Where trees rise in ancient royalty?
Here: falling leaves and whispered cries,
Branches arching toward unfathomable skies—
Where we tangle in their cadence,
We shall find our canvas,
Brush-stroked by nature’s hand alone,
In a tapestry known only in hearts.

- Mina Loy
