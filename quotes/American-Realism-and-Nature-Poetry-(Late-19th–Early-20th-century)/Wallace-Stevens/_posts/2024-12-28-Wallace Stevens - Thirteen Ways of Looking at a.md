Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird

I
Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.

II
I was of three minds,
Like a tree
In which there are three blackbirds.

III
The blackbird whistling
Or just after.

IV
He rode over Connecticut
In a glass coach.

V
The river flowed past,
The blackbird
Sang its song.

VI
O thin men of Haddam,
Why do you imagine
Golden birds?

VII
Do you not see how
The blackbird
Is singing in every tree?

VIII
I am in love
With the colors
Of the blackbird.

IX
When the blackbird flew out of sight,
It marked the edge
Of one of many circles.

X
At the sight
Of the blackbird
The tree is just a tree.

XI
The blackbird's song
Called out the echoes
Of nature itself.

XII
I know and will never know
Which way the blackbird went,
But the blue sky is present.

XIII
I can feel the blackbird's presence
As it moves across
The stillness of the afternoon.
