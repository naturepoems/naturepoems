A Happy Moment

Oh, a happy moment!—the sun is bright,
   And the breeze is breathing sweet—
The blooming flowers, with their sweet delight,
   Are joyful at my feet.
Here in the fields, away from cares,
   I find a lasting peace,
And I breathe in deeply, the fragrant airs—
   Oh, let my troubles cease!

- John Burroughs
