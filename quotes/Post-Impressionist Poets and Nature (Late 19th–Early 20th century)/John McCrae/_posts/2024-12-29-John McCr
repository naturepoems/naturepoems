A Mother’s Song

Child of the forest, child of the air,
When the sun rises bright and clear,
When the gentle breezes do call you out there,
Know that your mother is near.

To the fields of the daisies, to the rivers so wide,
To the spaces where sunlight will dance,
Remember her spirit, her love as your guide,
And let your heart join in the chance.

In the laughter of children, in the play of the leaves,
In the shimmer of stars up above,
In the world that surrounds you, believe and receive,
The essence of nature and love.

- John McCrae
