Forest Hymn

O sacred hour! O sacred grove!  
O influenced by the softest dove;  
Where the pine-trees incline to reign,  
Nature’s voice swells a sweet refrain.

Let us in silence love and live,  
And in the lap of peace forgiv',  
The heavenly notes of joy that sing,  
Beneath the boughs of every spring.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
