Ode to the Forest

Oh, ancient forest, shrouded in green,
Your secrets whispered by the trees,
Each branch a story yet unseen,
Dreams flutter like leaves in the breeze.

Rays of sunlight pierce the canopy high,
Dancing shadows on the forest floor,
While the soft rustle of wildlife's sigh,
Echoes in lonesome whispers ever more.

Time stands still in your nurturing arms,
Where weary souls seek refuge and peace,
In the embrace of your tranquil charms,
Their burdens wash away, their fears cease.

Oh, guardian of all that lives and breathes,
In your presence, life is renewed,
The pulse of nature, a heart that weaves,
A tapestry of beauty, forever viewed.

â€“ Nikolai Gumilyov
