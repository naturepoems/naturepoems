Amidst the flowers by the brook,  
a tapestry of colors bloom,  
the wild rose and clover dance,  
a ballet under the sun's embrace.  

Here, nature's pulse is felt  
in every flutter and rustle,  
reminding us of our roots,  
of the earth's invitation  
to join the circle of life,  
as we drink from its well of wisdom.

- Velimir Khlebnikov
