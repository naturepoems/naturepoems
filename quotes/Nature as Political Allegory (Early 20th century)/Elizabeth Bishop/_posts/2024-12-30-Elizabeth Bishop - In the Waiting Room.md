In the Waiting Room

In Worcester, Massachusetts, 
I went into a barbershop, and the woman
was putting a sign out, a purple sign, 
that said: Open for Business.

I was feeling
for the feeling that was in you like
something stored—as if it were 
a half-grown child. And all the men watched me.

A world that seemed so small—like 
a map—the ribbon of ocean between 
the lighthouse and the city; 
I thought even about the weather.

Outside, they were great—the size of 
a fish and a whale; they called the fish
with a whistle that was thunder but sound that was
almost impossible in the air,
among the rocks.

Then I walked inside, and all of this
frightened me. I didn’t hear only
what I was hearing, long before
it seemed to happen, and I waited for it to be true.
The trees were starting into bloom; 
the clouds were falling. I stayed there.

I waited for them to change back—that other thing.
Some kind of spring must not have happened 
a long time ago. I thought it was outrageous, I thought 
it was something I wanted only to remember.

But outside, I saw it at last—thealarming world.
The woman had dropped the sign:
it fell into a puddle, and I heard it,
but I was absolutely sure 
it would change everything—
even the milkweed.
Out on the street, I could move again.

And as the finishing touch
to a hair-cut, I concluded with an air; 
I walked away, aware of the sky’s great rise, 
almost vibrating in the balloon of the sun.
And all that splendid history? 
Going back to all that water? 
I sat still and watched the men.

The world’s wide enough for people to drown in,
but their faces were all turned toward me,
or rather, toward a cloudy anniversary. 

Yes, she was absolutely sure it would change everything, 
even the milkweed. 
I know it was already dead,
that long day in autumn when I first saw it.
And when I came back, of crucial things
that have happened to me.
