Each flower a promise, each breeze a kiss;
O Nature, wrap your arms around my soul;
In thy embrace, I find my bliss;
Through woods and meadows, effortlessly whole.

These fields of gold, the sky’s endless blue,
In the gentle touch of sunlit grace;
Let my heart sing of love so true,
For Nature’s beauty is my sacred space.

- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
