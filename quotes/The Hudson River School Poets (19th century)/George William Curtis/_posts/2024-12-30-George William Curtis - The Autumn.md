The Autumn

In autumn’s grace, the leaves do fall, 
A dance of amber, gold, enthrall; 
The air is crisp with scents of wood, 
As nature wears her finest hood. 

The harvest yields in fields of rust, 
With hopes renewed, a heart must trust; 
The bounty speaks of seasons passed, 
While whispered dreams in silence last. 

The twilight lingers soft and sweet, 
As birds take flight to seek retreat; 
For in the chill, the earth must rest, 
Wrapped in the dreams that she possessed. 

O autumn, muse of dying flames, 
With beauty held in all your names; 
In every color, every hue— 
A tapestry you weave anew.

- George William Curtis
