Amidst the tides that rise and fall,
I stand where sea kisses the shore,
feet sinking in the soft sand,
heart woven in the rhythm of waves.

The sun spills gold,
cascading through fingers,
its warmth igniting drowsy shells
that whisper tales of the deep,
over and over again,
in a voice that echoes through time.

Here, solitude meets the horizon,
a meeting place of sky and water,
where dreams unfurl,
carried by the breath of the wind.

Each grain of sand,
each ripple of tide,
a universe unfolding, tending the soul,
as the seagulls dance overhead,
flights of freedom tracing paths,
a reminder of the flight we all seek.
