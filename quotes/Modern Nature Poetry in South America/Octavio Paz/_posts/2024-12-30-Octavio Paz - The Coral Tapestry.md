Among the coral reefs,
a world hides beneath,
flashes of color,
a silent dance of existence,
each creature plays its part,
a testament to lifeâ€™s diversity.

In the depths, mysteries linger,
a truth painted in strokes of patience,
reminding us always,
every thread in this vast tapestry
is vital to the whole.

- Octavio Paz
