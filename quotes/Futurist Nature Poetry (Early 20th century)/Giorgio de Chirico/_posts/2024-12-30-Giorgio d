Where waters meet the stones,
a wound that heals,
each ripple a secret
shared with the winds,
a sanctuary of tranquility.

The grass welcomes each footstep,
a carpet woven with whispers,
a foundation of peace,
a trace of natureâ€™s warmth,
where the heart finds solace,
each moment a thread
to bind us all together.

- Giorgio de Chirico
