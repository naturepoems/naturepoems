The periods of silence  
Of our evenings are continued  
By the ancient tree  
That now vests itself in white light  
And scatters the rain-pearled leaves.  

O ye woods, virgin and still,  
In your glassy ripples,
I shall found a happiness!  
The stars fall down like ripened grains  
And the river  
Hums a soft lullaby,  
So sweet,  
In flanks of silence.

- Salvatore Quasimodo
