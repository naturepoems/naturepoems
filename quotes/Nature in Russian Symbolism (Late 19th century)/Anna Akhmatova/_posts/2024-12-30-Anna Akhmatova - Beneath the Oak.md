Beneath the boughs of an ancient oak,
I feel the pulse of the earth’s heart beat,
Stories of ages echo through the leaves,
A testament to time’s eternal retreat.

Its roots stretch far, deep into the ground,
Holding secrets of the past it has known,
And as I sit in quiet reverie,
I find solace in the wisdom it’s shown.


- Anna Akhmatova
