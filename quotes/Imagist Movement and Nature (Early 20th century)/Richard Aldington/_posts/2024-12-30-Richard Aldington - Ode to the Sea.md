Ode to the Sea

O Sea, O Sea,
Of this pale
And hollow shore!

I cannot describe thee
For thou art a body,
Outspeaking and reflecting not
A single colored layer;
With a subtle, fearless uniting laughter.

Thou hast forgotten silently
My life — a rhythm,
A reed blowing in a light wind.

Thy blue-green waves,
That love
And bind my dreams,
Make recoiling ashes of
The torch-song.

O Sea, O Sea,
That fills my house,
That quickens me with
Bitter joy and sadness, —
Thou art my creature to drown.
And I am the sinking black fish
In thy bluer green,
I cannot escape thee!
I cannot escape thee!

- Richard Aldington
