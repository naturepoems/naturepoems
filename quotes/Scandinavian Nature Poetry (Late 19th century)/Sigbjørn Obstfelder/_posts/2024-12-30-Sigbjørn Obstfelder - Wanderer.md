I am a wanderer in an endless night,
A restless spirit lost in this vast world;
To the forest I turn, its silence my guide,
There, amidst the trees, my heart finds a voice.

The stars above shimmer, whispering secrets,
Mist weaves through branches, a soft, gentle breath.
Here, where the shadows dance in moonlight’s embrace,
I lose myself, yet find what truly lies within.

- Sigbjørn Obstfelder
