I saw a tree today,
A tree that has stood for years,
With roots deep in the ground,
Branches stretching toward the sky.

Its leaves rustled a song,
A quiet melody of time,
Each leaf a story of sunlight,
And here I stand,
A mere shadow in its shade.

How many seasons it has seen,
A witness to the rains and the sun,
To life beneath and above,
Yet its silent strength remains.

Here I ponder the life of trees,
Their wisdom flows like sap,
Grounded yet reaching,
Never ceasing to grow.

- Richard Wright
