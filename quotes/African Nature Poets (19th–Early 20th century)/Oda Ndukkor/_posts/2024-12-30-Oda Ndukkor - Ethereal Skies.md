Ethereal Skies
The heavens stretch, a vast domain,
With clouds that dance and skies that rain.
Stars shimmer with stories untold,
In their glow, wonders unfold.

The moonlight bathes the earth in grace,
Reflecting the beauty of this place.
In every twilight, a promise to keep,
Awakening dreams from their slumbering sleep.
