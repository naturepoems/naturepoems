The Crescent Moon

When the crescent moon shall grace the night, 
In glistening waves of heaven's might, 
And shadows cast on fields of light, 
Where every dream may take its flight.

The sky will sing with silver hues, 
Each star will dance with tales to choose, 
In twilight's glow, the heart renews, 
Like petals kissed by morning's dews.

Let time unfold its silent guide, 
As nature currents ebb and glide, 
In harmony, our souls abide, 
In moonlit paths, with love, we bide.

- James Elroy Flecker
