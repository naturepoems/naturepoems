The sky weeps with memories,
  Each tear a glistening jewel
  And I catch them, like fireflies,
  As they dance among the hills.
  The soft hum of nature sings
  And wraps me in its blanket,
  As I trace the lines of the earthâ€™s face,
  Searching for moments where
  I am whispering in tune with it all.

- Sylvia Plath
