The Passing of Arthur

And when the cry arose,
   The island called in vain for a leader -
For the Leader was slain,
   And the dread was a deadly call:
And they took him, with sighing love,
   And sorrow, yet without fear,
In the light within their eyes,
   For they knew he left them here.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
