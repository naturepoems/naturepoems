Nature and Man

The trees lift their arms to thee;
They sway and beckon so—
I feel all the earth is free,
In the shadow and the glow.

The river that runs, runs deep;
It fain would turn and pause,
To pause upon a dream,
As man, with nature, draws.

Let the sun shine bright,
Through the leafy boughs above,
The spirit of nature speaks,
In the language of love!

- Elizabeth Palmer Peabody
