Beneath Blue Skies

From the edges of the horizon,
beneath blue skies,
a canvas wide and free,
fields of grass sway
gently in the cool breeze.
Every stalk bends low
like whispers,
mirroring thoughts,
a stretch of serenity,
tangible and bright,
under the vastness
revealing the world
so full of color and light.
