Spring Night

The night is soft as a bird's wing;
The moon in a sky that is crystal-clear
Is a pulse of light that sweeps and sings—
I am glad, glad here.

The wind whispers secrets in a tune,
The flowers bend low and sway easily;
It is a moment where the world stops,
And I can dream peacefully.

- Sara Teasdale
