The Nightingale

Upon the tree, the nightingale,
Sings songs of love both faint and pale;
Her notes cascade like silver streams,
In nighttime's embrace, I drift in dreams.

With every tune that graces light,
I feel the heart's soft, sweet delight;
For in the woods, her voice shall stay,
To greet the stars and guide the way.

- Thomas Woolner
