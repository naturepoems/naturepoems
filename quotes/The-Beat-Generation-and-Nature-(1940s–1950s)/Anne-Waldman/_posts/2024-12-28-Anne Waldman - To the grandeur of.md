To the grandeur of mountains
I give my voice,
Gristled cliffs,
beneath starry skies,
Dreaming in moonlight,
Splintered willows,
nature’s spine.

Oceans reached with laughter,
spouted wonder.
The limitless moisture,
in every droplet,
shattering silence,
the music of the waves.

In this beauty,
a calling, a tribute.
I weave the words,
into the fabric of the while,
a tapestry of movement
under watercolors
of dusk and dawn.

- Anne Waldman
