The Dying Bird

Upon the bough a bird, so fair,  
Sings not, for death looms near;  
With quivering wing, and fading air,  
It bids farewell, its heart sincere.

The morning dew drops from the leaves,  
As summer’s warmth begins to wane;  
In nature’s lap, the spirit grieves,  
As silence falls, a soft refrain.

Yet in its whispered song of sorrow,  
Glows a promise to return,  
In every heart that finds tomorrow,  
The echo of what dared to burn.

- Lydia Sigourney
