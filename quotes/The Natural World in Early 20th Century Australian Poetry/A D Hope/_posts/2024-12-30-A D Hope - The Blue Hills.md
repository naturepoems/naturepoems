The Blue Hills
Far off, the blue hills rise and sway,  
Where dreams dissolve in foggy gray,  
They shimmer soft with morning's breath,  
And guard the land both life and death.

Each shadow layered, laced with light,  
An echo sings the song of night:  
A quiet voice, a solemn tune,  
A joy that flows beneath the moon.

So stand before these towering peaks,  
Where air is light, and silence speaks,  
And listen where the wild winds play,  
To steal your breath, then fade away.
