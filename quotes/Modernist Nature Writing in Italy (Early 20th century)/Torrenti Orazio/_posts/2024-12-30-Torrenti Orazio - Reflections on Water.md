Reflections on Water

Still as glass, the lake reflects,
The sky’s soft blues and cloud’s white drifts,
In silent reverie, it holds the world,
A mirror to the ethereal shifts.

Beneath its surface, shadows dance,
The darting fish, the playful breeze,
Each gentle ripple tells a tale,
Of life, of love, of timeless ease.

As leaves fall, they join the stream,
A fleeting moment, a whispered sigh,
And as they sink, they find their peace,
In water’s cradle, forever nigh.

- Torrenti Orazio
