Under the blazes
Of the sun
The rivers leave the hills
No one has taught them
How to turn, how to double back,
Or cross once again
Into the valleys
They streamed from.

The gray hills listen.
They know the twinkle of their own
Pale flickers in the night,
And the sun that dances
Over all the seasons, all is bright.

Bright still is the river,
As it comes onward, onward,
Until the twist of its curling
Fingers shape the land anew.

- Carl Sandburg
