A deep silence rules over the high woods,
Rich with the souls of the ancient floods.
The rustling echoes must know my love,
Where bright birds sing from the nest above,
As twilight beckons with colors so grand,
Waves of thought inked by a gentle hand,
Fading into dusk, memories aren’t far,
Starlight’s embrace is never bizarre.

- Arthur Rimbaud
