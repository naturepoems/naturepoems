The gentle rustle of the willows,
  The chirping crickets fill the air,
  The twilight wraps the world in stillness,
  While fireflies dance without a care.
  
  Oh, how the night blooms in its splendor,
  With every shadow, every light,
  As nature joins the silent chorus,
  A symphony of starry night.

- Konstantin Balmont
