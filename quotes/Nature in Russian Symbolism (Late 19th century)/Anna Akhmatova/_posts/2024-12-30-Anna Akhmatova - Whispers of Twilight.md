The whisper of the wind through the pines,
The hush of a world in twilightâ€™s glow,
Calls to the wanderer deep in my soul,
Found in the heart of the wild's gentle flow.

The essence of life that stirs in the shadows,
Threads through the day and slips into night,
Nature, in all her splendid glory,
Cradles my dreams in her softly spun light.


- Anna Akhmatova
