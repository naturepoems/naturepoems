The Sun
by Gregory Corso

The sun is a rebel,
a hero swinging higher
than all thoughts,
it intoxicates,
udges the day from sleep,
caresses the air
with a smile.

It wears the economy of gold,
that flaunts itself,
balso magnificent,
spitting fire and radiance,
like a boy with a trumpet;
this is the pulse of what we know,
the wildness of existence
in the primal scream.

The sun burns with certainty,
feeding flame to the hungry,
lighting paths of wanderers,
as it spreads through
blue horizons!
Originally a gaseous thought,
it now thrusts forward
to unzip the night,
rooting in the ground of dreams,
This is not a tree,
not a decay, it’s life mixing,
a wild heat that matters.

- Gregory Corso
