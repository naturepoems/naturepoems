The Gift Outright
The land was ours before we were the land's.
She was our land more than a hundred years
Before we were, when people of the land
Were locked within her granite hills and seas.

We were here for one moment in the arc
Of time we climb toward the end of life.
In her great arms we found the truth of love,
That lasting truth that comes from knowing more.

O potent wonder — this earth, so perfect —
Which God created, yet did not choose.
Yet we are part of it: this land is us.

In that ancient spirit which is common to all,
Each man and woman — drawn in eternal loss
To laughter, joy—and hope that is indivisible!
For we are part of all the earth!

- Robert Frost
