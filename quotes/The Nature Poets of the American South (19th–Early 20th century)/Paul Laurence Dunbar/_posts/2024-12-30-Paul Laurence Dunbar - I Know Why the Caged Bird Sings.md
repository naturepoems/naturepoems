I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings

The caged bird sings
with a fearful trill,
of things unknown
but longed for still
and his tune is heard
on the distant hill
for the caged bird
sings of freedom.

The free bird thinks of another breeze
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright sky;
he names the sky his own.

But the caged bird sings
with a fearful trill,
of things unknown
but longed for still
and his tune is heard
on the distant hill
for the caged bird
sings of freedom.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
