The Starry Night

Beneath the vast, unending dome,  
The stars like diamonds softly gleam;  
In nature’s cradle, far from home,  
We drift away upon a dream.  

Each twinkling light a wish we cast,  
In silent hopes, our souls take flight;  
The universe a web so vast,  
Where hearts connect in purest night.
