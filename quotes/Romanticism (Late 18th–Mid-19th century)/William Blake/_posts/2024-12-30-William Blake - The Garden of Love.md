The Garden of Love

I went to the Garden of Love,  
And saw what I never had seen:  
A Chapel was built in the midst,  
Where I used to play on the green.

And the gates of this Chapel were shut,  
And Thou shalt not writ over the door;  
So I turned to the Garden of Love  
That so many sweet flowers bore,

And I saw it was filled with graves,  
And tombstones where flowers should be:  
And Priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,  
And binding with briars my joys & desires.


- William Blake
