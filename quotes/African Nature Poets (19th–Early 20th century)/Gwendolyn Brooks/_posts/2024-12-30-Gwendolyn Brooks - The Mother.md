The Mother

You were born, you were born,
For my love. You were born,
To replace a fading love,
To cool one burning heart:

O, you were born for my love.
For my wandering heart of sorrow.
You were born, like a long dark day,
For my day to turn around, O baby.

You were born to be,
Like the night light of my shades
For the cradle of the stars,
That opened into the universe.

You were born to go back,
From the pain of being different, baby.
You, my child, my child who was

a love of my life to consider my night.
O, you were born for my love.

Born to make my world,
Shine with a flame ignited at its heart.

- Gwendolyn Brooks
