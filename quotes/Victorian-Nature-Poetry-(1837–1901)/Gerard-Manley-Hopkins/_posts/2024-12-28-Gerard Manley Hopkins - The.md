The Windhover
I caught this morning morning's minion, king-
  dom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding
    Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding
   High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing
   In his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,
    As a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend; the hurl and gliding
Of the hurling's height, it was a trail of flames,
  A rich gaiety of shadow would bring,  
Him, the daring of the dove and its pens.

--  Gerard Manley Hopkins
