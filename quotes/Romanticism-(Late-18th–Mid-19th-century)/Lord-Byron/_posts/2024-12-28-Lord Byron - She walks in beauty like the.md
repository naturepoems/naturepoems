She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.

And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles, the tints of youth, allow,
Like a night of cloudless climes and starry skies;
While the whole world was stilled, I was lost,
For thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.

Thus mellowed to that tender light,
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

- Lord Byron
