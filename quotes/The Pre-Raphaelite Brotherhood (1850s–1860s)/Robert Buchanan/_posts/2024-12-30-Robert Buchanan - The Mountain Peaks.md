The Mountain Peaks

I.
 Lofty mountains greet the sky,
Where the eagles dare to fly;
Whispers of the ages call,
Stronger than the dewdrops fall.

II.
Firm roots of the granite bold,
Hold the secrets yet untold;
Each crag that breaks the sunlight glow,
Harbors tales of  long ago.

III.
So let me wander, with my heart,
To where the echoes do not part;
Beneath the stars, where dreams convene,
I find the ancient wood, serene.

- Robert Buchanan
