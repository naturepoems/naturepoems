The Morning Dew

Upon the grass, the dew drops lie,  
As jewels bask in dawn’s embrace;  
A fleeting moment, time goes by,  
Yet holds the world in tender grace.

The sun awakens, casts its glow,  
And kisses each drop, pure and bright;  
In this soft warmth, my worries go,  
As nature gleams in morning light.

O Morning Dew! You teach anew,  
The beauty found in fleeting time;  
In every drop, a life imbued,  
In nature’s hand, my heart will climb.

- Alphonse de Lamartine
