The wind blew high, the wind blew low,
Through the wood I took my way;
And there I met a bonnie lass,
Just at the break of day.

She said, ‘Come hither, come hither, love,
Oh, come and sit with me;’
For I’ll not be here all winter, love,
Nor spring, nor summer free.

‘But I will be to thee, dear maid,
While the sun shines bright and clear;
But if you love me, love me well,
Come, love, I’ll linger here.’

The wind flew high, the wind blew low;
And the trees were full of cheer;
When I left my dainty bonnie maid,
Just at the break of year.

- Robert Burns
