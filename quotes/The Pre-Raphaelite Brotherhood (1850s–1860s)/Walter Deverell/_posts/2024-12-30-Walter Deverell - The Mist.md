THE MIST

The mist lies low above the sleepy meadow,  
A veil of whispers soft and serene.  
Through phantom trees, the silver shadows grow,  
Where dreams of night fades into morning’s sheen.  
Awake to see a world wrapped in this screen—  
Yet hints of color start to break apart,  
As sunlit rays, with tender touch, convene,  
To paint anew the landscape from the heart.


- Walter Deverell
