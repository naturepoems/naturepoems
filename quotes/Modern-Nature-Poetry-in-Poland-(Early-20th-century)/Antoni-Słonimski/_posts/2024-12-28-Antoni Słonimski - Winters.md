Winter’s Lament

Where once the rose, now frost does creep,
As silence cloaks the world in white,
The trees stand tall, in slumber deep,
As stars adorn the starry night.

A crystal blanket hugs the ground,
Nature whispers, hushed and still,
In winter’s grip, no harshness found,
A tranquil space, the heart can fill.

And when the warmth begins to glow,
When life returns to earth once more,
In spring’s embrace, a vibrant show,
We’ll bid adieu to winter’s lore.
