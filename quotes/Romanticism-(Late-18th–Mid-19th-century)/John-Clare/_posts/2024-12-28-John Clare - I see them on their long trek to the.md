I see them on their long trek to the wood—
The little things of nature, passing by;  
Through hedges thick and thickening, whence they’ll flutter,  
Where bluebells bloom and wildflowers grow nigh.

I hear their songs: the larks in flight do sing,
Their flutes and whistles play upon my ear,
While gentle winds send ripples through the leaves,  
The meadow is alive—it calls me near.

And in the distance, hills stand proud and true,
Their peaks with cloud and sun in sweet embrace;
The world is woven rich with green and hue,
Life whispering softly, in this sacred place.
