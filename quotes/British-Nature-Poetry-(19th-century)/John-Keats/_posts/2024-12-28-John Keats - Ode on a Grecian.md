Ode on a Grecian Urn:

Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,
Thou foster-child of Silence and slow Time,
Sylvan historian, who canst thus express
   A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:
What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape
   Of deities or mortals, or of both,
   In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
   What men or gods are these? What mad pursuit?
What struggle to escape? What pipes and timbrels?  
What wild ecstasy?

Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
   Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;
   Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,
   Pipe to the spirit doves, gentled 'neath the trees,
With the spring of life,
   Where the wild doves be sure to sing anew.

Love in a dream far sweeter far,
Than in the waking world we knowâ€”the sun,
Casts shades of splendor, in thy leaves, a song.
Lifted into them, heart-full of joy we flow,
Let their gentle songs in beauty play on.

- John Keats
