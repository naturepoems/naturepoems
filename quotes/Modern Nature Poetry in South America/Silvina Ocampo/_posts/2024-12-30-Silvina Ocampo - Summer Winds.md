Summer Winds

With the summer winds,
a rapture flows,
caressing the golden fields
that cradle the sunshine.
Every breath of air
a memory unfolding
a soft caress,
while the daisies bend
a lullaby serenades
the warmth drapes over,
a heavenly mantle,
no argument, no fatigue.
All is grace in this embrace.
