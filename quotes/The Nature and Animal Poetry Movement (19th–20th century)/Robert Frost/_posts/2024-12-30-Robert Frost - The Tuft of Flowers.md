The Tuft of Flowers
I went to turn the grass once more
And looked down with my hand upon the sickle bar.
There was a tuft of flowers beside the way
That I had to find again;
And was taken with them long enough to work
To think back all the way, compelling.

I seen that bright once like a festival
But now it grows and stands so tall.
I had to leave it, but I had come to think
It hailed half of this world away,
And, finding it at last, there’s beautiful yes,
I longed to go and dare to feel the sun.

In vain I stood alone in my dream
As past I dreamed but could not tell or find:
But found the growing trees that stand beside my head
Were now not kept too far to see from broken light.

I went to turn the grass once more
And it’s languishing now all in the air.
The shadows of this place only deepened my impulse
In days, that thought leaves me unaware.

- Robert Frost
