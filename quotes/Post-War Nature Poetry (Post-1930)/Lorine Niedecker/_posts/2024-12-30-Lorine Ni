Dusk

When the light begins to fade,
a hush settles upon the world,
x’s of shadow weave
the fabric of the night.

Here in the twilight’s glow,
every sound is amplified,
as the sky cloaks its golden dress,
a slow surrender
to the audacity of stars,
to that looming invitation
to dream,
to dance beneath the impossible sky.

This softness,
this promise of night,
i carry gently in my heart,
a glow of reverence for all,
for now, for what shall come,
for the cycle renewed.

- Lorine Niedecker
