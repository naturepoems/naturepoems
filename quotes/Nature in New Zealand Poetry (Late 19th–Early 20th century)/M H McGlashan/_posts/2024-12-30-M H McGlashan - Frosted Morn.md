Frosted Morn

A frosted morn, the world aglow,
  With diamonds on the grass;
The sun arrives to melt the snow,
  As shadows slowly pass.

The trees, adorned in pearly lace,
  Bow low beneath the weight;
A silent majesty of grace,
  This beauty feels like fate.

The crisp air bites, yet warms the heart,
  Each breath a cloud of white;
In winter’s chill, we find the art
  Of fleeting, pure delight.

So let me walk this frosted land,
  With wonder shining bright;
For in this moment, hand in hand,
  I bask in nature’s light.
