O read me— 
For this is the land of the day, the seas— 
And my face—are all under the sunlit sky—
All doom or destiny, I drink here—
I am in the hollow of the wild— 
the songs of the forest 
burst the shattered whistling woods,
Trickling down in silver notes,
As the green-vat swallows—
This sunlit airstream, through my veins—
Of nature I drink it
And feel the heartbeats of
The wild multiplying—
I gather here your gifts—
Through nakedness, 
Through the harde rate,
Of singing leaves—
That I may sing too in the shrine of the wild.
In you is a spirit—burning, 
And at last— 
I enter a quiet, cool temple— 
The forest,
You, wild river, filth covered,
Whose waters slip sideways—
Through my cracked hands I gather 
The sun, the green freshness 
In the tender light of fragile earth.

- Hilda Doolittle
