An Offering

White butterflies drift,
the fleeting moment of grace,
on a canvas of endless blue.
The world sings,
as the petals fall,
as the bees gather honey.

I offer my heart
to the earth,
to the beauty of existence,
a promise to carry on,
a promise of hope,
in this dance of seasons,
a rhythm of life.


- Czesław Miłosz
