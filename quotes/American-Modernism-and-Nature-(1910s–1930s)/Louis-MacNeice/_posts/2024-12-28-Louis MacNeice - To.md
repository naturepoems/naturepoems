To Autumn
  
  O autumn, in thy glory bright,  
  Thy colors gold and amber weave,  
  A tapestry of fading light,  
  That bids the summer’s grace, bereaved.

  Thy harvest yields so rich and strong,  
  In bounty that the earth unfolds,  
  A song of peace, a whispered throng,  
  In every field, in every fold.

- Louis MacNeice
