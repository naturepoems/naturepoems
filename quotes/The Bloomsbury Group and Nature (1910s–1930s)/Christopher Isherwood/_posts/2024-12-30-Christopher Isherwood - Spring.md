Spring  
In the bloom of spring,  
When the air is plump  
With sweet pollen,  
I walk through the fields  
Where blossoms unfold.  
Petal soft, whispering  
To the breezes –  
For here life stirs,  
And somewhere far-off  
Voices of children  
Chime in laughter,  
A symphony with  
The cuckoo and the bee.  
I pause startled,  
For it is here I find  
A moment beyond  
The rush of the world -  
A tender heart  
In the embrace of peace.

- Christopher Isherwood
