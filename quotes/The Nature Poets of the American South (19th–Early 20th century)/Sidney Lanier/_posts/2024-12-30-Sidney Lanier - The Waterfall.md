The Waterfall
So sweet the sound of waters that intertwine,
  A foaming grace, in rhythm divine,
Where the sunlight twinkles in cascades bright,
  And the heart is lost in its sheer delight.

And see the joy of glistened streams,
  In all their rapture, and prayed-for dreams;
Like mystic voices from the heights herald,
  The soul of nature, untamed, unfurled.

- Sidney Lanier
