The Windhover

I caught this morning morning's minion, king-
  dom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding
    Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding
        High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing
    In his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,
  As a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding
    Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding
        Stirs for a bird—, the achieve of, the mastering of the thing.

    Brute beauty and valour of heaven and earth,
  Boldness from a soul. THE FIRES:
    Watch, highest of birds, joy,
        Air, air, is all part of what I can.     
  I rise with air. Morning is fell, what of this?

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
