The river twined with silver strands,  
Reflects the gentle moonlit night;  
Upon the banks of verdant lands,  
The stars above in softest light.  
The echoes dance in narrow space,  
With hearts attuned to nature's calls;  
In every shadow, every place,  
A haunting beauty gently sprawls.  


- William Holman Hunt
