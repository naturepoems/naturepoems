The grass is a great blush of green, 
The woods are in their prime,  
The flowers droop with the dappled sheen, 
And the spring is in its chime.  
The songbird's note is the forest's shroud, 
As nimble as the fall of snow,  
Under a canopy thick and proud,  
Where the wild wind does blow.

- John Burroughs
