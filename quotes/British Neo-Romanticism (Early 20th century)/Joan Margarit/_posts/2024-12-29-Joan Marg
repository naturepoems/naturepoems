The sunset blushes against the horizon,
   Flames licking at the day’s end,
A cascade of colors spilling—
   A final curtain call for the sun.
I stand, enchanted, absorbing the glow,
   Each moment a fleeting memory—
The sky dons its evening dress,
   A promise of night, of dreams to unfurl.

- Joan Margarit
