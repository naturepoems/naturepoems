The lads in their youth, they go to the green,  
Oh, what do they see in the fields divine?  
They sing to the shades of trees ever serene,  
And drink to the rivers, the sun, and the brine.

With laughter they chase the butterflies bright,  
And whisper sweet dreams to the stars above;  
In natureâ€™s embrace, they find pure delight,  
And wander in splendor, unburdened by love.

- A E Housman
