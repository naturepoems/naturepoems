A Starry Night

Beneath the embroidered sky,
Where the stars breathe in delight,
A canvas of stories spun high,
In the vastness of endless night.

Each shimmer a promise of hope,
A flicker from the celestial gate,
While dreams like ships learn to cope,
Navigating the currents of fate.

- Gustave Kahn
