In the garden, petals unfurl,
Bees humming softly as they twirl.
Every blossom, a delicate sigh,
Nature's perfume, a sweet goodbye.

The dusk wraps around like a soft shawl,
Crickets chirp as the shadows fall.
In this moment, all is aligned,
The heartbeat of nature, perfectly timed.

- Mariano Fortuny
