Earthy Anecdote
I was made to know this,
That all that existed was forgotten
even in the morning's light.
That no matter how fresh,
it seemed and resolved at a glance,
there was nothing there but the heights of snow,
the black of trees against the glowing morn,
tears of the earth— and all of this,
which had been a brother to a breather.

And I can still know that 
silence lies and shapes it,
must subdue its wandering.

- Wallace Stevens
