The Sea
The sea is a thing of beauty,  
its waves rolling in,  
a dance in the moonlight.  
To the edge of the horizon,  
it promises enchantment and loss,  
an invitation to dream.  

Tides of fate pull at my heart,  
where shadows of ships drift  
into ghostly rhythms of sunset,  
while the landscape shifts  
under the eternal pulse of the tides.  

The salt in the air,  
like tears of bygone lovers,  
reminds me that this expanse of blue,  
though a canvas of peace,  
holds depths of sorrow.

- Ruth Padel
