To Whistler, American
Your heart aches 
That the love in which you might call
   The wind against the wall,  
Or lift the wrinkled leg of the air
   To see a much-fallen building,  
And, darkening in the sky; Good.
   These are small things,
          Become a shadow of desire
     For the one who is sacrificial.
The somber cloud at our feet,
        That thing which summons forth.
You shall love them more than
   The very light.

- Ezra Pound
