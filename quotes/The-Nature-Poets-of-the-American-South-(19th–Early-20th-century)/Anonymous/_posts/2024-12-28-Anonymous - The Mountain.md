The Mountain Top

Upon the mountain-top I stand
Where all the world below me lies;  
I hear the music of the land,  
And sunlit beauty fills the skies.  

The river’s song, the rustling leaves,  
The whispering wind, they call to me,  
A symphony that never leaves,  
In nature’s arms, forever free.
