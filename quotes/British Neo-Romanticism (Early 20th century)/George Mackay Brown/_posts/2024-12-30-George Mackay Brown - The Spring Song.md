The Spring Song

Awake, my heart, to the spring song ringing,
As blossoms swell in a riot of hues,
The earth hums beneath the gentle touch,
Of sun-soaked days and fragrant nights,
Where love is reborn in every tender leaf.

The brook bubbles with laughter anew,
Dancing on stones long-in-waiting,
While the sky, a canvas of blue and hope,
Overspreads the world with dreams of warmth,
In the embrace of lifeâ€™s perpetual dance.


- George Mackay Brown
