I love to see the wildflower spring,
To hear the songbirds in the morn’ do sing.
Each bud unfolds with a tender grace,
In every corner, life finds a place.

The gentle river winds through the land,
Eroding all things with a tender hand.
Her whispers hum a soft lullaby,
As she flows beneath the unfathomed sky.

The fragrance of moss, the touch of a breeze,
In nature’s embrace, I find my ease.
There’s magic in the cusp of each bloom,
Life’s fragile beauty dispels all gloom.
— John Clare
