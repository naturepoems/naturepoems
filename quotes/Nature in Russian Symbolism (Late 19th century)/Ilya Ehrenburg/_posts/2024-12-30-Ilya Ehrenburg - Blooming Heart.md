Blooming Heart
The flowers burst in colors bright,
A rainbow born from hidden roots;
Each petal tells of morning light,
Of natureâ€™s touch, of joy that shoots.

In gardens lush, where fragrances lie,
The heart finds solace, soft and sweet;
With every bloom, it learns to sigh,
And dance with life, in blissful beat.

- Ilya Ehrenburg
