The Sea

The sea rumbles its age-old stories,
Of tempest and calm, of ship and shore,
Each wave a verse upon the sands,
Worn smooth by the kiss of time alone,
As gulls dive, choreographers of the sky.

And in the salt air, I search for echoes,
Of those who’ve come before me,
The fishermen, the lovers, the dreamers,
All gazing at the horizon’s light,
Embracing the infinite possibilities of blue.


- George Mackay Brown
