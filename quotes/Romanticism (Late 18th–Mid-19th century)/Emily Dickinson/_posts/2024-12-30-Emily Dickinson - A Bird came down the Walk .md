A Bird, came down the Walk –  
He did not know I saw –  
He bit an Angleworm in halves  
And ate the fellow, raw.  

And then he drank a Dew  
From a convenient Grass –  
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall  
And scarce an inch from my face –  

And he unrolled his feathers  
And rowed them soft – like Boars –  
And just like him – I’d hurry   
For he has no deceit –  

But he seems no less than Nature  
And kicks the tall green Grass.  

For his hands, as sippers have –  
The Grass would let him pass –  

And I left him, when I saw  
This little Bird of his –  
I could not call him mine –  

He flew the way he lifted  
And left no trace at all –  

I have seen him further –  
Than anyone before –  
And I gave up my stay –  

Yet I would not be sorry  
Should he return again –  

For he came down the Walk –  
And surely heart’s in play –  

I, also, would not know  
Ere left him, but aside –  

So I turned, my way, as still  
As any Bird that flew –  

In this little piece of nature  
To speak of truth and play –  

It is enough for one, alone,  
But still – he passed my way.

- Emily Dickinson
