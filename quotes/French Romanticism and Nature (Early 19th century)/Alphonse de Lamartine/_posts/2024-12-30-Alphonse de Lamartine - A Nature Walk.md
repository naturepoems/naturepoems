A Nature Walk

Through verdant paths, where shadows play,  
And sunbeams weave a golden fray,  
I wander forth, my spirit free,  
In harmony with earth’s decree.

The rustling leaves, a whispered lore,  
In every step, I yearn for more;  
The melodies of insect choirs,  
Awake my heart, ignite my fires.

O Nature! Guide my humbled heart,  
To find in you, the purest art;  
For in your arms, I’m truly whole,  
The essence of my longing soul.

- Alphonse de Lamartine
