The Mountain

High on the hill, where the cloud-wreaths lie,  
And the winds that sweep with a mountain cry;  
In the heart of the rocks where the echoes meet;  
There the spirit soars, and my soul is fleet.

Where the granite towers with a solemn grace,  
And the rivers flow with a proud embrace;  
In the stillness of it — my dreams take flight,  
And my heart is filled with the sky’s delight.


- G L D Mackay
