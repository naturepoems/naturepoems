A Grave

In the cypress shadows a lapwing agonizes,
    bewildered by a rootless sky,
  in the bleached light remains scattered
     undulating visions of wisdom;
  while the marsh descends into flora,
    and the quiet whispers shake
      the frail paws of a tiara.
You find luck in the spires of light
    when settling down on the earth,
      a certain disinterest lying in the hollow,
        a gentle circle of sight that is disheveled
          alongside the creature with limp eyes,
            it only wants to linger long.


- Marianne Moore
