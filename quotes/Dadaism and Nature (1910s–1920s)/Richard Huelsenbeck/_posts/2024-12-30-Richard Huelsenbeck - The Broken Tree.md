The Broken Tree

A lonely old tree
With a scream stuck in its bark,
Hues of anguish display,
Beaten in the dark.
Leaves whisper forgotten secrets,
Roots tangled in dreams,
The moon casts a pallor,
Silencing the beams.

While other trees sway
In spring joy’s embrace,
This broken one stands,
Cast aside in disgrace.
Yet in its wild scars
Lies the history of storms,
A true testament alive—
A perennial form.


- Richard Huelsenbeck
