This is a poem about the moon:
Growing fainter,
In the flowered dark,
The moon; high below,
Distant, absinthe,
A curtain of shadows
Between thorns, the grid,
Of different nights.
Thunder echoes,
And the dew is borne,
Ay, until next time—
Rekindled clouds,
Strike briefly:
The moon relents in the mist and melts.

- Margaret Atwood
