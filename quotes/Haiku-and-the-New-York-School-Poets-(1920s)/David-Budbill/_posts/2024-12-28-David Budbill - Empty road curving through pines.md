quote: "Empty road curving through pines,  
Each step softened by fallen needles,  
Sunlight dapples the path,  
Footfalls fade into nature’s song,  
Harmony embraces my soul."

Empty road curving through pines,  
Each step softened by fallen needles,  
Sunlight dapples the path,  
Footfalls fade into nature’s song,  
Harmony embraces my soul.
