Spring and All
By the road to the contagious hospital
under the surge of the blue

mottled clouds, the green
mothors of the trees,

In the late spring
with the sun hereover

showing the starry flow,
over the blue, among
from the frozen weather,
ivory of the saxon roots,

swiftly into bloom;

No man can survive
this.  But look how.

They say that the flowers
are coming out of the schist,
but blue of the city
was for several this spring,
were many blue and yellow explosions,

and fields of green grass.

In the amethyst dusk
come poised, and poppies
in motion to people,
fragments from the blue sockets
of spring," and nothing growing,
but much to see,sounds around.

Spring and all around!


- William Carlos Williams
