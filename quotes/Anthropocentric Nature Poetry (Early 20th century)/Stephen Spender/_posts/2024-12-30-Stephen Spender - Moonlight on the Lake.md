The moon dances on the lake’s soft surface,
A silver coin dropped in a fountain of dreams,
And as I gaze into its embracing light,
Nature scatters its secrets, softly gleams.

Crickets sing beneath the opera of stars,
While the cool breeze carries whispers of night,
Suspended in air, the scent of the earth,
Makes me long for the day—where shallows meet depths.

Each ripple a blessing upon the waiting shore,
Reflects the dance of existence, endless and free,
And though I stand alone, quietly pondering,
In this vast web of life, I am part of the sea.
