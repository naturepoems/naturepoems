There is a magic in the earth  
That is a part of me –  
I feel it thrumming in my veins –  
As I walk through the Trees –  

In every flower and every blade,  
In every river flowing free –  
The Earth breathes life into my heart  
And sings her song with me –  

So let me wander where I will,  
And let me breathe the air –  
For every step I take in joy,  
Is here a prayer, and there a prayer –  

For Nature is my only Friend,  
And with her heart, I twine –  
In perfect harmony, our souls  
Will join in love divine –

- Emily Dickinson
