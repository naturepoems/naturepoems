Reflections in the Water

In the stillness of the lake’s embrace,
Where dreams are captured, shadows play,
I see reflections of a hidden face,
Whispers of night, in disarray.

The water shimmers, like a mirror,
Reflecting tales of love and grace,
With every ripple, the mind grows clearer,
Nature's breath in a gentle trace.

In solitude, my thoughts drift slow,
Carried by the currents of the heart,
As moonlight spills its silver glow,
In this tranquil world, I find my part.

Oh, sacred water, take my fears,
And hold them close in your gentle flow,
For in your depths, my spirit clears,
A tranquil peace, forever to know.

– Nikolai Gumilyov
