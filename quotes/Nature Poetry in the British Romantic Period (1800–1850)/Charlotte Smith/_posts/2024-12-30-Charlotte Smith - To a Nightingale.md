To a Nightingale,
   by Charlotte Smith

O bird of night! thy mystic song to me  
Brings sigh unheard, from depths of silence tried.  
Among the dales and hollow woods I see  
Thy tune resound where love and dreams abide.  

Rich foliage sways, while shadows fall and creep  
In silence; let thy sweetest notes arise;  
From bough to bough, thy whispers wake from sleep,  
As passions stir beneath a moonlit guise.  

Soft strains of love! Your tenderness I'll crave,  
Amid the bramble nooks and flowers, too;  
To every breeze! My heart will gladly save  
A bursting joy that blossoms, birth anew.

- Charlotte Smith
