Spring arrives unnoticed,
a slow emergence,
a soft touch on ice,
each bud bursts forth
in trembling laughter.

Fragrant prose of blooms	 
steal the heart of winter,
like the unfurling pages of a book
waiting to be read.

Every petal, a poem,
each fragrance, a story,
as nature pens her works
in colors so vivid,
reminding us of lifeâ€™s return.

- Margherita Guidacci
