The Swallow
The swallow sings in my heart  
A melody like bubbles fair,  
With wings that cut the sky apart  
In every breathless autumn air.
 
Each note it lends shall stir the blood  
Of joy that neâ€™er the heart can tire,  
As spring's warm sun brings life and flood  
To clasp the dusky world with fire.

- John Clare
