O rugged hills, your strength I see,  
A testament to time’s decree,  
You cradle the sky in your loving arms,  
A sanctuary rich with nature’s charms.

In the laughter of the wind, I hear,  
The stories of ages, each one clear,  
A symphony played by earth and sky,  
In the grand theater where spirits fly.

- Thomas Mofolo
