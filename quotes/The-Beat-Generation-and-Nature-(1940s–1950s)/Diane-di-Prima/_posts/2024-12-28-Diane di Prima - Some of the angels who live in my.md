Some of the angels who live in my head
fly their own way,
you might say, wild-lighted
by the sun's own rays,
or by the thing-ness of things itself,  
by what exists   
in the wild summer tree,  
heart of the heat,
that catches the soft and wild of days  
in wild bloom,
whoever hears, nature awash in jazzy
piercing verse.

— Diane di Prima
