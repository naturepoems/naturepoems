Nature is what we see—  
The Hill—the Afternoon—  
Squirrels—eddying—nestled  
In their Pageant  

The Falls—the Folded (in)  
The Bough—the Woods—  
The Sun—sensitive  
Upward to see—  

Afar—Afar  
The Blue—so bright  
The Ocean that is sinking  
Made a bed  

For the groves  
The Stalk—the Moss—  
The Bird unlike the Sun—  
Astonished—Joy’s genius  

Dew in each Gentleman  
The Nature we embrace—  
A Vale—  
An Angel—  

The Resplendent Day  
Not dark without  
That lingers for departure  
Before Eternity—  


- Emily Dickinson
