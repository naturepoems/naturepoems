Winter's Solace

When silent snow wraps all around,
And hush the world in crystal white,
Each flake a gem where peace is found,
In winter's cloak, the stars ignite.

The frosty air, a crisp embrace,
Invites us to reflect and wait,
In icy stillness, time slows pace,
A fleeting moment, calm and great.

Yet springs await beneath the frost,
In slumber deep, new life abounds,
For every season's gain or loss,
In nature’s heart, the truth resounds.

- Clara Wadel
