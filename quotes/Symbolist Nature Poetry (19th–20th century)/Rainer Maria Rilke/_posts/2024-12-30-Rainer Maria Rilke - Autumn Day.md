Autumn Day

Lord: it is time. The summer was immense.
Lay your long shadows on the sundials,
And in the flocks, let loose the winds.

Command the harvest to be full,
And grant us one more southern day,
Before the autumn days begin to sob.

Like shadows lift their faces in the sun,
Let us bring in the last of fruit and wine.
Let us gather our hearts in the hands
And keep them there till the first pale frost.

Bury our days in the soil of the sun,
The husk shall sprout and come alive,
For in the golden ripeness we shall find
The endlessness and depth beneath our eyes.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
