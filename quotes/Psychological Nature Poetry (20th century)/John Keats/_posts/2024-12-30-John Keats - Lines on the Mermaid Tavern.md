Lines on the Mermaid Tavern

An exquisite realm where men are wise,
And their laughter tumbles through the moonlit skies,
The sea lapping waves in a sweet refrain,
This nightâ€™s bright vision will enshrine a gain,
Among frivolous spirits, too wild to tame
A melting joy, that breathes your name.

       John Keats
