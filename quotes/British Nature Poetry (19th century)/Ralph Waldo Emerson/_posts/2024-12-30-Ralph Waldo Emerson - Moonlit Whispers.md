A whisper in the quiet night,
The moon casts silver, pure delight;
In darkness deep a glimmer glows,
A light that promises and knows.

Each star an eye that glimpses down,
Configuring the earthâ€™s soft crown;
In nature's realm, we find our home,
Upon this earth, forever roam.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
