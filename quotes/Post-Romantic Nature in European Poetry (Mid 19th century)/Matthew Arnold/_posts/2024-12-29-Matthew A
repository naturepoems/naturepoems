A New Year’s Night
   Through the light of the stars the winds shall sigh,
   Bright summer shall walk on the shores of time,
   Each flower shall ask: why 
   Such voiceless hours of rime
   To cushion our hearts from the sweet delight of the sky?—
   The last charm of its gentle flight shall be lost from me!

- Matthew Arnold
