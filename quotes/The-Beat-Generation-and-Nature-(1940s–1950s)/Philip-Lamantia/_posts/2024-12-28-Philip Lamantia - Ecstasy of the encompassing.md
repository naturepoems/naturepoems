Ecstasy of the encompassing pines,
Green and gold and hidden signs,
Whirls in the breath of the shifting sand,
Where secrets nestle in nature’s hand.

Cascades of laughter, the rivers betray,
As I wander the vastness, I dream away.
Each blade of grass, a whisper to be,
In the breeze, I find memory's key.


- Philip Lamantia
