Oh! the splendid delight in the heart of the vale,
Where the blossoms are swaying with the soft evening gale;
It’s a treasure to wander where the wild things are free,
In the dance of the sunlight through arbour and tree.

There’s a magic in twilight that the stars softly scribe,
And the shadows embrace as they gather and vibe,
For the night wears a mantle of dreams and of rest,
And the world wanders softly at nature’s behest.


- C J Dennis
