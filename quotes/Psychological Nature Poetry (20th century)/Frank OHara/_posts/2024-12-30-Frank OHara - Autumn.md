Autumn
Leaves turn,
            crinkling softly
in colors gathering,
          whispering stories
 to the ground,
yellow, brown and red,
    like heartbeats slowing down,
each piece drifting,
              going home where it belongs,
         a symphony of twilight,
   deepening skies gather,
               preparing for the close,
         beauty folds inwards now,
    a quilt of memories swirling,
      moments held like breath,
   in cool air,
           a final embrace,
before winter brings a pause.

— Frank O’Hara
