There is a song in the wind,
a warm breath across the face of the fields,
a melody sung by the waves
crashing upon the sandy shore.

The gentle rustle of the leaves,
a music soft as dawn,
the kiss of raindrops can touch the earth
with promises whispered every night.

I think of all the heartbeats,
found in the pulse of the world,
in the stillness that awakens first light,
all sing a gentle serenade.

- Sara Teasdale
