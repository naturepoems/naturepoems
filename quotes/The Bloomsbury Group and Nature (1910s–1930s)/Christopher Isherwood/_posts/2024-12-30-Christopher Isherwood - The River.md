The River  
Listen! The river calls,  
With the roar of its body  
As it rushes forth,  
Like a child’s laughter  
In the echo of the stones.  
“Come”, it sings,  
“come ride with me,  
Past shadow and light,  
Where glints of silver and gold  
Play on the surface,  
Where emerald reeds sway.”  
I descend to the banks,  
And place my hand  
In its cool brisk flow,  
Fingers intertwining  
With the cadence of life,  
I am forever changed in this touch.

- Christopher Isherwood
