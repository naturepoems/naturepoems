The earth has a beauty, with seasons in strife,
Resilience weathers each passage of life.
In storms and in droughts, her essence stands true,
With blooms that spring forth in colors anew.

The mountains, so steadfast, touch heaven and ground,
Whisper wisdom of ages through silence profound.
And every soft petal, each leaf on the tree,
Speaks of the cycle of lifeâ€™s reverie.


- Willa Cather
