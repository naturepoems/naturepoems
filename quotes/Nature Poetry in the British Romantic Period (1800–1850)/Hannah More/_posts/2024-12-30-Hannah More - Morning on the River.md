Upon the river's gentle breast,
The morning breaks in crimson hues,
And all the world is sweetness dressed,
As heaven's light the earth renews.

The lily floats like dreams of peace,
The ripple sings a soft refrain;
In nature's heart, our troubles cease,
And sorrows melt like summer rain.

Oh, take me to the woods so fair,
Where whispers float on fragrant air;
Where beauty dwells in every nook,
And happiness writes nature's book.

- Hannah More
