When the light doth hesitate,
And the shadows drift away,
Where beauty likes to congregate,
Where influences weave and sway,
There all delight converges flows,
Through the brook borne beneath the trees,
To lands that Nature shall enclose,
With speeches borne upon the breeze.

-- Robert Southey, "Nature's Harmony"
