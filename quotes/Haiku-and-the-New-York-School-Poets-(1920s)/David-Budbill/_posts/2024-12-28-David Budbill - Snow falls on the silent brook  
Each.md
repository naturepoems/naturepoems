quote: "Snow falls on the silent brook,  
Each flake a fleeting thought,  
The world is hushed,  
A blanket of white, soft as a whisper,  
Cradles the earth in peace."

Snow falls on the silent brook,  
Each flake a fleeting thought,  
The world is hushed,  
A blanket of white, soft as a whisper,  
Cradles the earth in peace.
