The Fish

With their fins going,
The fish lie dulled in a tank,
Pale and very high from the dark,
Caught, suspended, and lost with the water.
Dressed in silk, their iridescent colors dive and slide.
Yet they swim with all certainty,
As a tear escapes; the world swims back to serenity.
To treasure through capture, pin-stripe allings,
Red, silver, a spectrum in a tank of seawater.

- Marianne Moore
