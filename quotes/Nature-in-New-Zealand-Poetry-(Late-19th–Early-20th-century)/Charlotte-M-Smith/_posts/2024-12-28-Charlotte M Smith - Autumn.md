Autumn Leaves
Thy leaves are falling, golden-stain’d,  
Dropping like whispers from the trees,  
In colors rich by nature reign’d,  
Thou makest my heart appease.

They twirl and dance upon the air,  
A symphony without a sound,  
Their quiet notes, as if to share  
The tales of seasons round and round.

I see the sun in mellow hues,  
Embracing autumn’s careful song,  
For every leaf becomes the muse,  
In winding breezes, soft and long.

- Charlotte M Smith
