A Winter’s Day

On winter's day, the snowflakes fall,
In laces pure that softly call,
Each flake a dream, a wonder wait,
Wrapped in the hush, I contemplate.

The trees stand still, their branches bare,
A tapestry against the air,
Yet in this cold there blooms a voice,
In nature’s shroud, I find my choice.

As frosty breath enfolds the ground,
The stillness here is profound sound,
In every breath I feel the life,
Beyond this moment, away from strife.

- Dorothy Wordsworth
