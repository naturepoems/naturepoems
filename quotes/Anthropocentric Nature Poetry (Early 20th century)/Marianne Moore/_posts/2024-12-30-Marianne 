The Pine

Glistening limbs spread shade,
Echoing a scent of green,
The pine there stands, framed between,
Where silence yields so armed, awake,
With every rustle; the sound unmeasured.

As the wind makes its way,
Fragrant-bright in a careful gaze;
Those limbs swing past mellow today,
There is grace in the soft spaces out,
With each quietude and restful breath,
Where the trees quench the sun, afloat.

A care to adore the woods,
Against the sky, shades reset,
Warm with heights and barely stretch,
The pine draws near, out loud and clear.

Hope finds those tranquil pools,
Within their light a personal tune.

- Marianne Moore
