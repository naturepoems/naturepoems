Mountains rise with dignity,
  Their heads above clouds,
  A fortitude carved by time,
  They hold secrets of quiet strength.
  In their shadows, I find space,
  To breathe the life that pulses here,
  With each whispered sigh from valleys deep,
  I find my own truth and nature's grace.

  - from "Majesty of Mountains" (1925)

- Virginia Woolf
