So quickly, so fleet,  
The pale wind wind,  
And the frays of the trees,  
The leaves slip down like fish  
Under the shy green sun—  
Oh the sea, how it goes!  
And how my heart goes on,  
With the crashing of waves,  
With the singing of stars,  
In the light of the night!

- Edna St Vincent Millay
