The Spring

At once the snowdrops, raising heads of white,
Pass with fair sounds beneath the leafless trees;
With half-blown flowers like water’s hidden delight,
Desire draws near from distant outer seas.

Whence calls are mingled softly through the night,
And voices come that breathe an azure breeze.
Then through the twinkling twilight there comes the flight
Of wild birds veering, daring, touching leaves.
Breathe deep the air, whole-hearted you must feel,
A freshened purpose, spring’s enshrined ideal.
Then Bright the Waters rise and gage your zeal!

- Thomas Hardy
