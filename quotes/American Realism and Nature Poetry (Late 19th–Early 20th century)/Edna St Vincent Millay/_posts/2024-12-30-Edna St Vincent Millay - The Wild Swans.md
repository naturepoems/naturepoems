The world stands out on either side
No wider than the heart is wide;
Above the world is stretched the sky—
No higher than the soul is high.

The heart can push the sea and land;
And the sun and moon prevent the night,
And the time can come when we can see,
The greater things that bloom in light.

The wild birds fly and flutter past,
And the trees stretch high and bend;
And I am filled with Nature's breath—
The love that will not end.


- Edna St Vincent Millay
