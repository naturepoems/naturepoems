The Secret Garden

When the heart finds a haven away from the noise,
In a secret garden, where stillness enjoys;
With petals like whispers unfolding in grace,
A sanctuary sweet, where the troubles erase.

The flowers dance softly beneath the day’s praise,
As sunlight’s warm fingers unlock Nature’s phase;
With horizons that open like stories untold,
In episodes vivid, with blossoms of gold.

A brook sings in echoes, and branches entwine,
Where crickets will chirp to the rhythm divine;
In symphony balanced, where whispers entwine,
Dwells magic in corners where sunlight shall shine.

So come, and be wrapped in this haven of peace,
Where secrets of Nature her wisdom release;
In the heart of the garden, beneath the sun’s glint,
Life blooms in its glory, and sendings shall hint.
