The Sea

You are not alone in the seas  
of the past—  
there is light, there is love,  
and no end to the ways  
you can open up.  
Let the tide be the tide,  
the water so deep,  
it has no limit,  
nor do you.  
Each wave brings in  
a gift of newness—  
finding whatever memories  
molded your heart  
and the hearts of others—  
yellowed dreams of the tides,  
a new horizon to sail upon.

- Mary Oliver
