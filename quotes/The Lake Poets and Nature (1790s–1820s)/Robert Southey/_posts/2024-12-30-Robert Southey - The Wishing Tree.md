The Wishing Tree

A Ballad.

Half in the shade, half in the sun,
  A tree stood on the green;
He was a wishing-tree, and when
  To wish him well was seen.

If every leaf a treasure gives,
  Oh! how must aught be wrought!
Or if all fruits as sweet should live,
  Of sweets in all must be sought.

And oft when weary travellers trace
  The road with hope to find,
They rest beneath his leafy grace,
  And breathe the dream of mind.

For comforts that the woodland spell,
  And songs of summer days,
Invoke like charms, and whispers cool,
  Are paid their gentle praise;

Thus gladly they have words afresh,
  That goodness blesses down,
And speak of peace, that childhood's flesh
  Remembered in the town.

- Robert Southey
