The Fly

Little Fly,  
Thy summer's play  
My thoughtless hands  
Have brushed away.  

Am not I  
A fly like thee?  
Or art not thou  
A man like me?  

For I dance  
And drink and sing;  
Till some blind hand  
Shall brush my wing.  

If thought is life  
And strength and breath;  
And the want  
Of thought is death;  

Then am I  
A fly like thee,  
Or art not thou  
A man like me?

- William Blake
