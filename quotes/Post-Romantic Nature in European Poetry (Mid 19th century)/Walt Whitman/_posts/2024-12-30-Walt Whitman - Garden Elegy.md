Bee and butterfly, come close to me,
In the garden where colors bloom,
Each petal a story, wild and free,
An eternal revelry in full plume.

With laughter woven through golden rays,
The essence of life spills from the trees,
As the dance of creation humbly plays,
In the heart of the fragrant breeze.

O nature, how sweet is your embrace!
The banquet of life set to unfold,
Come walk, and share this sacred space,
For your treasures never grow old.

- Walt Whitman
