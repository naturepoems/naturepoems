Morning Mist

In the gentle embrace of dawn’s sweet light,  
A veil of mist hangs soft and slight;  
It clings to the grass, like a lover’s sigh,  
As the day awakens, and shadows fly.  

The world is hushed, still wrapped in dreams,  
As the sun peeks through, with golden beams;  
And as the mist begins to wane,  
The beauty of morning is ours to gain.  

Each blade of grass with dew adorned,  
Whispers secrets of being reborn;  
So let us cherish this fleeting bliss,  
In the magic of morning, life’s gentle kiss.

- E J Brady
