Before I built I’d burn it up,  
This land where trees and rivers cup,  
Filled with frightful whispers of the night—  
I’d stand perhaps for a moment right  
Then think of all the dreams it holds  
And all the land that comforts souls.  

For nature builds with strength and grace  
In every corner of this place,  
And when the forest bows to flame,  
We know it never shall be the same.

- Robert Frost
