The Wild Swans
As the evening sky  
Descends upon faded trees,  
Cloaked in reflections,  
The swans coordinate their fall.  
To heighten shadows,  
They makes way—  
The sea rises in troughs  
Of calmness  
That change us by transcendence.

With white-enamelled wings,  
The wild swans invade us, shining—  
And then they leave,  
Luminous in flight!

- Marianne Moore
