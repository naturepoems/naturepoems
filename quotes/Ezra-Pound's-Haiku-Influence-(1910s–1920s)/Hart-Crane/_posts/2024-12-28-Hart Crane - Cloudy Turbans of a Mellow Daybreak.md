Heaven unwinds, spills streaks through green。
Eagerly they wind themes both Mist and Break, 
While flashing moments come, as dreams are given free."

Cloudy Turbans of a Mellow Daybreak; 
Heaven unwinds, spills streaks through green。
Eagerly they wind themes both Mist and Break, 
While flashing moments come, as dreams are given free.
