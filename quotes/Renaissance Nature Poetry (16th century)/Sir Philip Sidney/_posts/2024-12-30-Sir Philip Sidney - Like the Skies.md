Like the skies, my heart draws bright  
In the morningâ€™s gentle light.  
Let me wander all the day,  
Through the fields where lilies play.  
In nature, I find my muse;  
In your grace I cannot lose  
Each sweet touch that love bestows,  
In this bloom where beauty grows.

Let the brooks with laughter sing,  
As the lark takes to her wing!  
In the air that breathes with love,  
Like a whisper from above!

- Sir Philip Sidney
