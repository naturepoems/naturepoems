Summer's End

When the sun begins to set
every night,
a soft kiss from the horizon,
each ray a reminder,
that life is meant to unravel,
a lesson in letting go,

of summer's warmth,
its embrace,
as the leaves turn gold,
becoming the promise
of all that is yet to come,
the dance of decay,
a wild song,
a fetch of time passing by.

It is a celebration,
this breath of stillness,
as the earth prepares
to rest,
we find ourselves inhaling deeply,
feeling the pulse
of nature's rhythms,
pulling us back,
to the center of our being,
where all is remembered,
where all is sacred.

Here, in this transition,
we awaken to the possibility,
that life unfolds with grace,
and in each ending,
there lies a new beginning,
a chance to start anew,
to embrace the wild,
as the seasons turn around us,
let it be so.
