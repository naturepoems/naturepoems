From the heights of the mountains,
a breeze whispers secrets,
a touch from the heavens,
my spirit mingles with the cloudsâ€”
I am the sky, I am the earth,
infinity folds upon itself.

Nature cradles my existence,
life and death entwined,
a fragile gift of moments,
a reality where I belong.

- Octavio Paz
