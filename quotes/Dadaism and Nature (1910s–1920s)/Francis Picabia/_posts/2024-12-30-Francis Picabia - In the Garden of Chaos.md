In the Garden of Chaos
In the garden of chaos,
every flower fights to bloom;
each petal a defiant note
against the symphony of the mundane.

We tend to each other
among the weeds of despair;
even in disorder we find grace,
a riot of colors,
a tapestry woven in rebellion,
a declaration of independence
from the silence of conformity.


- Francis Picabia
