Oh, I can see the forests green,  
Where every bead of dew is bright,  
And every flower a small machine  
That spins the shadows into light.  
The sunbeams dance on leaves above,  
And all the world calls out such joy,  
That with the wind, I lose my love  
In melodies the breezes buoy.

- Bliss Carmen
