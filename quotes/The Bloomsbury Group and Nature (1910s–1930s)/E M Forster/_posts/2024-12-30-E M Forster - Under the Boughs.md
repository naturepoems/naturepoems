Beneath the boughs of whispering trees,
Where silence speaks in gentle tones,
I gather thoughts like autumn leaves,
In solitude, my heart atones.

The fragrance of the earth's embrace,
The shimmering of morning dew,
In nature's clasp, I find my place,
Where every shade of green feels true.

- E M Forster
