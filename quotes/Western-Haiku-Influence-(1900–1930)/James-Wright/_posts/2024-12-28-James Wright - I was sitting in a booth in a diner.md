quote: "I was sitting in a booth in a diner, the sun was setting, and the snow fell over the trees, 
It is true that we lose each other in trees, in moments—and hardly notice, 
But a bluebird sings its bright song, that pierces the evening hush, 
And I feel all of it again, here in the amber light of late afternoon."

I was sitting in a booth in a diner, the sun was setting, and the snow fell over the trees, 
It is true that we lose each other in trees, in moments—and hardly notice, 
But a bluebird sings its bright song, that pierces the evening hush, 
And I feel all of it again, here in the amber light of late afternoon.
