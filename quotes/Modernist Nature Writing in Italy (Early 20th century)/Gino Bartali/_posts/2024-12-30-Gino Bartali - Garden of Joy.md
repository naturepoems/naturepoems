The garden blooms,  
a riot of colors,  
petals unfurling like laughter,  
a testament to warmth.  
Bees hum their grateful tune,  
a chorus of nature's choir,  
while butterflies flit by,  
a dance of grace and freedom.  

In this haven of life,  
each moment is sacred,  
a celebration of being,  
a reminder that beauty resides  
in the simplest of things.

- Gino Bartali
