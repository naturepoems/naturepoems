The bees do hum, as softly as the peace,
In every nook where shade and sunlight stream;
Hesitating on the petal's lips release,
A nectar creed to inhale from mellow dream.

The daisies' dance on emerald fields arise,
Where perfume-wefts entwine the balmy air;
In silent praise, under enthusiastic skies,
Nature reveals a tale both bright and rare.

Oh, wanderer, tread gently on this ground,
The harmony of growth is all around; 
Each leaf a whisper, each flower a sound,
In nature's grasp, we all are truly bound.

- John Clare
