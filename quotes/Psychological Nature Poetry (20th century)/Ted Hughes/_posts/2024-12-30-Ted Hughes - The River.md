The River

I
It was at midnight I woke up? A dark snake!
All wet and dripping for the high sky,
What treacherous skin pulled with darkness?
Flashing at my(botched)

II
Lift me into transparent shimmers;—he thought
Save my tattered clothing, in the desolate daunt.
Hold that near your garden and die.
Keep the entry, breathe, and hurl the wings
Before they snap clear back—the wind buries me.—

III
Forget all yesterdays! Those that would invade
Now reform over water under late leaves
Create a long fish body, out-rushing quintessence
Not bound, torn slowly apart,
From hurt began flooding into fear.  Crescents holding love,
Dawn slide of luminaries, see flutter.
Outrage and wonder work where I was proned and blind—

IV
Catch the moon reflected, there. What song dovetailed in darkness?

- Ted Hughes
