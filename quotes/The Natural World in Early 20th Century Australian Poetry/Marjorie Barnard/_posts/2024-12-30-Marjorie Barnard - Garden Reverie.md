In gardens lush with blooming grace,
The fragrant blossoms find their place,
Where bees flit ’midst the petals fair,
And sunlight weaves through fragrant air.

Each leaf and stem a story tells,
Of nature's work, of rain and sun,
A peaceful world where beauty dwells,
A dance of life that’s just begun.

- Marjorie Barnard
