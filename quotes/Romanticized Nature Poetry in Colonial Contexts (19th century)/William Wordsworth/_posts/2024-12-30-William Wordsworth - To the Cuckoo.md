To the Cuckoo
O blithe newcomer! I have heard,
I hear thee and rejoice:
There is a spell in their watchword.
And pleasing is the voice, â€”
So exquisitely good,
In peaceful hours by the wood,
Sweet maid that sings,
As I hear you,
Devoutly sing the willing woods and hills. 

O crying not for more,
Till I can call you mine!
And charming in your airy shape,
You have a constant voice,  
Cuckoo, cuckoo, on my quiet song!
Sing on, Cuckoo,  
A gentle breath along my silent mind.


- William Wordsworth
