The sunset paints the skies with fire,
Where hues explode in vivid show.
In nature’s arms, we find our desire,
As daylight bids the world hello.

With every shade, a story spins,
Of journeys, love, and laughter’s grace.
In nature’s realm, our life begins,
Awakening in this sacred place.

- Marie de France
