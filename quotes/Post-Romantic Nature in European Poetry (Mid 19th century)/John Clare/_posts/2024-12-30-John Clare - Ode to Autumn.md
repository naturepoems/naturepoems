Ode to Autumn

A thousand hues deck the trees,
And golden leaves fall lightly down.
Sweetly wrapped in autumn's breeze,
The world is clad in russet brown.

The white clouds drift along the height,
And evening glows in deepening shade;
Where vernal flowers, blooming bright,
May yet in other months be laid.

Yet am I drawn to every hue,
Each falling leaf tells tales of chill;
With simple joys of life so true,
I stand enchanted by this thrill.

- John Clare
