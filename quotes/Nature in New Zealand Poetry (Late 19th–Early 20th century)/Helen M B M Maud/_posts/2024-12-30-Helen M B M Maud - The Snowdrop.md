The Snowdrop

Awakened by the whispering cold,
The snowdrop peeks from winter's fold;
A fragile grace in purity dressed,
Against the frost, it stands impressed.

In tender hues, so soft yet bright,
It speaks of warmth, of coming light;
A promise sweet in white arrayed,
In nature's heart, hope's song is played.

So watch them bloom, those snowflakes near,
With courage found through chill and fear;
In every petal, life’s refrain,
A gentle nod, to spring’s domain.

- Helen M B M Maud
