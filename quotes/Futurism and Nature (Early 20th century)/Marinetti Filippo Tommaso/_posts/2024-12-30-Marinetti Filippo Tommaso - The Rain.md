The Rain
Oh rain, divine curtain,  
falling from the roasted sky,  
wash me of my fevers,  
bring me the green of a leafâ€™s embrace,  
immerse me in your foam,  
you who plunge down  
with that involuntary fervor  
of great gusts of timelessness!

The clouds bleed their silver mist  
while the trees sharpen their senses,  
whispering songs of life,  
life that is reborn in impact,  
you sing through me!

- Marinetti Filippo Tommaso
