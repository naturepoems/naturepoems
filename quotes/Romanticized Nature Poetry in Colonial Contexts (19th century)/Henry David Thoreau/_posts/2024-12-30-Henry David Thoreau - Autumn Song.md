Autumn Song
---

O Autumn! I hear you sighing,
Through the forest, crisp and dying,
Leaves ablaze, in hues confessed,
Golden glory in the west.

With every rustle, shadows play,
In twilight’s breath, I feel your sway,
As the geese in sorrow fly,
I gather ‘neath this endless sky.

---

Nature sings her last farewell,
Before the winter’s icy spell.


- Henry David Thoreau
