The Hills

Sweet is the air that I breathe again,
  Sweet are the hills in the dawn.
Their solitude cradles my heart with pain,
  While I wonder if ever a leaf was born.

O the heavy heart of the sunlit grass,
  The heavy star of the trees,
When the cloud of golden strength draws nigh,
  And the purple runs to the breeze.

I can see as now I have always seen,
  The arms of the woodlands rise;
They cover the ground in a shade thatâ€™s green,
  To reflect in the pallid skies.

For the hills are beautiful, never shy,
  They lay themselves out wide;
While I stood like a child who suddenly
  Cries out for joy without pride.

- David Campbell
