There Are No Suprises
There are no surprises in life —
Only the change in the form of the elements,
Reflecting humanity’s building blocks of a day,
In the whistling wind, and the mountains scale
In the silence, like a song into the streets.
As we wander through the image of our being,
In the essence of the clouds—finding goadruns,
Connected, beneath a sun that watches light 
Sing of descent, drift, and nature’s tune.
Through the new corners of the world —
The sound at the water’s edge — out of the house.

I chase after the sun’s discovery as it arrives,
An overwhelming and singing ode —       
A harmony that knits the patterns of our lives,
Touching the surface with simplicity and peace.

- Wallace Stevens
