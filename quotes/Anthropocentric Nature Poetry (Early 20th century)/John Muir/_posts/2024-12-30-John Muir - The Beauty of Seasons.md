The Beauty of Seasons

Through spring's embrace and summer's fire,
In autumn’s chill and winter’s choir,
The seasons turn, a rhythmic dance,
In every heart, a second chance.

The flowers bloom with colors bright,
While leaves grow old in fading light,
In droplets of the winter rain,
Comes life anew, again, again.

In nature’s hands, our stories lie,
We witness time as it drifts by,
The beauty found, both near and far,
In every season, shines a star.

- John Muir
