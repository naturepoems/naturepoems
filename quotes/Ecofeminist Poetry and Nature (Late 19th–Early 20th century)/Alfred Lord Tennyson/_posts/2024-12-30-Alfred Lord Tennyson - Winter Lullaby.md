Frosty air wraps the sleeping trees,
Glimmers of light flicker near,
Stars like diamonds, scattered with ease,
As the night breathes secrets, quiet and clear.
Nature's lullaby softens the chill,
Where echoes of life wait to renew,
In the quiet embrace of the white-clad hill,
We find our hope, our heart's truth too.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
