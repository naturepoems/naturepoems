The Last Decision  

Of course there were  

carys and prospects  

in the direction  

of coolness  

on to the moored  

sailing  

where the bay  

foreleads  

suncts as I watched  

the sun spread out  

a yellow  

and shimmering  

stillness  

carouselling  

bright  

and wider;  

My own relation  

of hope, watch -

I am the slender person  

of a curve  

as the pain goes  

through a clear day.

- William Carlos Williams
