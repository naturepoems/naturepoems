The Shores of Lough Neagh

In the hush of a summer’s evening,
When the sun went down, and the moon
Glimmered on the rippling waters,
I wandered by Lough Neagh’s shore
Where the willows leaned and sighed,
And the breeze played in the reeds.
  
Far in the distance,
The hills rolled softly under the sky
And the breath of the evening
Stirred the silence with its whispers.
  
The wild fowl cried in the twilight,
And a heron stood, grave and still,
Waiting for the rhythm of the waters,
As I breathed the peace of the night.
  
Oh cold and grey,
Dearest friend of the lonely
With thy tender heart, memory,
I have books of nature here,
And the world in my dreams.


- Charles GD Roberts
