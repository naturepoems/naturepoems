The Last Leaf
by W. S. Merwin

In the falling light of the evening,
Before the earth began to wait,
The last is now lying on its branch,
A single silence holding its breath,
Defying winds, in its delicate pose,
The tree is still framing the silence 
And world turns, forgetting, unaware.

- W S Merwin
