The sky, a canvas brushed with fire,
The clouds, like soft and silken lace;
O'er mountains wild my heart's desire,
To roam and rapture, seek and trace.
A world awakened, fresh and clear,
The chorus of the earth unbound;
As nature's anthem fills the sphere,
In every leaf and flow'r is found.

- Hamlin Garland
