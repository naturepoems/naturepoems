Reflections on the Lake
The lake lies still and mirror-like,
Reflecting the beauty of trees and sky,
In its depths, the colors dance and strike,
A perfect blend of the realms nearby.
As evening settles, the ripples speak,
Of the stories that nature tells to those who seek.

- Andrew Jackson Downing
