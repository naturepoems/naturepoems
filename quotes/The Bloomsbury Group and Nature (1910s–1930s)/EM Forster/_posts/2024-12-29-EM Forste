Summertime will call us back,  
In rainbow hues and falls of light,  
With willing hearts, we leave the track  
And venture forth into the night.  
To feel the earth beneath our toes,  
The laughter mingling with the dawn,  
In nature’s fold, our hearts shall rose  
With every song, a love reborn.

- EM Forster
