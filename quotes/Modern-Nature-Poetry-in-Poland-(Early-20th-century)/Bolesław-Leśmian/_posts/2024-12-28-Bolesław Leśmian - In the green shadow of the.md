In the green shadow of the grove,
The deer wander softly under the leaves,
Where the whispering winds through branches do rove,
And the heart finds peace, and the soul believes.

Dewdrops glisten in the light of the dawn,
Like pearls scattered on velvet grass,
Through the emerald fields the sweet scents are drawn,
As a symphony of nature flows vast.


- Bolesław Leśmian
