When autumn paints the trees in hues of fire,  
And whispered winds carry the songs away,  
The beauty fades, but stirs a heart’s desire,  
To hold on tight to memories of today.  

Each falling leaf, a story entwined with fate,  
Of cycles cherished, of new life to embrace;  
In Nature’s grasp, there lies a timeless state,  
Of love, of loss, of hope—and sweet grace.
