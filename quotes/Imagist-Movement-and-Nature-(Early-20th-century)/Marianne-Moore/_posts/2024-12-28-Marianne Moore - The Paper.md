The Paper Nautilus

I was thinking of you, my love,
and this, not as grace,
but swirls of all the elements—
elemental beauty,
nature’s roguish grace.
Pursued by threads of wind
and currents’ dark design,
its broad thinness separates my heart,
makes the sea alive with light,
it leads where the wind goes,
shines unto itself,
a Morse Code of impact, tumult,
decaying happiness in vastness,
a round perforation teeming,
the fate of being unknown.

—Marianne Moore
