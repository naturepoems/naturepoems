The scent of pine rivers through the air,
A sanctuary found in the heart of trees;
Nature's theater unfolds in green splendor,
Kissing the sky with freedom's embrace.

Birds glide gracefully, tracing arcs of hope,
Each feather a story of the skies;
In the stillness of the forest's breath,
We become one with the universe's truth.

- Anna de Noailles
