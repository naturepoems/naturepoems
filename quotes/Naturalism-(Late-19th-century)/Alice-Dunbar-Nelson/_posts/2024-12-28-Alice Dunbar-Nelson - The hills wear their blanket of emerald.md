The hills wear their blanket of emerald with grace,  

As the sun drips drowsily down to the vale,  

And the river reflects in a mirror-like lace  

The soft songs of evening, a coy loverâ€™s tale.


I will lie in this pasture of peace all my days,  

Let the time be a river; my soul shall imbibe  

The sweet gifts of nature, in whispers and praise,  

For in her gentle hands, my spirit shall thrive.

- Alice Dunbar-Nelson
