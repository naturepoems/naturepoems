The River Bend

At river bend, the waters flow,  
In gentle curves, the soft winds blow.  
Ripples echo like laughter's ring,  
In nature's arms, our spirits sing.
  
Beneath the willows, dreams unfold,  
A tapestry of green and gold.  
With every turn, new wonders find,  
The river's dance, forever kind.


- Halfred Lee
