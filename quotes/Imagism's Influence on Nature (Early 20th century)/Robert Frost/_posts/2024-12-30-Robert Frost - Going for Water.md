Going for Water
We went to give our quenched, tired cries,
Through the trees where the cold wind blew,
And the real world was lost in blue,
And silence came to mark our way.

We came upon the water spring,
It trickled gently by the cool stones,
And so we took it as a sign
Of laughter on a summer lane.

We laughed and danced beside the stream,
And there the silver lily blooms
Revealed a beauty sweet and still.
We reached with hands and hearts aglow,

To touch the morning,/a work of art,
As sunlight fell to bless our dreams,
And with a tenderness so great,
We filled our pails, and danced away,

- Robert Frost
