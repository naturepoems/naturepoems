The brook babbles softly, a lullaby sweet,
It weaves through the valley on silver-tipped feet;
Each ripple a story, each splash a refrain,
The music of nature, a chorus of rain.

Nestled in valleys where wildflowers grow,
I breathe in the wonder, let my heart overflow.
In the tapestry woven by sky, earth, and sea,
I find my connection, my soul is set free.

- David Jones
