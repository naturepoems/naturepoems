The Errant Wind

The wind wanders here and there,
Dancing lightly through the oak,
Whispering secrets, soft and low,
To the trembling leaves in the glade.

It carries echoes of far-off lands,
Songs of rivers that never cease,
And in its touch, the warmth of sun,
Cool kiss of twilight, sweet release.

It knows no bounds, no end, no rest,
A restless spirit chasing dreams,
Filling the air with fragrant hints,
Of jasmine blooms and flowing streams.

- Torrenti Orazio
