In the night, there are stories told,
By the whispering breeze and the stars,
Of forests deep and mountains bold,
Secrets borne in the glow of Mars.

Under a cloak of silken sky,
The world draws a breath, both tranquil and true,
Nature dances, and oh, how she sighs,
In harmony wrapped in shades of blue.

There, the river’s song glimmers like gold,
It weaves through the valley’s embrace,
Fingers of light across waters unfold,
Tracing the paths of this eternal race.

- Frank Norris
