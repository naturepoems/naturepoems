In Memoriam A. H. H.  

O living will that shalt endure
When the last bond of life is frail,
When all our days are but obscure,
Yet to the spirit still prevail.

At the still hour and in the night,
When all is hushed beneath the moon,
The soul shall take its outward flight,
Where vernal gardens bud and bloom.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
