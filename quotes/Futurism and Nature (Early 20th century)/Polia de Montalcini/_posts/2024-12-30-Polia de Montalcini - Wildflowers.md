Wildflowers

In the midst of striving steel,
beneath the weight of man’s ascent,
wildflowers push through,
bravely unfurling,
a riot of color among the gray.

Nature’s quiet rebellion,
a vivid pulse against monotony,
a reminder of the small things,
of beauty in resilience,
of life that dares to thrive,
even in scars left by time.

Pick them not, but cherish,
these tender whispers of freedom,
let them color your thoughts,
as you navigate your own path,
in a world that often forgets—
to see the wild within.
