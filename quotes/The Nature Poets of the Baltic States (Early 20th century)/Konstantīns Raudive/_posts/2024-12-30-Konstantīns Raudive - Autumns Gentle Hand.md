Autumn's Gentle Hand

With autumn's gentle hand,
The world is kissed in gold,
Leaves dance to the ground,
In a symphony of color,
Life's canvas brushed anew.

The air, crisp and clean,
Carries whispered blessings,
As the earth sleeps softly,
Preparing for winter’s embrace,
A cycle of rest and renewal.

In this fleeting moment,
I breathe deep the change,
Embracing the beauty,
Of nature's fleeting breath,
As time wraps me in its folds.

- Konstantīns Raudive
