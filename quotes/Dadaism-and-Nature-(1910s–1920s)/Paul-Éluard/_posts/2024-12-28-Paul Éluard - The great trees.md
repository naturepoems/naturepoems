The great trees sway,
Beacons of life from root to tip,
And the sun spills its golden laughter,
Bouncing off the surface of the lake.
Children of soil, flower and stone
Embrace the chaos that nurtures them,
Their petals a vibrant uproar,
Their fragrance a riot of sensations.

Come play in the fields,
Where reality melts and bends,
In the wildness of nature,
The heart beats to the rhythm of freedom.

- Paul Éluard
