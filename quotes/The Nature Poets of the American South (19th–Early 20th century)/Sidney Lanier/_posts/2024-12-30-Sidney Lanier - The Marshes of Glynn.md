The Marshes of Glynn
O, mysterious Night!
  The lenient darkness of the world,
  Soothe and conceals; here in this
  Tranquil glade my mind unfurled.

And while the night o’ wraps, I lose
  The burden of the world, and see
  Ghostly glimmers in the dew
  Its mystic joys spin free.

Thou art the spirit of the trees,
  The spirit of the shining sea,
  O gauzy shadows on the leaves
  And running springs, to thee!

O,-eyed stars behind the mist,
  Tied to memory and reverie,
  I take my place among the reeds,
  The soul must wander free.

- Sidney Lanier
