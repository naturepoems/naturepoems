The Fish

I caught a tremendous fish
and held him beside the boat
half out of water, with my hook
fast in a corner of his mouth.

He didn’t even fight.
He just lifted his gills in the sea
and hung there, while I buied
his gaping face, his scales

and the love that came
with them, so that day
I kept it in hand and began
to let it go again.
