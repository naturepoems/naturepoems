The world is always full of
    amazing things,
But the silence is why I wander.
Among the gentle streams,
And the shadows playing,
On the surface of the lake.
The beauty here is wild,
It shakes me with thunderous peace.
To be still—is an art:
It is to gaze and not speak,
Just see.

               – From "The Lake"

- Annie Dillard
