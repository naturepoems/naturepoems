In the serene and solemn night,  
An endless veil o'er the world is laid,
While beauteous stars, with twinkling light,
Gaze from afar, in silence arrayed.

Awake, O heart, to Nature's call,  
Listen her softly spoken tune;
The moonlight spreads its silver thrall,
And dreams arise beneath the moon.

As shadows dance in soft embrace,
The earth is wrapped in hushed delight,
In this repose, calm and serene,  
Find peace, oh dear, in Natureâ€™s sight.

- James Russell Lowell
