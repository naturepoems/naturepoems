The daisies twinkle in the grass,
And whisper tales of countless hours,
While soft wings gently flutter past,
To steal away their fragile flowers.
The brook sings softly, ever clear,
Winding through the vale so wide;
I find in its harmonious cheer,
A solace that the world can't hide.


- Gustave Flaubert
