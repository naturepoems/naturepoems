In the bright sun shall I go forth,
To haunt the tangled vine,
And chase the summer's joyful mirth
By flowering woods of pine.

Where swift streams sweep, and winds do play,
And shadows stir the peace of green,
In golden light to find my way,
My heart shall keep the joy I glean.

- George Edward Woodberry
