Nature's Mirror
In still waters, reflections dwell,
A mirror to the sky above,
The mountains bow, the rivers tell,
Of nature's power, and endless love.

We glimpse the world, our hearts aligned,
In every ripple, life unfolds,
In this embrace, our souls entwined,
Natureâ€™s tale forever holds.

- Aldona Gustava
