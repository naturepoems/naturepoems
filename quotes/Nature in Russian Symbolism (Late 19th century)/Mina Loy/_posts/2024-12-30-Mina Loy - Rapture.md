Rapture
I shall lift my voice
as the leaves lift to wind,
I shall direct the leafâ€™s dance,
where flowers spin upwards,
opales blushing green,
bodies uncoiled of root.
Come not near,
nor cling to the veil of petals,
or let me grasp you,
you who are old
as the dust of dreams
and the soft mutterings
beneath the stars.
Sprung from native soil,
I shall embody my song.

- Mina Loy
