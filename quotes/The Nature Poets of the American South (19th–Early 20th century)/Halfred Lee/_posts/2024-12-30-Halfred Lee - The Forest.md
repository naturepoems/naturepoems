The Forest

In the forest deep and wide,  
Where shadows softly glide,  
Whispers of the ancient tree,  
Call to all, come walk with me.  
  
Leaves that dance in the softest breeze,  
Branches bending, with graceful ease,  
In evergreens' embrace, find peace,  
Nature's harmony will never cease.


- Halfred Lee
