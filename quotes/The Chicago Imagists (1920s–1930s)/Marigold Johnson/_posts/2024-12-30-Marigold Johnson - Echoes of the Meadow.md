Echoes of the Meadow

In meadows wide, where daisies bloom,
The echoes of the past resound,
With every breeze, they chase away
The shadows where old dreams are found.

The earth is rich, and life abounds,
Each petal holds a memory dear,
In nature's lap, all joy surrounds,
As laughter spills from flowers near.

- Marigold Johnson
