The Beauty of the Rain
Oh, how the rain gently falls,
A balm for earth’s thirsty calls,
Nourishing roots deep in the ground,
With every drop, a soothing sound.

It washes away the dust of age,
Turning earth to a vibrant stage,
Where blossoms rise and colors blend,
In the heart of nature, to mend and extend.

- Gabriel Okara
