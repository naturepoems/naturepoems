Ode to Autumn

    O autumn, in your robe of gold,
    You bless the earth with grace;
    Your bounty, rich, a tale retold
    For every time and space.

    The leaves that flutter gently down,
    A carpet for the ground;
    The grapes that hang, a jeweled crown,
    With joy of life abound.

    So let us sing, O hearts of light,
    For nature's fair embrace;
    In autumn's arms, all is made right,
    And we find our rightful place.

- George Meredith
