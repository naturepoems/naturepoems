To The Moon

O moon, thou watchman of the night,
Thou art the dreamer’s keen delight;
In silver glow you bathe the earth,
Eternal sign of silent worth.
  
With patient grace you guide the lost,
In every shadowed wood you toss’d,
The traveler’s heart, with dreams, awakes,
To find the light that morning makes.
  
O guardian of the starry stream,
In thy soft glow I dare to dream;
For in your light, the dark is bright,
And hope endures throughout the night.


- Charles GD Roberts
