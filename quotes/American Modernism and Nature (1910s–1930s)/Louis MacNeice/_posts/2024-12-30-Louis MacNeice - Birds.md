Birds  

The countless flapping  
Across the darkening skies —  
New whispers arise, such are tales behind  
Each wing, stretching pulse in distance.  
Longing shadows flutter down,  
As the last blaze of day wraps on them  
To draw both light and dusk as partners  
Mingling ease, faint joy as unto silence.  

Unconfined now, visions thorough  
Dance with the shadows built by flight;  
Bindings soothe before the timbre draws  
And in that lull, the woven notes merrily bless,  
These fluttering names untold —  
All absorbed in the colours  
The eye loves still, beyond this memory.  

Wings come back, lonelier against the grow;  
Yet how mournful and sweet,  
As speak once round  
In a dusk unfurled, these hidden things  
Gather by my hand like circling stars,  
Like a father cupped,  
Where lover waits entwined in lifelike, bright.  

This heart wades on, wanting the flight,  
As whispers bow again, so loved, so new.
