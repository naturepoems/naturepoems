In these woods, I find my belonging—
The rustle of leaves,
The call of an unseen bird,
As it weaves its song,
Through ancient branches,
Time flows like a river,
Blending with moments,
In the sacred stillness,
Where my spirit learns
To listen, to hear the whispers
Of the very soul of earth,
And find the truth within,
That speaks to every heart.

- Henry David Thoreau
