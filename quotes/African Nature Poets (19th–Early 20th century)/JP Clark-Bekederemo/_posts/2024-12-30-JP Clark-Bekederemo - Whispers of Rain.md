The rain is a whisper,
A soft, soothing breath,
It caresses the leaves,
And colors the earth.

A dance of droplets,
In rhythm with the trees,
They sing to the flowers,
A melody of peace.

As rivers swell with joy,
And grasses sway and glide,
The rain brings forth the life,
With nature side by side.
