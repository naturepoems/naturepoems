The Oven Bird
The bird that pushes its life in the shade,
With a faith for even the light less among
The trees shows that something’s still alive,
He sings to take you worlds apart; touching heads,
With every note, so no song could go wrong;

And once some fray might fall far away,
The service of swamps is opening up
The music here among the light—
And those soft wings came back to find the skies,

Too slight but too old to bring its song, 
It saw the willow trees and leaned just more
to it with beauty bound in new-born growth.”
And carry only children far from this eye.

- Robert Frost
