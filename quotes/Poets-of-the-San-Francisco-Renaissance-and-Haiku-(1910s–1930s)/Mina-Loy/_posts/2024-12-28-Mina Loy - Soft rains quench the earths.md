author: Mina Loy
quote: "Soft rains quench the earth's thirst,
Paving the way for crickets,
With their chirps interwoven,
A melody threading the leaves,
Here the earth breathes deep,
Time slows its pace, 
Each droplet fosters life,
Bees awaken to sips of nectar,
Morning winks in fragrant blooms,
Nature's pulse, alive, dancing."

Soft rains quench the earth's thirst,
Paving the way for crickets,
With their chirps interwoven,
A melody threading the leaves,
Here the earth breathes deep,
Time slows its pace, 
Each droplet fosters life,
Bees awaken to sips of nectar,
Morning winks in fragrant blooms,
Nature's pulse, alive, dancing.
