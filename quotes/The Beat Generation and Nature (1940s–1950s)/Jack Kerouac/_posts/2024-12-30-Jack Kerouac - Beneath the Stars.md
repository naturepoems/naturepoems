Beneath the Stars

The vast horizon clings
to the night,
and I walk beneath
the wild stars,
sharing secrets with
the wind,
of dreams caught in
the web of life.

Why should I fear
the unknown,
when the moonbeams
dance along my path?
The forest whispers, too,
as if remembering
old stories, faded echoes,
within the soft rustle
of the trees,
heartbeats of history.

Nature listens,
she understands,
all that is beautiful,
all that is fleeting,
reminding me of truth,
that we belong here
alongside every creature,
every stone, this
ancient earth.
