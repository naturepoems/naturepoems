At Night
The sky is a blanket,
    dark yet alive,
full of peering stars,
        the moon’s soft palm
  makes an embrace
       while rustling trees
    whisper softly of secrets;
I walk in silence,
         inhaling the night scents,
   feeling alive,
        knowing what it means
 to be lost in light,
and surrounded by shadows,
everything turns and turns,
   at the face of the sea,
   waves lapping down,
with echoes calling me home.

— Frank O’Hara
