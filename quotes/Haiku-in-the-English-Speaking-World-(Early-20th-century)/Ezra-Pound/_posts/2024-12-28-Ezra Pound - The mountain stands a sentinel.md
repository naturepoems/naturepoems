author: Ezra Pound
quote: "The mountain stands, a sentinel,  
   cloaked in mist and shadow's embrace,  
   ancient as the earth itself.
    
   Here the eagle soars above,  
   on thermals, high and free,  
   nature's majesty unfolds in silence."

The mountain stands, a sentinel,  
   cloaked in mist and shadow's embrace,  
   ancient as the earth itself.
    
   Here the eagle soars above,  
   on thermals, high and free,  
   nature's majesty unfolds in silence.

- Ezra Pound
