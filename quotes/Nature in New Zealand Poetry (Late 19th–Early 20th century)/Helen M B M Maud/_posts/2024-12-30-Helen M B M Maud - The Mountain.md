The Mountain

Tall sentinel of Time, thy brow
Bears crags of ancient kingly might;
Eternal, crowned with whiteness now,
Like snow, a vast expanse of light.

The winds unfold thy time-torn face,
While ages past and ages yet,
Lay secrets deep in thy embrace
In solitude, where mortals fret.

Yet, high aloft, thy peaks do soar,
A savage beauty speaks of grace,
Thou art the ancient mountain shore
That greets the sun’s soft morning trace.

- Helen M B M Maud
