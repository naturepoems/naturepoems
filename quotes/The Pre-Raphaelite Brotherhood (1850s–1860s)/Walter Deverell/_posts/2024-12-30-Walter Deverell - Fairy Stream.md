FAIRY STREAM

Beside the brook, where ripples lightly glide,  
The bobbing blooms in splashes of delight,  
I watch the dance of pixies here abide,  
With sprites that flit through temperate twilight.  
Oh let me wander where the world is bright,  
In murmurs soft, the air is pure and gold,  
The fairy stream whispers secrets of the night,  
In nature’s cradle, my spirit feels bold.


- Walter Deverell
