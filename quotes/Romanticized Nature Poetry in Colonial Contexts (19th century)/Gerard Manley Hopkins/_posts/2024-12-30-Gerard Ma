God of heaven, God of light,
In the sky, stars are bright;
See their smiles in marshes deep,
Let my heart awake from sleep.

Cloud and sunlight, dew and rain,
Value lives; where thorns might strain,
Grow in blooms; for joy unfolds
In the heart, as life behold.

Guide me with your shining grace,
To forever seek and embrace
Nature's beauty; a world sungâ€”
Be thy praise forever young!

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
