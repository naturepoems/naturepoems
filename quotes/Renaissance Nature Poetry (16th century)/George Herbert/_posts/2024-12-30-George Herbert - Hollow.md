Hollow

The dust from this hollow earth I sing,  
Can be the clay that takes these forms to rise  
In endless beauty.  
For haven must have blooms, light, and soil,  
The glories it can boast, with shades of night, 
When the sun rose, we found our griefs were led.  
Our living savior claims a share of thisâ€”
Each barren field is blessed with golden light or snow.



- George Herbert
