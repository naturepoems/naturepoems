Spring
---

I love to see the sign of spring,
The flower, the breeze, the bee’s light wing.
It speaks, with a cheerful, happy song,
Of promise, of beauty, and life’s throng.

Children murmur on the shore,
While buds open wide and the sweet hearts soar;
So tell me, oh spring, what joys you bring,
Each year renewed, through life's fleeting swing.

---

Life dances with the flow of all things,
As spring reveals what the winter’s time brings.


- Henry David Thoreau
