The Daisy
The daisies of the open field,
With blossoms pale of ivory hue,
And golden centers, all revealed,
Against the sapphire sky so true.

Small blossoms scattered, bright as light,
That dot the meadows green and fair,
They dance and twinkle in delight,
And fragrance wafts upon the air.

Beneath the sun’s warm, gentle rays,
These flowers sway as breezes blow,
They throng the banks, in sweet displays,
And dance with joy in nature’s show.

Interpretations of the morn,
In vivid colors, soft with grace,
And waking whispers, fresh and reborn,
In every garden, bloom and place.

In quiet realms of peace they grow,
In secret glades they freely dwell,
A symbol pure through all the flow—
What nature loves, they love as well.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
