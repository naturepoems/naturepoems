Autumn spills its palette,  
Painted leaves afloat,  
A fire that dances in the breeze,  
Igniting the trees in hues  
Of amber, crimson, and gold.

Crisp air tinged with nostalgia,  
Carries the scent of harvest  
And the promise of gathering,  
As nature prepares for rest,  
A slumber deep in the earth's embrace.

Each step crunches softly,  
Memories beneath my feet,  
And I tread gently through  
This vivid dreamscape,  
Where the majesty of decay  
Is a reminder of cycles,  
Of endings that nurture  
The seeds of tomorrow.

- Fritjof Nansen
