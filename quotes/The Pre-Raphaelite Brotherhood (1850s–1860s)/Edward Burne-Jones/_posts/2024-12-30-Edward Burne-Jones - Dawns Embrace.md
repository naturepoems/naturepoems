Dawn’s Embrace
 
As dawn breaks softly o’er the land,  
A blush of light, a golden hue,  
The world awakens, hand in hand,  
With whispers of the day anew.  

Birds rise singing, skies ablaze,  
Each moment fresh, a brand new start,  
In nature’s arms, our spirits gaze,  
Upon the beauty, heart to heart.

- Edward Burne-Jones
