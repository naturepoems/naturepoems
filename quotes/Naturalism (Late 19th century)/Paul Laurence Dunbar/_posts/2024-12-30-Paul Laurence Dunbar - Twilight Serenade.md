The sun has set in a golden glow,  
The evening light begins to flow.  
With shadows that stretch upon the ground,  
And peace descends without a sound.  

The twilight whispers soft and low,  
Where nightingale's sweet voices flow.  
In quietude, the world finds grace,  
As stars alight in silence's space.

- Paul Laurence Dunbar
