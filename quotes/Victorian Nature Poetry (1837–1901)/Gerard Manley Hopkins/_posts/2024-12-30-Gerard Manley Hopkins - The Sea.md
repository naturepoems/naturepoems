The sea is all about us;  
The sea is all about us.
Pointing to flame-red, purple,  
Footings gone past;  
Your brow still perspiring, burning,
Your light head keeps up a sway  
  
The world goes, trembling, telling,  
A thought dropping, heart breaking,  
For purple crowns is opposing;  
And like girded caps they are.  

The sea is all about us.
At night, stars shining
Wild with their humility.  
When faces show their songs  
With beatitudes equivalent,  
What peace sways low!
And the busy wave there too,
  
The sea is all about us.

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
