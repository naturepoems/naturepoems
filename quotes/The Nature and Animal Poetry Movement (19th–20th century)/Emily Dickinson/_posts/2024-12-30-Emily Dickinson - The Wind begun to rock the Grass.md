The Wind begun to rock the Grass  
With threatening tunes and low—  
He toss'd it to and fro,  
And made a whispering sound—  
It mock'd the Drops that jostled by  
And hurried through the sky—  

I wonder if before the Winter  
She knew that it would be—a Snow—  
A little lattice overhead  
Would save the Sun—to me!  


- Emily Dickinson
