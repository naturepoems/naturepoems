The Bight

After the storm clear,
the sea fern shoots up,
scattered across the sandbanks,
like gems.
Forsaken of clouds,
the lighthouses dim
as they leap
out into the known.
Hope waits to learn
what is foolish. 

The boat tips
and flows away,
as the depth, obscured
by foam,
often dims,
hovering with lines of pale.
