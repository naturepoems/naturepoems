The Sound of Trees  
I wonder about the trees.  
Why do we smell the leaves  
When the wind is stirring?  
It’s like the hidden secrets  
Of what we fear in life.  
Are they trying to tell us  
Some message?  
Why are the branches turning,  
And leaves flying from their trees?  
There is a sound in the tree tops,  
But no human can hear it.  
It is wise not to listen too closely  
Or we may lose our way in the forest.

- Robert Frost
