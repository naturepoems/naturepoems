The Garden
In the garden’s bloom,
Where petals unfold like stories,
Life dances in colors bright,
Bees hum a tune of sweetness,
And the earth breathes in delight.
Each flower tells a tale,
Of rain and sun, of night and day,
The beauty here is fleeting,
Yet it lingers like a sigh,
Moments captured in a breath,
Nature’s fleeting whispers of love.


- John Gould Fletcher
