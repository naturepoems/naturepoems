When the day breaks bright with a golden hue,
And the sun wakes up the world anew,
In the dappled light beneath the trees,
There's a whisper of magic and gentle breeze.

The wildflowers bloom in colors bright,
Painting the earth with sheer delight,
And all around me, the creatures play,
In natureâ€™s embrace, I wish to stay.

From the rustling leaves to the babbling brook,
In every nook, in every overlooked,
Nature offers gifts of peace and cheer,
A simple joy that draws one near.
