I saw a Lord riding by:
His horse was of the gallant kind,
The sun shone on the gallant eye,
The dust was on the passing wind.
A lady hailed him from a tree,
When she saw he was passing by:
They clasped their hands and looked and smiled,
But brushed the dust from the passing sky.

They laughed and loved; but heedless did
They grow upon the forest floor,
For sweet in tune the Lord did say,
'What are these birds you keep in store?'
The lady turned, and turned again,
And in the wind the leaves did take
With noise like laughter mixed with tears,
The love whose triumph we did make.

In love's great heart, just turned aside,
The wind's quick kiss was blown away,
And still they laughed, and love was wide
And free as silver glimmering ray.
Expanding trees curled down in shade,
And sung around the whispering night,
For we are blessed in love's delight,
The joy you sought shall never fade.

- Henry Vaughan
