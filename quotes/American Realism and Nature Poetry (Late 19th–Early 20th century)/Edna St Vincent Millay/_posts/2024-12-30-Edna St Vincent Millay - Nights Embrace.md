The moonlight glimmers on the lake,
As gentle whispers kiss the trees;
The night is full, and dreams awake,
In Nature’s arms, I find my peace.

The stars are scattered like confetti,
In darkness, they begin to play;
And as the night unfolds its beauty,
My heart unveils its sweetest say.


- Edna St Vincent Millay
