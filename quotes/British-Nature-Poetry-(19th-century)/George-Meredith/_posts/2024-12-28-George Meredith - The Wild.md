The Wild Rose

    O wild rose, in your blush of bloom,
    On moor and woodland fair,
    You speak of life beyond the gloom
    And whisper joy through air.

    The sun doth bring your petals bright,
    And dew doth grace your frame;
    You dance beneath the silver light,
    And breathe in summer's name.

    Let every heart that long has slept,
    In dark and lonelier ways,
    Awaken now, for love has crept
    Within your fragrant days.

- George Meredith
