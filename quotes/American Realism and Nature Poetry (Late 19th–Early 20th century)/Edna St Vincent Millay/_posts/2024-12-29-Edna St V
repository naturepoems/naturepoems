The Unreturning  

What speaks to the returning time?  
What of the burnished night, the night,  
To see the sorrow of the year?  
For blooms must break to fall once more  
Counting every tender hour.  
So here I take  
The memories of returning past,  
The tremors of a broken dream,  
Made clean in the waters of the earth!

With a thousand sunny breaths,  
What flies above upon the rise!  
Round every climb,  
There's a whisper of the night,  
Calling back;  
Should not I fall?  
And feel this pulse of time upon the song  
That speaks of dreams, forever fading!  

Away, dear blooms!  
Find joy within the  waiting day  
That takes me far with gracious light,  
And echoes of the ones I've loved,  
With laughter gone;  
That wafts above, unseen;  
To the new that calls us home!  

For in the universe of blooms  
And striven themes, they are  
What finds its place with me at dawn,  
Where winds pursue,  
None can sway my heart,  
As silence waits to fill the bright!  


- Edna St Vincent Millay
