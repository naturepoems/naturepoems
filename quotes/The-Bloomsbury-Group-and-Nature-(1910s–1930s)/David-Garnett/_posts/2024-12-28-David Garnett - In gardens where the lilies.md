In gardens where the lilies sway,
And roses blush with pride,
There lies a truth that finds its way,
In every petal’s glide.

The fragrance of the gentle breeze,
Unfolds a memory sweet,
Of moments wrapped in love’s reprise,
In nature's grandest seat.

Let peace be found in leaf and stone,
In blossoms soft and rare;
For every heartbeat, not alone,
Is felt in nature’s care.

- David Garnett
