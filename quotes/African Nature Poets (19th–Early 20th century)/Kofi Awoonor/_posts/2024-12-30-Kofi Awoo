The Dance of the Seasons

In the cradle of the earth’s embrace,
Time unfolds like the petals of a flower,
Each season a dancer in vibrant robes,
Bringing forth the beauty of life anew.

Spring arrives with a gentle whisper,
In bursts of color, life awakens,
And the melodies of birds soar high,
In a chorus of hope, a promise reborn.

Summer’s laughter fills the air,
With the warmth of the sun upon my skin,
As the fields bask in golden glory,
And the nights hum with the rhythm of joy.

Autumn dons her gilded gown,
Painting the world in hues of gold,
While the breeze carries tales of change,
Calling us to let go, to embrace the cycle.

Winter wraps the earth in silence,
A blanket of snow, pristine and still,
And in the stillness, I find a moment,
To reflect on the dance of all that is.

- Kofi Awoonor
