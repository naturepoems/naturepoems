A Garden Song

Lyric weeds, and flowers flown,
  With evening's green, crowned dome,
Where scented wafts from waterstone
  Shall lead my footsteps home.

   The hour draws close, yet life remains,
   When all ye say sung sweet is due,
For what the earth contains,
  Life weaves its threads anew.


- Ben Jonson
