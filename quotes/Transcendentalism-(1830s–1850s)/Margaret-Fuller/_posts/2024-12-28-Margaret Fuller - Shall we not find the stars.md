Shall we not find the stars above?
When we breathe in the woods, do we not feel,
The vastness within, the spark of soul?
Life is a whisper of unity’s wheel.

The river flows gently, carving its course,
Whilst each stone has its place, finds its power,
In the tapestry woven by nature’s own hand,
The heart beats in time with the bloom of the flower.

Faithfully nurtured, in silence we grow,
Together as one, the world we can heal,
In unity strong, as soft clouds drift past,
Let all learn the love that the earth can reveal.
— Margaret Fuller
