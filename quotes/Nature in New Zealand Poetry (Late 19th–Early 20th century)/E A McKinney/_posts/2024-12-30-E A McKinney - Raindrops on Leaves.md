Raindrops on Leaves

Softly they fall, the raindrops clear,
Whispering tales that only they hear,
On leaves of the ferns, in puddles they play,
Nature’s own laughter, in gentle ballet.

Each droplet a gem, so pure, so bright,
Reflecting the world in refracted light,
On the earth they dance, in a rhythm so sweet,
With every cascade, life stirs at their feet.

They sing to the flowers, the roots, the soil,
Refresh the brown earth, as they lovingly toil,
An orchestra formed by the skies’ own weep,
In nature's embrace, we’re lured into sleep.
