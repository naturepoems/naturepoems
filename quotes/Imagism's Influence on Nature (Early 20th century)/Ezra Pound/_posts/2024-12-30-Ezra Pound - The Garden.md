The garden contains the belief
That every thing shall be here.
In the deep of the tree,
In the light of the bloom,
In the wing of the bee.
Grapes in red clusters.
Soft is the air of the valley.
Here we are; silently growing.
Here we are; becoming.

In the rapture of the great formal trees,
In the blushing roses expanding,
Here we are. Open to eternity.

- Ezra Pound
