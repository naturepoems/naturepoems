The morning light dances on dew-kissed grass,
While the songbirds awaken, their warbles amass.
The world is a canvas, painted with cheer,
As nature sweeps in to cradle us near.

With every gentle breeze and soft rustle of leaves,
Comes a promise of peace that the spirit believes.
In the heart of the forest, the stillness befalls,
A harmony breathed in the wilderness calls.


- Willa Cather
