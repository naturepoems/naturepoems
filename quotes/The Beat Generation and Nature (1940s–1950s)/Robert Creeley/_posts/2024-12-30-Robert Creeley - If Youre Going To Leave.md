If You’re Going To Leave

If you’re going to leave, 
now’s the time. 
The flowers are for you, 
or even not for you, 
even, they may be hard, 
a push to the heart of it.
It is all I’ve wanted 
from the earth, the open
spaces, the quiet limbs.
When you go, I cannot know
where you will be but with
only wind, grass.


- Robert Creeley
