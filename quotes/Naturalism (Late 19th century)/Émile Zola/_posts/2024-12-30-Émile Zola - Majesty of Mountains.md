Mountains rise daunting, their peaks kissed by snow,  
a testament standing where the fierce winds do blow.  
They cradle the valleys in steadfast embrace,  
a sanctuary forged in the rough of their grace.

As the seasons do pass, and the rivers do wend,  
it's a cycle undying, no beginning no end.  
In the grandeur of nature, a power we seek,  
to understand our place in this silence, so sleek.

- Émile Zola
