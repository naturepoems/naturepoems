In Harmony with Nature
The rustle of leaves, the river's song,
In nature's arms, where we belong,
With every breath, a bond we weave,
In harmony, we love, we grieve.

The earth our home, the sky our dome,
In fields of green, we carve our tome,
Each flower, tree, and star above,
A testament of life and love.

- Mieczysław Wojnicz
