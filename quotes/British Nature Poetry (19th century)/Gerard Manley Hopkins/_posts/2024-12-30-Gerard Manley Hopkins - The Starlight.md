The Starlight

In dark drape all I brace—  
In every voice thine emblem grace,  
Where not only the fold would drop,  
But I, collapsing, nab the air in bloom.

Singing a slumberous song,  
All patterns arose in truth,  
And in night’s silence, fell right.  
This arc show a wave in smooth wrinkling, growth.

— Gerard Manley Hopkins
