Fallen Snow
  
  The fallen snow lies thick and white,
  A blanket soft on nature’s bed;
  It hushes all, both day and night,
  As silence wraps the world ahead.
  
  In winter’s grasp, the world transforms,
  Each branch outlined in crystal lace;
  A wonderland, where magic forms,
  And peace descends to every place.
  
  The footprints trace a winding path,
  Where children laugh and spirits play;
  In every flake, a secret bath,
  The joy of life in winter’s sway.
