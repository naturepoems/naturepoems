the little birch
tree, trembling,
         watches
       the cutting
   of its dark, riddle
          with
   a flaring flame
      of colours,
  scattered,
falling,
   like the
           stars
          over
   a wandering
    wood;
     it dances
        on the winds
           of summer
       and laughter 
             and reigns
   in no chain
                  of
      restraint

- E E Cummings
