All things are composed of water,  
And thoughts flow onward like the stream;  
To see such beauty reflects  
In calm repose the tranquil dream;  
So feed the fire!  
O river, pour your tears!  
Through the ages past, I know  
There lies a future plain,  
And all its changeless shades repeat our fears.

- Lord Byron
