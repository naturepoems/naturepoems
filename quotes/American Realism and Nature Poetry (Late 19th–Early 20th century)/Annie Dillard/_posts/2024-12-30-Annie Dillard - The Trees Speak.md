When I feel small,
Among the tall trees,
I understand why
They reach high. In their branches,
I see eternity.
Their strength holds me,
When I think I am less,
And from their roots,
I learn of stability—
Of time and place, of purpose.
To belong, to grow.

               – From "The Trees Speak"

- Annie Dillard
