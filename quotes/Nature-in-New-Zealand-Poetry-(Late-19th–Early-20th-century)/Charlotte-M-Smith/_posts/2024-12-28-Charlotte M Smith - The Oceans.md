The Ocean’s Call
O splashing sea! thou call' st to me  
To wander by thy side—  
Thy waves—like silvery melody,  
My human heart abide.  
I hear the whispers of thy foam  
And see the sunlight play  
Upon thy aqua blue—the home  
That draws my spirit's day.

Each lilting wave a tale of old,  
Of love and loss and might,  
Thy echoes tell—my heart behold  
The soft and silken night;  
As nature’s voice resounds in thee,  
In gentle, flowing ease,  
I find my soul—forever free  
In the ocean’s sweet disease.
