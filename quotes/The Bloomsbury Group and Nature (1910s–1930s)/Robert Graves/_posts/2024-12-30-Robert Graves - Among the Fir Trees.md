Underneath the heavy boughs
Where the great firs breathe,
You and I shall wander,
Hushed by the voices of shadows.
The petrichor kisses the worn roots,
And the cool breeze sings
With crystal cadence.

I am wondering if skies
Might writhe in a world unseen,
Where the goldfinches flash
Like memories in light.
May we drink the morning dew,
And offer thanks to creation;
Hearts fabled and bare, 
To the solace of nature's care. 


- Robert Graves
