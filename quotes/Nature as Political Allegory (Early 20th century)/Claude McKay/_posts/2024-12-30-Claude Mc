Autumn Song

The leaves are dropping, dry and frayed,
They perished in the weather’s mood;
Bring forth a song of nature laid,
In autumn’s cool, quietude.

The trees stand stark, their limbs laid bare,
Against the gray of overcast,
The winds stoked whispers in the air,
Of sunken green where glory passed.

The fields once brightened by the sun,
Now dust and shadow held in pain;
Yet still the thoughts of what was fun,
Awake when pulses beat with rain.

Remember me the joyful choice,
In every grain of black and gold,
The laughter of the rustling voice,
The bloom where life had been so bold.

In autumn’s heart, my spirit sighs,
In yearning trails of earth’s design;
And though the winter's chill may rise,
The echo of the fall is mine.

- Claude McKay
