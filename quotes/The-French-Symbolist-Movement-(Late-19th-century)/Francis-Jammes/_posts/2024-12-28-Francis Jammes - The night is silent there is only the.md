The night is silent; there is only the sound
Of the pulse of the ocean at my feet;
The stars are gathered in their own blue towers,
And the heavens are reflecting my heart, my tears,
Consumed by the distant warmth of love.

There the winds cradle themselves,
And the sweet fragrances of wild thyme,
Whisper dreams to the dainty larks,
While the moon beholds all in tranquility.
There's a glimmering in every bush,
A surrounding life that beckons me onward.

- Francis Jammes
