In the branches of the oak, 
The moonlight siftsâ€”
Softly breathing, 
A nightingale sleeps.

The leaves whisper secrets, 
Rustling dreams.
How sweet the night, 
With its pale and tender gleams.

The sky's a vast expanse, 
Of azure and calm, 
Where shadows gather, 
And the cool winds balm.

In this peace, I find, 
A world reborn, 
Where nature speaks, 
And the soul is worn.

- Andrei Bely
