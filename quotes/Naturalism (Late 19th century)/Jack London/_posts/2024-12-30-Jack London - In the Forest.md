In the Forest

The trees stood up like giants proud, 
Their branches swaying, deep and loud, 
While leaves cascaded down like rain, 
In the midst of whisper, in the heart of disdain. 

Moss covered the age-old stone, 
Ancient power echoing all alone, 
The creatures scurry, the shadows dance, 
A vibrant life in nature’s trance. 

Every rustle generous, every sound divine, 
With wildflowers weaving a colorful line, 
This enchanted realm, so graceful, so free— 
The forest is life; the forest is me.

- Jack London
