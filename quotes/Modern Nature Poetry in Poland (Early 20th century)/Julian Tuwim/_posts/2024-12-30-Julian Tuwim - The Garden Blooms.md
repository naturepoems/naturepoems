The blossoms bloom in wild abandon,
A riot of colors in the sun,
Every petal a story woven,
Of life embracing, never done.

Bees hover in the fragrant air,
Busy with the symphony of life,
Each buzz a note in nature’s song,
In this dance, no room for strife.

The garden blooms with untamed spirit,
In its chaos, beauty finds way,
Life bursts forth from the earth’s embrace,
In nature’s heart, forever stay.

- Julian Tuwim
