quote: "The fern fronds plume the green,
And the shadows stretch at daylight’s break;
A world of lace cradles the air,
In zones where lovers hold their breath—
The trees lean closer, speaking in tongues,
Their conversations breathe through the mist."

The fern fronds plume the green,
And the shadows stretch at daylight’s break;
A world of lace cradles the air,
In zones where lovers hold their breath—
The trees lean closer, speaking in tongues,
Their conversations breathe through the mist.

- Marianne Moore
