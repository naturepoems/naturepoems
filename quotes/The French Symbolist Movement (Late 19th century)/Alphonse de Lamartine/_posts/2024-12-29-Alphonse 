In evening's veil, when shadows creep, 
    And twilight wraps the earth around,
    The stars above begin to weep, 
    While in their light, my dreams abound.

O gentle night, so rich with peace, 
    You cradle every hidden sigh,
    Your whispers bring my heart release, 
    Beneath the vast and endless sky.

The moonlight blankets all in grace, 
    As every flower seeks to glow,
    In natureâ€™s arms, I find my place, 
    Where time transcends, and sorrows slow.

So let the stars guide me tonight, 
    Through nature's whispers, soft and clear,
    For in this dreamscape, pure delight, 
    I find my heart forever here.

- Alphonse de Lamartine
