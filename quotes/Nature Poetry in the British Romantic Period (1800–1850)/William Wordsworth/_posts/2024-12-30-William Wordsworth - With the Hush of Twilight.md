With the hush of twilight, peace descends,
Nature wraps us in her arms,
And scattered stars will shine like friends,
And waken laughter’s harmless charms.

The flocks will roam, the streams will flow,
And evening songs will call me near;
The gentle spirit of the glow,
Under the loving skies draws near.

- William Wordsworth
