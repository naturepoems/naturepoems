As autumn leaves begin to fall,
A carpet of colors, nature’s sprawl.
The crisp air speaks of change anew,
Life cycles through in shades and hue.

Fires crackle under starlit skies,
With whispered tales of goodbyes.
Yet in this stillness, we find our place,
In the dance of seasons, nature’s grace.

- Clive Bell
