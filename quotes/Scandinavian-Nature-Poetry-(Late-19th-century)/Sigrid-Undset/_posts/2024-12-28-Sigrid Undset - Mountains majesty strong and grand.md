Mountains majesty, strong and grand,  
Whispers echo across the land.  
At their feet, the flowers bloom,  
In vibrant colors, dispel the gloom.

Rivers wind with a gentle ease,  
Carving paths beneath the trees.  
Every stone, each drop of rain,  
Speaks of mountains, speaks of pain.

- Sigrid Undset
