In the midst of the chaos,  
there lies a quiet wood,  
a little patch of Earth  
where the heart can listen  
for the pulse of life.  
The leaves whisper secrets  
of seasons long gone,  
while the sunlight dances,  
cross the branches above,  
painting a tapestry of gold  
that tells the story of  
a day that belongs to  
the wild.  
Here, the moments linger,  
a symphony of birdsong  
in the breeze,  
reminding the weary traveler  
of the beauty  
in the simplicity of being.

- Lanford Wilson
