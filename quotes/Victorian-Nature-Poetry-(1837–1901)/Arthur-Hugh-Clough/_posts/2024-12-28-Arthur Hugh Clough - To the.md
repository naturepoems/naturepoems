To the River

O river, shallow brook of song!  
   My thoughts among thy waters play;
In gentle flow thy murmurs throng,
   In ebb and flow I drift away.

The stones beneath thy surface meek,
   By winds awakened in the sun;
Tell me, dear river, wherefore seek  
   The endless road I tread upon?


- Arthur Hugh Clough
