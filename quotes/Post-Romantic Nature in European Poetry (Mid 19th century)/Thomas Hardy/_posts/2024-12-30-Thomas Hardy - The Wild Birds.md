Amid the storm that rages high,
See how the wild birds wheel and cry
As naught can stay the bitter scourge,
But they, with winged flight, emerge.

As evening falls, a silence deep,
Descends upon the earth, to keep
A peace that shields from worldly plight,
The whispered calm, the tranquil night.

- Thomas Hardy
