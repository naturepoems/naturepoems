The Call of the Sea

The sea is a stranger, singing to me;
She calls in the morning at the flashing, waking sun;
Her lullaby whispers when all may be still:
When the men shake and gather that the night must come.

And I know not the wandering ships of my own,
The scented sails and the winds flutter up and around;
But a wave has caught me, and bides my desire
As I walk by the wares of command unto the coast.

With the wild and roaring winds that are ever loud,
There is a lonely storm that rides on the sands;
Though sometimes the sun does hark me with grace,
And the birds will scatter to give of their hands.

The light of the day must cascade in odd tokens;
The sea must be fitting for waters abound;
The night that is lonesome must have its strong words,
When the stars speak my heart where the darkness resounds.

- John Masefield
