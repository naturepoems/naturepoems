The Sea Fairies

Oh, to be in the sea!
Where the deep waves are dancing high,
And the soft sighing breeze,
Like the light of the moon,
Wanders all the night,
And the stars from above,
Like the eyes of the sea,
Twinkle brightly down.

To wander beneath the foam,
To roam where the mermaids play;
To drift through the waters,
And dream of the sky,
To be in the sea,
Oh, to be there!
The silver and gold
Of the treasures below,
Are of naught to me
If I cannot go.


- Philip Webb
