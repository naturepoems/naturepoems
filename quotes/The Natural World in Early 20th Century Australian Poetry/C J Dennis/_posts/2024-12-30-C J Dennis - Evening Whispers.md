In the quiet of evening, when the sun dips low,
Thereâ€™s a hush in the world, and the rivers flow slow;
While the stars wink with secrets, and the moon starts to rise,
In the embrace of the darkness, we find our allies.

For the whispers of night, hold the tales of the day,
As the world wraps in slumber, in soft shades of gray;
And the symphony hums in the stillness of night,
With the heartbeats of nature, that fill us with light.


- C J Dennis
