In nature's midst she cleaves the air,
Where all creation spins and whirls,
And dalliance awakes without a care,
As softly perfumes swirl.

The trees do shelter all beneath,
Their branches grand, adorned with dreams,
And eagles cry their lyric wreath,
While buzzing honeycomb gleams.

With every glance, the valley's flow
Invites the heart to pause and stay,
To savor what’s alive and grow,
Where life itself will find a way.

Let whispers touch the strands of thought,
Where every bloom in silence weaves,
In nature’s arms our solace sought,
The place where every heart believes.

- Matthew Arnold
