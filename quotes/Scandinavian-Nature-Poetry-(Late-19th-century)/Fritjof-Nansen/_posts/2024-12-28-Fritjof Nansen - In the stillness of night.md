In the stillness of night,  
The world lays breathless,  
Bathed in silver moonlight,  
As stars punctuate the dark,  
A sprinkle of diamonds  
Upon a blanket of velvet.

The forest breathes  
With ancient wisdom,  
As the leaves whisper stories  
To the gentle night breeze,  
And the creature's calls  
Echo through the shadows,  
Reminding us of the wild  
That thrives while we dream.

Here in this profound tranquility,  
My spirit finds solace,  
Cradled by the gentle arms  
Of nighttime's embrace,  
And I am but a fleeting thought,  
A wanderer beneath the stars.

- Fritjof Nansen
