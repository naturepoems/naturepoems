I dwell in Possibility –  
A fairer House than Prose –  
More numerous of Windows –  
Superior – for Doors –  

Of Chambers as the Cedars –  
Impregnable of Eye –  
And there, the Lamplight’s luster  
So ample – I could die –  

My soul to realize it –  
And give it all her own –  
This more than State’s arrangements –  
There – in the spirit’s Tone –  

Of Beauty’s crash of realness –  
Without the darkened Wane –  
A Thousand songs shall utter –  
Yet, none can take the Flame –  

The Teeming hopes of women –  
That oft are yet undone –  
And glossed is Nature’s plaything  
When Nature rests – and stuns!

- Emily Dickinson
