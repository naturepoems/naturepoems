Sunday Morning
Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her.
This is a poem of the modern life
Of the ordinary day, of easy existence;
More than one person thought to be there.
Let us join the morning in this
And to the beaten, the worn idea.
Thus when the sun on high
Goes brightly among the birds,
I claim that beauty is everywhere
To be found, among the grass and the trees.

Wherever we walk, we see its mystery,
What are the hidden meanings of leaves,
The color of the sky as the sun ignites
All that is beautiful, vivacious
In this profound sense of nature.

- Wallace Stevens
