Here the great Pan, in natural cheer,  
Takes up his reed and pipes, and all  
The riotous realms of woods do hear  
His song, which stands for Natureâ€™s call;  

All-inviting come and see  
The beauty of sweet liberty.  
The river runs, the flowers grow,  
And laughter echoes high and low.  


- Michael Drayton
