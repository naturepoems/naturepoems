A Summer Night
The moonlight hangs upon the trees,
And silver lace is woven through
The branches where the night-wind frees
Its music, and the leaves renew.

A murmuring stream flows soft and low,
And casts a song from pebbles bright,
While sheeny stars with mystic glow
Reflect their beauty on the night.

Here, in this tranquil, cool retreat,
Where shadows play with tender grace,
The world lays down its dust and heat,
And finds a calm, serene embrace.

—Charles Tenney Jackson
