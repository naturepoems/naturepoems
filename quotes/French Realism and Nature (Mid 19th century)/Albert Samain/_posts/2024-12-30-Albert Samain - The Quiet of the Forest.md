The Quiet of the Forest

Deep in the heart of the forest prime,
Where sunlight threads through verdant roof,
Time lingers, stretching like a rhyme,
A sanctuary far from proof.

Soft moss blankets the gentle ground,
While ferns unfurl their feathery grace,
In nature’s choir, there’s music found,
Each whisper a story, a sacred space.

Branches weave tales under a sky,
Where wildlife plays in an unseen spree,
Echoes of longing, a lover's sigh,
In the language of trees, of earth’s decree.

O let me drown in this silent embrace,
Where the murmur of wind speaks low,
With every breath, I find my place,
In the quiet of the forest’s glow.

- Albert Samain
