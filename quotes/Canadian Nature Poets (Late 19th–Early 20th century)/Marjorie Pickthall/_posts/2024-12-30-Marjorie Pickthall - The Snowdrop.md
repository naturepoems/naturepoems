The Snowdrop

Through winter's grasp, a light appears,
The snowdrop blooms, a silent grace;
In shivering earth, the hope rears,
A fragile flower's soft embrace.

With petals pure as wintry light,
It whispers, "Spring will come again;"
In every bud, a heart takes flight,
Transcending time, the quiet rain.

- Marjorie Pickthall
