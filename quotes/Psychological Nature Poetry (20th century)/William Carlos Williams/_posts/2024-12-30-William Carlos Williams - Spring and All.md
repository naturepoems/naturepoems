Spring and All

By the road to the contagious hospital  
under the surge of the blue  
moon's rays  

one dead tree  
forms the view  

of the bright new spring  
that has gone  

and so it is  
coming back  

and I should not be surprised  
if this was all there was to  
all our truths.

- William Carlos Williams
