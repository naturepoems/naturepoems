These are not mere stories,
By ancient bards retold;
But living, breathing glories,
In green and marbled gold.

‘Tis in the falling leaves that speak,
Of every moment’s grace,
Where nature's heart begins to seek,
Her whispered, soft embrace.

The valleys wide, the flowing streams,
Shall ever hold my soul,
Where every shadow light redeems,
And makes the senses whole.

- William Wordsworth
