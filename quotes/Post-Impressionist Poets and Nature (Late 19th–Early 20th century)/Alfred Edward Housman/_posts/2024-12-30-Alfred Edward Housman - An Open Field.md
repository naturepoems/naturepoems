An open field, a sky so blue,
A world laid bare, a quiet view,
In every grass blade, tales are spun,
Of things that fade and those that run.

Yet through the changing light of day,
The nature sings, and finds a way,
To hold within its vast expanse,
The stories told, the life’s mere chance.


- Alfred Edward Housman
