Harvest Moon

Under the glow of the harvest moon,
Fields shimmer like waves of gold,
The night awakens with a gentle sigh,
As nature's story continues to unfold.

Amidst the wheat, the crickets sing,
In rhythmic dance, they celebrate,
The bounty of earth, the toil of hands,
A moment to pause, to contemplate.

With each shining ray of silver light,
The world is bathed in a soft embrace,
In this nocturnal serenade, I find
The beauty of life's simple grace.

- Torrenti Orazio
