They come, the thundershowers,
amidst the summer without caution,
a battening down, a gathering of winds,
the bursting bright of nature's tears
washing sins from weathered stones.

A rush of life in every drop;
young brooks surge in frantic glee—
all bearing witness to the pulse
the earth’s joyful anarchy unfolds.
