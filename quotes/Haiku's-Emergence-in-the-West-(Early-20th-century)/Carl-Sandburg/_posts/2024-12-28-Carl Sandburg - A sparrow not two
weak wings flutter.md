weak wings flutter of summer,
coughs the loose change
of laughter among the green,
its tiny heart beating,
now in the palm of dusk."

A sparrow, not two,
weak wings flutter of summer,
coughs the loose change
of laughter among the green,
its tiny heart beating,
now in the palm of dusk.

- Carl Sandburg
