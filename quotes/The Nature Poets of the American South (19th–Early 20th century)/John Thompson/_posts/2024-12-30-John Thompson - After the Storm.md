After the Storm

The clouds drift away,
In the wake of the rain,
Nature wears a smile,
In the sun’s gentle reign.

Puddles reflect,
The sky's azure hue,
And the fragrance of earth,
Is fresh and renewed.

Oh moment of respite,
After thunder and fright,
You gift us with peace,
In the afterlight.

- John Thompson
