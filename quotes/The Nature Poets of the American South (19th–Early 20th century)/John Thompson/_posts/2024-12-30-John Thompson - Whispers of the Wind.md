Whispers of the Wind

Softly do you sigh,
Through the leaves you play,
Carrying secrets,
Of night and of day.

You rustle the branches,
You dance on the ground,
In your gentle embrace,
Peace and calm abound.

Oh wind, sweet wind,
Carrier of dreams,
You weave through the valleys,
Where the river gleams.

- John Thompson
