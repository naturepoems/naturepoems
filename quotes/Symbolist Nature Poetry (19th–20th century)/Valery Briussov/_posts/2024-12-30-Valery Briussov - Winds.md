Winds

In every gust that rushes past,
The winds bear tales from lands afar,
With whispers wild, their voices cast,
In nature’s breath, they are a star.

They dance through groves, through fields of gold,
With laughter light, they twirl and sway,
Each gust a story yet untold,
In every breeze, they find their play.

So let the winds come sweep you up,
And carry you to worlds unknown,
For in their flight, we fill the cup,
Of every dream that’s ever blown.

Embrace the wildness, feel the flow,
In every breath, we find our kin,
Through nature’s heart, let spirit grow,
For in the winds, we shall begin.
