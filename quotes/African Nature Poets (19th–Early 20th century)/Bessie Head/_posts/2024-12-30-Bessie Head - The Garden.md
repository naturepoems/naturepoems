THE GARDEN  
In the garden, the colors blaze,  
A riot of greens and reds,  
Petals trembling in the sun,  
Life exploding everywhere.  

Each flower tells a story,  
Of love and care,  
Watered by gentle hands,  
Warmth of smiles—a tender space.  

Listen, listen, for they speak,  
Of shared moments beneath skies  
Full of stars, and laughter shared,  
In the whispers of the trees.  


- Bessie Head
