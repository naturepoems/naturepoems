quote: "I found a box
of teabags half open
in the cupboard.
They were old—
not one was used.

This is a silence,
so weighty
it creaks still,
in memories and summer evenings.
The tea may draw
warm water deep inside me."

I found a box
of teabags half open
in the cupboard.
They were old—
not one was used.

This is a silence,
so weighty
it creaks still,
in memories and summer evenings.
The tea may draw
warm water deep inside me.

- William Carlos Williams
