The Poem

The poem is not

no different than a

flower bed.

In spring along the

garden paths

where winds will blow

the petals.

The sun appears

with its warm hand,

and down the row

from plant to plant

they talk of things

we cannot see.

Our words regret

only their shape,

like ants moving

among the gold fields.

- William Carlos Williams
