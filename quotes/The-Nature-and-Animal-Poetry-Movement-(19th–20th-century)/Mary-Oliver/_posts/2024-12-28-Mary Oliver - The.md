The Pond
In the shape of the world,
the light falls,
as it always has,
into the pond of my heart.
Where the stillness waits,
the water’s eye reflects
everything beneath,
every dance, cloth of gold,
and everything collected below
at the water’s bottom, can be seen.
So still is the night—the earth,
everything within,
will find itself,
find a step faster into morning,
when the light spills freely,
when the moment reveals itself
in weightless wonders.
Praise be for the shaping—for the still pond.
Though the hunter may come, beware—
this is the joy of it all, the stillness,
on which I will walk softly and quietly,
reflectively and peacefully.
A hunger of the heart
and a longing of the soul.

- Mary Oliver
