Poetry

Poetry is the dream,
The dream is aspiration!
And the dreamer's heart must beat
With the pulse at the center of the sun.

So take away those claw-like hands,
Take away that rude voice that hurls
The darkness against the silken light,
For any pain gives birth to a tree
But life is a garden and we must title it
Not only the shadows of our dreams
But the heavy scent of what is real
And what is good.

Let the singers come!
Let them bear up the pain to the singing!
Let them make the earth tremble with joy!

And in that moment when man holds man
As brothers bearing their hearts home together,
Let joy burst like a rose in the darkness!

- Langston Hughes
