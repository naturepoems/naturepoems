Spring

Nothing is so beautiful as spring—  
When all things wake to life again;  
And just as all the birds will sing,  
So leaves will blossom from the grain;  
The dew which glistens in the morn  
Is but the love of nature born.

For in the grass, as green it grows,  
We see our lovely time displayed;  
And just the flowers which bloom in rows  
Are echoes of the love conveyed;  
So thus it speaks in forms so sweet,  
Of beauty that we cannot beat.

— Gerard Manley Hopkins
