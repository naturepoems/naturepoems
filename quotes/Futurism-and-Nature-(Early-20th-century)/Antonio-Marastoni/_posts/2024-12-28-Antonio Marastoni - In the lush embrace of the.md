In the lush embrace of the wild,
Where rivers dance and mountains breathe,
The pulse of nature, fierce and mild,
A symphony that never sheaths.

A canvas stretched, horizons bright,
Colors clash in vibrant play,
Electric storms ignite the night,
While time dissolves, it slips away.

- Antonio Marastoni
