The Summer Night

When twilight falls and shadows creep,
The world transforms in hues divine,
And crickets sing as day doth sleep,
In amber skies, the stars align.

The gentle breeze stirs through the trees,
With whispers soft, a tender sigh,
In nature's arms, I find my ease,
As summer’s night enfolds the sky.

O blissful moments, linger here,
And hold me fast till morning's light,
Within this peace, I’ll cast out fear,
As heart and soul take flight tonight.

- Amelia Welby
