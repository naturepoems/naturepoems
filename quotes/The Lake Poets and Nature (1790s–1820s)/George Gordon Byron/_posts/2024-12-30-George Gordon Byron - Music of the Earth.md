The earth has music for those who listen,
A melody that dances through the trees,
In every leaf that glistens,
And whispers gently in the breeze.

The silent beauty cloaked in stars,
The echo of the nightingale’s song,
Is nature’s voice, breaking all bars;
A harmony that feels so strong.

So pause a while and close thine eyes,
Let the world fade, let worries cease,
For in the heart of nature lies,
The fleeting joy, the truest peace.

- George Gordon Byron
