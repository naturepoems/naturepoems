The Locust Tree in Flower

Upon the locust

tree in flower

the scent of honey,

and buzzing bees,

the white blossoms

in afternoon light

fill the air with sweet

fragrance and soft whispers

of summer's breath,

growing deep

in the stillness,

a pause to grasp

this fleeting beauty.

Let all who pass

be lulled by

this gentle grasp

of time.

- William Carlos Williams
