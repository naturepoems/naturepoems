A Place of Solitude

Amongst the towering pines,
I find my sanctuary,
Where the world retreats,
And the cacophony fades,
Leaving only the pulse of nature.

Here I can breathe,
In the purity of the wild,
Where each rustle of leaves,
Is a reminder of life,
Unraveled, unspoken, yet profound.

This place of solitude,
Is my heart's dwelling,
Where I commune with the sky,
And dance with the shadows,
In a celebration of the everlasting.

- Konstantīns Raudive
