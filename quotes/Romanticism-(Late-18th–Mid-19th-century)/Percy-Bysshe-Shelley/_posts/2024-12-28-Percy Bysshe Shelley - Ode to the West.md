Ode to the West Wind
O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,
Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,
Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou
Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed
The wingèd seeds, where they lie cold and low,
Each like a corpse within its grave, until
Thine azure-chambered wife, whose innocent eye
Looks through the laughs of the sky, shall blow
Thy clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and all
The chords of the winds shall be heard.






- Percy Bysshe Shelley
