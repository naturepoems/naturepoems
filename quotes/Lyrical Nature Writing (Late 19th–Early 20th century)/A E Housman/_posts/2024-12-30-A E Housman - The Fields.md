THE FIELDS

In days of yore, when Earth was young,  
And fair the fields did sway all day;  
Where nature’s dance, a song unsung,  
Would bring a sigh, then fade away.

The pastures hold the sun’s embrace,  
And rivers run through valleys wide;  
Oh, let me dwell in this pure space,  
Where beauty reigns forever bide.  


- A E Housman
