The Steeple-Jack

He is occupied with a dream; dressed
delicate as a daisy; with a billow
   of lighter years spilling from on high,
     he watches the masters of the heavens drift
     like wisps of white through the water,
       and the chime of the church bells
         strikes his ear and become his song.
His own hands are his scaffold; he climbs
   above himself, mounts the steep, alone.


- Marianne Moore
