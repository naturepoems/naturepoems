Clouds drift slowly in
the blue,
the air thick with
a sense of time.

Birds call to one another,
sweet notes rising,
and suddenly falling.

Leaves murmur with
the wind,
creating a symphony
as the day
slowly wakes from sleep.

Each moment is
captured,
each breath a wild,
fleeting joy.

- Ted Berrigan
