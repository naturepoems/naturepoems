The Beautiful
by Gregory Corso

The beautiful
is not only
a picture
or a scene,
but the whole
greatness of nature,
an immense sky
that opens
like the blue mouth
of a child,
a circular lake
that howls for marshmallows,

The beautiful
is the step of harmony,
the grass rolling
in green, 
a child singing
in no language,
a fat woman dancing
with cool roses.

And the beautiful is
the ache in my heart
that makes me feel
more than real
or perhaps,
everything I ever wanted
piled on my chest.

It’s the burn of inspiration
climbing my back,
a small funeral
for the lost,
while ecstasy
cradles the leaves of evening.

This beautiful,
still existing,
untouched,
that lingers like dew
upon the window of time.


- Gregory Corso
