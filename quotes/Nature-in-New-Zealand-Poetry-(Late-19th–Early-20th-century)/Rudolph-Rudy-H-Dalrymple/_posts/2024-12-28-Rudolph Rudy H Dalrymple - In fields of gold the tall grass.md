In fields of gold, the tall grass sways,
As summer’s warmth caresses skin,
The world, ablaze with sunlit rays,
In nature’s lap, our souls begin.

To wander far and seek the light,
To hear the call of distant lands,
With every step, the wild ignites,
A journey bound by nature’s hands.


- Rudolph Rudy H Dalrymple
