The Plain Sense of Things
The plain sense of things
Is the starting point of the poem.
And just as the nightingale, singing,
Strays about the wilderness,
So must the poet rejoice
In the truth of the swaying trees.

With gladness, seeing Nature's way,
He sees the sun and shades
a safe soft, fertile silence,
Dancing amidst the frost of the pines,
With nothing to claim but the day itself.
And as the days unfold,
He sees that the world abounds
With the simple beauty of age-old grace.

- Wallace Stevens
