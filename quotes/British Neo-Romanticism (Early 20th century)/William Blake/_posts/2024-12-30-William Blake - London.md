---

I wander thro' each charter'd street,
Near where the charter'd Thames does flow,
And mark in every face I meet
Marks of weakness, marks of woe.

In every cry of every Man,
In every Infant's cry of fear,
In every voice: in every ban,
The mind-forg'd manacles I hear.

How the Chimney-sweeper's cry
   These are the great evils.
And the hapless Soldier's sigh,
   From the camp or mortuary.

But the path of the best,
   And the worst are but one road,
   As we must reconcile
   all that is lost.

- William Blake
