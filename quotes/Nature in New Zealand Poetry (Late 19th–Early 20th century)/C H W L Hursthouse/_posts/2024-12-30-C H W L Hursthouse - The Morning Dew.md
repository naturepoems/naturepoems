The Morning Dew

Upon the grass at break of day,
The morning dew like diamonds lay.
A gentle kiss from night to morn,
Each droplet speaks a world reborn.

The sun’s first rays, with gilded quest,
Awake the sleeping earth in rest.
And nature stirs, her heart aglow,
As life returns in ebb and flow.

So treasure every sparkling sphere,
For in their beauty, truth is near.
The simplest gifts from nature’s hand,
In dew and dawn, forever stand.
