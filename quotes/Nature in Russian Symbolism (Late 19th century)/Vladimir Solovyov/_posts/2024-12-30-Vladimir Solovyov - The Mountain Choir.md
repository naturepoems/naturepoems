The mountains rise, a silent choir,
Their peaks adorned, like crowns of fire;
In timeless strength, they stand so bold,
Guardians of secrets yet untold.

Each valley carved with love divine,
In every stone, a spirit shines;
The rivers flow, a thread of dreams,
In nature's heart, forever beams.

- Vladimir Solovyov
