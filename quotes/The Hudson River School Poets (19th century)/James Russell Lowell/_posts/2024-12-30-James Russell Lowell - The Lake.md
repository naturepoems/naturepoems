The Lake
  
In the gentle twilight fading,
When the sun is passing down,
And the woods begin their soughing,
And the dew is on the brown;
When the echoes hang in silence
And the stars glow faintly bright,
I will seek the tranquil water
For the sweetness of the night.

All is peace, and all is beauty,
Starlit glimmer on the lake,
Not a leaf shall breathe a tatter,
Not a ripple stir to break.
In the serenely azure silence,
In the soothing angle of Heaven,
I shall find a calm together,
I shall hear my song of Seven.

- James Russell Lowell
