Beneath the Sky
Beneath the boundless azure,
Where clouds drift like wandering thoughts,
I lay upon the softened grass,
Listening to the wind's lullaby,
The rustle of the leaves,
A symphony of serenity,
It beckons me to dream,
To lose myself in the vastness,
And find my place amongst the stars.


- John Gould Fletcher
