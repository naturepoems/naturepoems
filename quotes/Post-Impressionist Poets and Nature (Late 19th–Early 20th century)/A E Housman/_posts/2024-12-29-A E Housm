You’ll find the brook that sings at morn,
Among the hills where dreams are born,
And hear the laughter of the trees,
As breezes carry soft, sweet vows, and leaves.

So wander here beneath the boughs,
Let peace repose with every cause,
Among the glades where time stands still,
In nature’s grace lie all fulfilled.

- A E Housman
