Autumn's Whisper

Beneath the boughs where colors bleed,
The autumn leaves begin to fall,
A tapestry of crimson and gold,
Nature's final, wistful call.

Each rustling footstep sings of change,
A soft reminder of time’s sweet flight,
In every hue, a story strange,
As day gives way to tranquil night.

- Marigold Johnson
