Here we discover
that nakedness
is a sweet gift,
a hum of arrival,
a pulse of wind,
a kiss of droplets
as they rest on the skin,
a merging,
a celebration of life.

The dance of the leaves
is the song we forget,
that stirs our hearts
underneath brittle skies
that threaten but never fall.

Open your eyes,
open your ears,
the sound of water
is a calling of spirits,
a prayer of renewal
in this fragile moment.


- Cecilia Vicuña
