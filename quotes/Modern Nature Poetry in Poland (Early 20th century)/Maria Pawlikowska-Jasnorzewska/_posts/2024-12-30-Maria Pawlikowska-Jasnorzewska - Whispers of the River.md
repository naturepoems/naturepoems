A river snakes through the valleys,
each ripple tells a story,
each twist a journey untold,
as it weaves its way,
serpent-like,
through the fabric of land and time.

The water speaks in whispers,
a language as ancient as the stones,
echoing the dreams of earth,
reminding me of my place,
within the flow of existence,
a mere drop in the vast sea.

Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska
