The trees are bare, the ground is cold,
Yet spring, with heart anew,
Shall break the frost, the ties of old,
And bloom in every hue.

For every bud shall find its place,
And promise life to come;
In nature’s beauty, we embrace,
The dawn of joy that’s won.

So let us laugh beneath the sun,
And dance ‘neath skies so blue;
For spring, my love, has just begun,
And all our dreams break through.

- Robert Burns
