The Wood-Pile
Out in the woods I have often wished 
To find a place unbothered by the noise,
Where trees stood tall, and the leaves existed
To dance and play in time's applause, 
And peace would build a nest about my heart.

But there among the pines, 
I came upon an old wood-pile note, 
Of slanting logs piled one upon the other,
Worn weary by time, but full of might, 
Still holding story in their grain—
Of how our lives were shaped like wood, 
And how we matched frail rot and sway.

Join me, old trees, for all that may have come to pass,
I will recall the beauty in your bark.

It's in the stillness of your breath,
That whispers out the stories of the night.

- Robert Frost
