The Meadow’s Edge
At the meadow’s edge, where wild things roam,
a tapestry woven with nature's thread,
where daisies and clovers find their home,
a vibrant life, where dreams are fed.

Butterflies flit in a dizzy ballet,
as sunlight spills on a verdant sea,
each moment a gift, a gentle display,
a sacred space where I’m meant to be.

In this haven of wild, I breathe in deep,
for here in the arms of the land, I’m free,
with nature’s love, my heart will keep,
a treasure trove of eternity.


- Thomas S P S Munch
