THE TREES

The trees stand tall against the sky,
Dressed in their foliage, alive and spry;
In summer’s warmth they joyfully sway,
While a gentle breeze sings through the day.

Their shadows dance upon the ground,
As nature whispers, and love is found.
Each leaf a story, each branch a song;
In their embrace, we all belong.  


- A E Housman
