Time is but a mountain’s shadow,
casting light on the restless stream.
I chase its ephemeral shimmer,
thinking of nothing, yet feeling
everything in the pulse of the great.

I breathe deep, absorbing the peace,
woven where silence meets the rush,
a tapestry of moments,
fibers of life in brilliant array.
