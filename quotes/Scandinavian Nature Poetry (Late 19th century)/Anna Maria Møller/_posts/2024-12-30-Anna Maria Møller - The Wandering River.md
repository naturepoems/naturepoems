The Wandering River

A ribbon of silver, winding free,
Through valleys deep and ancient trees,
Your song is carried on the breeze,
In every curve, the soul finds ease.

You carve the earth, with gentle might,
Reflecting stars on tranquil night,
In your depths, the past does flow,
In every current, the secrets grow.

With every bend, we follow along,
In nature’s arms, we find our song,
A journey shared, with you we drift,
In your embrace, the spirit lifts.


- Anna Maria Møller
