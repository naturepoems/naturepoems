By the Sea

On the bleak shore where the storm winds blow,
Where the gray waves clash with granite rocks,
I walk alone with thoughts that flow,
As the sea roars and time mocks.

The sun dips low, a sinking gold,
And whispers of twilight fill the air,
With the ocean's depths a story told,
Of love and loss, despair laid bare.

An endless horizon dips into night,
And stars awaken, glowing bright,
In the silence, shadows dance and sway,
As the sea remembers the light of day.

Oh, pulse of nature, wild and free,
In your embrace, I find my truth,
Unraveling the depths of mystery,
The sea, my companion, in eternal youth.

â€“ Nikolai Gumilyov
