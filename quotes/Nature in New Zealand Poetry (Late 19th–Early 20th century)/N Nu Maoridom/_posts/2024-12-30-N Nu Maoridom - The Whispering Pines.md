The Whispering Pines

Among the pines, where shadows dwell,
A secret world, a timeless spell,
In rustling leaves, the stories sigh,
Of earth and sky, in harmony lie.

With every breath the branches share,
A gentle wisdom floats in air,
In nature's bosom, softly spun,
I find the peace where I am one.

- N Nu Maoridom
