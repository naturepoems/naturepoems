quote: "Spring whispers softly through the fields,  
   as blossoms push through thawing earth,

Spring whispers softly through the fields,  
   as blossoms push through thawing earth,  
   a promise of life renewed.
    
   Bees buzz in playful arcs,  
   charting paths on fragrant wings,  
   the dance of pollen and bloom.

- Ezra Pound
