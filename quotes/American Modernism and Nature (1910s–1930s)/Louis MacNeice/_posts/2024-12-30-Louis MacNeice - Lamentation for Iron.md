Lamentation for Iron  

This field sunk down with weeds  
Is nothing thicker than the dirt;  
And the wandering breezes sift phi  
Among the single blades of grass  
Set towards the ring—the plow,  
Beautiful as silent flesh —  
Whispers heard across these wasted heavens  
Grove the laughter into her hold,  
'Then speak no more so bluntly, breezeless wind.'  

And I would pen marks with cold  
Against the armful of each field —  
Nearing sleep, but not quite yet,  
And let the dusk dis/emerge  
From hunger to ghostly pages down —  
Pride and passion; ghostly margins,  
Where the dancers grew withir —  
So silence takes rise again;  
This, our land swept back in time.

- Louis MacNeice
