The Forest Awaits

In the whisper of leaves,
In the rustle of grass,
The forest unfolds,
A sanctuary of peace,
Where nature cradles each thought.

The sunlight streams through,
Embracing the trunks,
While shadows dance lightly
Upon the soft earth,
A mosaic of life at rest.

Birdsongs pierce the silence,
A symphony of joy,
Echoing in the stillness,
Lingering like a soft breath,
A promise of the wild's embrace.

- Konstantīns Raudive
