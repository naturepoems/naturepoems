The mountains stand like sentinels,
Guarding the tales that silence tells,
Their peaks, a canvas kissed by light,
A glorious dance from day to night.

Each valley carved by time's embrace,
Holds stories of the human race,
In natureâ€™s vast and tender hold,
Our history, a tale retold.

- Anna Brigadere
