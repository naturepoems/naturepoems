Wanderer

A wanderer 'neath these ancient trees,
I trace the paths where shadows play;
The gentle whispers of the breeze,
Guide my heart along the way.

With every step, the earth awakes,
And life, in myriad forms, reprieves;
In nature's arms, my spirit shakes,
A dance that sways among the leaves.

Though time may steal and distance grow,
In nature's folds, my spirit thrives;
For here, beneath the sun’s soft glow,
I find the pulse of all our lives.

- Thomas Woolner
