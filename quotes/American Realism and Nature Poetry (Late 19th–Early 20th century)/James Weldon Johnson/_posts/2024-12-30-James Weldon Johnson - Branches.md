Branches

Branches stretch and bend,  
   In the dance of the calm night’s hush,  
   They cradle the stars, reflect the moon,  
   As the world surrenders to dusk.

Every limb a memory’s sigh,  
   Every leaf a dream that breathes free,  
   Life rustles softly, as time flutters by,  
   Under the vast and endless tree.
