The Influence of Nature
In the calm of a summer's day,  
When the winds slow in their play,  
How the heart doth yearn to feel,  
The touch of Nature’s gracious seal.

The valleys, deep as thought,  
Remind us what we sought;  
And in their shadows we retreat,  
To find life’s rhythm, oh so sweet.

- Felicia Hemans
