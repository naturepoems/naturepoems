Eternal Dawn

When the sun wakes from its deep sleep,
The world stirs slowly, no longer deep,
Golden rays kiss the earth anew,
Painting shadows in morning dew.

Each dawn a promise, each light a chance,
To walk in nature’s gentle dance,
In the symphony of day’s first light,
We find our peace, a heart’s delight.

- David C Okwuosa
