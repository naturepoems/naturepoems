A Quiet Reflection

Beneath the boughs, lost in thought,  
I ponder the stillness, the hum of the trees.  
Nature holds moments in delicate grasp,  
Each breath whispers through petals and leaves.
The brook flows gently, carrying old tales,  
While shadows dance in the golden light.  
For nestled here, away from the noise,  
I find peace in the fading night.
Let silence cradle our emerald dreams,  
For even in chaos, beauty remains—  
In the shelter of nature, my spirit revives,  
With every soft rustle, my heart finds its names.

—Bertolt Brecht
