The Moon

The moon ascends slowly in a silence so deep,
Casting silvered shadows, where night creatures creep.
With a steady gaze, she looks down on the earth,
Witness to dreams and the hush of rebirth.

Her light bathes the world in a soft, gentle glow,
Every ray a promise that time must bestow.
As night draws its curtain, I feel the pull's force,
Nature's own rhythm, guiding me of course.

- Edward Thomas
