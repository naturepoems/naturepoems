quote: "Under the branches where the light flows down,
In the breath of leaves, aged and tender,
I find the ancient rhythms returning,
Symphonies of rustling silence,
Birdsongs strung like pearls on morning air,
Each note an entwined history
Of sky, of root, of water's retreat."

Under the branches where the light flows down,
In the breath of leaves, aged and tender,
I find the ancient rhythms returning,
Symphonies of rustling silence,
Birdsongs strung like pearls on morning air,
Each note an entwined history
Of sky, of root, of water's retreat.
