The air is sweet with meadow grass,
   The fields are wrapt in dew.
   A thousand flowers that ne'er shall pass
   Drift on the morn anew.
   Where brook and foliage twist and twine
   The thrush sings in the tree,
   And in the blossoms rain divine
   A whisper comes to me.
   I find the joy of life is sweet,
   In every breath I draw;
   In laughterâ€™s echo, far and fleet,
   In every hidden law.

- Sarah Orne Jewett
