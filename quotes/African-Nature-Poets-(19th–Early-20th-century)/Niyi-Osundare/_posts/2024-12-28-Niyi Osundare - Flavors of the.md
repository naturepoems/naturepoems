Flavors of the Farm

In the fields that breathe,
Under the embrace of the sun,
Lies the promise of life,
In rows of green,
In the golden delight of corn,
And the dappled richness of yam.

Every harvest, an offering,
Each seed, a hope for tomorrow,
The earth cradles our toil,
Sustains the dance of hands and hearts,
And nourishes our spirit,
As we glean from her bounty,
Color and flavor mingling,
Creating a symphony of sustenance.

O bounteous land, I sing
Of your gifts, your nurturing hands,
Of the stories etched in soil,
Of the laughter shared under gathering clouds,
And the songs of kin gathering,
Round the fires of togetherness.
