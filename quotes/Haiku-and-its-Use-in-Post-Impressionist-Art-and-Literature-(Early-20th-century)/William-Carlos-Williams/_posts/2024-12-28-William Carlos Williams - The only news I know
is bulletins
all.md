quote: "The only news I know
is bulletins
all day

I know nothing
of the lives
of men.

But it is true
that I shall not
put my face
to the ground
for an answer."

The only news I know
is bulletins
all day

from immortality.

I know nothing
of the lives
of men.

But it is true
that I shall not
put my face
to the ground
for an answer.

- William Carlos Williams
