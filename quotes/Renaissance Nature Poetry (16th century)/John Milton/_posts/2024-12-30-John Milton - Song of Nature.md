A Book of Hymns for the Nativity, III
And now, the day is on the wane,
The sun slopes down its golden stair;
And shadows stretch across the plain,
And hide the trembling wild-flowers there. 
These Nature songs we sing aloud,
They rise to grace the evening air,
Our voices echo soft and proud,
In twilight’s tender, sweet compare. 

In every leaf a whisper glows,
In every brook a melody flows.
In vale and hill, in stream and glade,
Each breath we take, an act of aid. 
Yet in this beauty, we can trace,
The fingerprints of nature’s grace.

- John Milton
