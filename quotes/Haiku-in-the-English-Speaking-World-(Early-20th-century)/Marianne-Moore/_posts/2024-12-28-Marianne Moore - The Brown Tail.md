The Brown Tail Moth
   is ribboned, is gardened,
   is in the flickering
   of the evening wind;
   the brown tail moth
   is singing of
   the riches of its life's
   experiences,
   its simple dance,
   the way it hovers
   a moment, looking where it goes.
   The mottled brown,
   casually collecting
   the happiness of spring
   in the old elm leaves.
   It flaps its tiny wings,
   that have seen the sunâ€™s
   exact position.
   When dusk descends,
   rich color gleams
   in the desolate cheer
   of uncut grass...

- Marianne Moore
