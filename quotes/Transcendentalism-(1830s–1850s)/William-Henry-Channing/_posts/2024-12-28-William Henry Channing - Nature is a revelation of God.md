Nature is a revelation of God;  
Art is a shadow of God.  

The grandeur of your works, O Lord,  
Puts deep in the soul the spirit of the unknown,  
Filling the heart with humbleness and peace.  

When the sun rises over the quiet hills,  
And the mist lifts from the meadows tenderly,  
Life awakens in beauty and in grace,  
Stirring the spirit with softest harmonies.

- William Henry Channing
