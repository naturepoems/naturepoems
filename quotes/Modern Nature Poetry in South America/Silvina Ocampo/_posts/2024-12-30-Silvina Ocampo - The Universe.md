The Universe

In the vast uncertainty,
a tapestry unfolds
in silence,
where nature composes light
and shadow,
whispers of truths unseen.
A symphony emerges,
a conversation between stars,
the wind, and the rivers,
imbuing the night
with mysteries,
a lull to the sleepless earth,
a miracle of creation.
