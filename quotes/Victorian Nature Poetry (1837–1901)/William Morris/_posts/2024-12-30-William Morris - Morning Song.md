Through the meadows green and bright,
The sun shall rise in golden light;
And with an open heart shall sing,
In praise of every living thing.

And moistened by the morning dew,
The flowers shall burst their buds anew,
To greet the dawn, to greet the air,
With every fragrant blossom, fair.

- William Morris
