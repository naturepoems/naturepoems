Give Me the Gorgeous Summer

Give me the gorgeous summer, sung with brass,
To the gardens filled with green, to the pools of light,
The humming of bees, the laughter of children,
Every where your laughter resounds in joy!

In the dusk where the night picks its soft cloak,
The stars sing, shining through in the calmness,
And the moon draws us in luring like a flame
To the beauty of this gentle nighttime plane.


- Walt Whitman
