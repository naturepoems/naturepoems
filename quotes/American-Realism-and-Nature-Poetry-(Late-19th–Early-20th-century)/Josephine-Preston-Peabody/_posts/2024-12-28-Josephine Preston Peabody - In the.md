In the Woods

I stood upon a hill, and from the height
I saw the sun break through the stormy night,
And streams of light poured through the trees that grew
In wild disorder, leaning green and blue.

Around the world I walked and knew the trees
That bent above my head in gentle pleas,
And breathed the sweet and fragrant air that blew,
And caught the dance of leaves, and felt the dew.

I found the rivers sparkling in the sun,
Their silver ripples like a silver run,
And every little brook, a laughing heart,
Made music with the fields that knew no part.

Into the woods I wandered, lost in dreams,
And every songbird sang of hidden themes,
Till all the world was filled with light and peace,
And in my heart, a song that would not cease.
