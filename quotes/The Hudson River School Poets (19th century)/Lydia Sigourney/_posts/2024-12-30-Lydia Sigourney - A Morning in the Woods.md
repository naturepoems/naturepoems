A Morning in the Woods

The forest wakes, in softest light,  
A hush enfolds the trees,  
In every branch, and bird in flight,  
The peace of morning breathes.

The brook sings sweet, beneath the shade,  
While sunlight weaves through leaves,  
And natureâ€™s arms, so gently laid,  
Wrap all who there believe.

In quiet reverence, I walk along,  
In every breath of dew-drenched air,  
With grateful heart, to thee I song,  
O tranquil woods, beyond compare!

- Lydia Sigourney
