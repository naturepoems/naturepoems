author: Futurist Poet
quote: "Mirroring skies on the lake below,
Reflecting the madness of ebb and flow.
In the stillness, chaos finds its muse,
A fusion of worlds, where nothing’s to lose.

Gusts of wind paint stories uncaged,
Ideas unleashed, art now staged.
In every leaf, a tale is spun,
In the wild labyrinth, wisdom won."

Mirroring skies on the lake below,
Reflecting the madness of ebb and flow.
In the stillness, chaos finds its muse,
A fusion of worlds, where nothing’s to lose.

Gusts of wind paint stories uncaged,
Ideas unleashed, art now staged.
In every leaf, a tale is spun,
In the wild labyrinth, wisdom won.
