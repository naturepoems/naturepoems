The Sound of Trees

When the trees rustle,
I listen,
Ears open to the wind's whisper,
To the leaves' secrets.
Windswept their stories
Of seasons gone,
Of birds that built their nests,
Of shadows on the land.
I hear the grinding bark
Of ancient trunks,
The sighing roots,
Plunging deep into earth,
Holding hands with clay, stone,
And the pulse of the planet.

O silver-tongued witnesses,
You speak of the song of silence,
Of rain that danced on your holes,
Of sun that warmed every crevice.
Just hearing your heartbeats,
I become one with your shade,
One with the swaying,
The weaving,
The wisdom of your being.

Let me breathe your breath,
O symbol of endurance,
O monument of hope.

- Niyi Osundare
