In the quiet woods of cedar tall,
Where the gentle breezes play,
Life speaks in whispers to us all,
As the light begins to sway.

The timid deer, they tread so light;
The songs of birds begin to soar;
In every sound, in every sight,
The beauty calls us to explore.

Let heart and soul take time to roam,
To find in nature's vast expanse,
That here we may discover home,
And share in life's sweet, joyful dance.

- Hannah More
