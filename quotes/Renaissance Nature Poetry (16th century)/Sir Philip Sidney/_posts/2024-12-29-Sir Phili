Can there be sweeter solace than the tree,
With shelter provided, and shade flowing free?
Beside its roots my thoughts take flight and frame,
A hallowed reverie, a gentle claim.

With leaves a-whisper, and branches that sway,
I hear the echoes of the softest day.
So let me rest awhile, in Nature’s fold,
For in her arms, my spirit feels consoled.

Her gifts, both vast and simple, pour like rain,
In every flower blooms, in every grain,
And, with the twilight’s zephyr, I recline,
In her immortal bosom, I entwine.

- Sir Philip Sidney
