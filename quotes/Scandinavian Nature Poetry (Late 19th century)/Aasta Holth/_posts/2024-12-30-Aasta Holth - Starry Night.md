Starry Night
Beneath the vast and starry sky,
The world unfolds in cosmic grace,
Each star a dream, each whisper why,
In nature's gaze, we find our place.

Light years from earthly tethered woes,
We dance with constellations bright,
In the silence, wonder grows,
Awake, alive in the starry night.

- Aasta Holth
