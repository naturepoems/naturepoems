Autumn Song

In the quiver of leaves, secrets sigh,  
Whispers of autumn as soft winds fly;  
With colors bold and fading now,  
The earth dons her mantle, a golden brow.

Days drown in shades of amber delight,  
The sun sculpts magic through the waning light;  
Yet in this beauty, a tender ache,  
The heart feels heavy, as shadows awake.

Sing the song of what was before,  
In each vibrant hue, memories explore;  
Fall is a mirror, of lifeâ€™s sweet decay,  
Yet leads us to spring in a curious way.

- Charles Baudelaire
