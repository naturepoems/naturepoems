In the silence of the forest deep,
Where sunlight dances, shadows sweep,
The whispering leaves tell tales of old,
Of secrets buried, of treasures untold.

Among the pines, the soft wind sighs,
A melody sweet beneath the skies,
With every breath, the earth awakes,
In harmony, the soul it takes.


- Tora L Ruge
