The Soul has Bandaged moments –  
When too ethereal Care  
Goes to the wind – a Sensation  
That Longing can prepare –  

'Tis not that we are fickle –  
Or heedless to a Thought –  
It is mankind's Affection  
That falls on Nature – sought –  

And Feathers where the Waters  
While wandering Cups, retain  
So Tufts, and Notes that tremble  
With all beyond the Plane –  

But still – the timorous Passage  
Makes us crave to look afar –  
In flecks of Beauty’s Garden -  
To break the walls of War –

- Emily Dickinson
