Golden Days

Golden days are rolling by,
In the colors of the golden hues,
As the swift lives of the river fly,
Under skies awash with morning blues.

For each bit of laughter places me,
On the triggers of waltz, rolling fate;
Between fields of dreams, where the happy roam free,
And the hope of the spirit flows so straight.

So gather up moments and take your fill,
As the sun weaves gentle ruddiness delight,
For the spirit of nature’s if strong and still,
To eat from the hour that shimmers bright!

With joys embroidered in whispers near,
As we stand beneath the silver trees,
Only to wrap hope in together cheer –
Golden days shall draw upon us, please!

- Banjo Paterson
