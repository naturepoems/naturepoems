Waves like"

quote: "The sea vast and unbroken,
Waves like thoughts not yet declared,
Each crest a moment, rising and falling,
Caressed by the breeze, in tune with the sky,
An infinite echo of silence and sound."

The sea vast and unbroken,
Waves like thoughts not yet declared,
Each crest a moment, rising and falling,
Caressed by the breeze, in tune with the sky,
An infinite echo of silence and sound.
