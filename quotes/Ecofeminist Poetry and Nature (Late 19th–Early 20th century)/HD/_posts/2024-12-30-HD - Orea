Oread

Whirl up, sea—
whirl your pointed pines,
strike in the sky
  the sea-splintered pines,
  with a crash of wind,
  and a crush of lifting
of mist from the ground.

Whirl up, sea—
whirl your pointed pines.

The tectonic lids of the land
shudder and retreat.

The spouts of the silver sea,
    leaping as giants,
      smiting the sky,
        strike in the sky

and the bright of the storm.
The bright of the sea
  falls and crushes
    the spires of the winds—

whirl up, whirl up
  your sea, O pines—

whirl up, whirl up,
    strike in the sky.

H.D.
