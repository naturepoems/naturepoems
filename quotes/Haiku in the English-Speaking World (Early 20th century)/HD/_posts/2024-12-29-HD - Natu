Lush green leaves,
nature's gentle hands
caressing the earth,
whispering softly,
"I am alive, I am alive!"
The sun breaks through,
in rays of golden light
that bathe my skin
and bring me peace.
Flowers bloom,wild and free.
Their fragrance fills the air,
a symphony of color,
pure and bright,
calling to the heart.
Nature speaks,
with language profound,
reminding us
of all that is sacred.
Let us listen,
take a breath,
and become one
with the earth.
