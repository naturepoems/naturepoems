---

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,  
But I have promises to keep,  
And miles to go before I sleep,  
And miles to go before I sleep.  

The trees are singing me into the night,  
They are my friends, that soft light  
Of the moon and the breathing of leaves  
Years pass quietly, like the rustling of sleeves.  


- Walt Whitman
