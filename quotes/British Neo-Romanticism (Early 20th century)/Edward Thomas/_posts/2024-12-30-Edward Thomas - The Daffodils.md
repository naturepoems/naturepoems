The daffodils

The daffodils lift their heads in a row,
Like soldiers bold, in gleaming show,
With petals bright, in morning’s grace,
Waking softly in the sun’s embrace.

Gentle breezes weave through gold,
The whispers of spring, a tale retold,
Amongst the fields where nature sings,
Each bloom a herald of brighter things.

In clusters gathered, they greet the day,
With cheer and laughter in their play,
For fleeting moments, they bloom so bright,
Reminders of warmth, of love, of light.

So here’s to daffodils standing tall,
With open hearts, they answer the call,
In every wake, they whisper spring,
A sacred joy that life shall bring.

- Edward Thomas
