When the dusk drapes her velvet cloak,
And stars awaken from their dreams,
I listen to the night’s soft pulse,
In the stillness, the body redeems.

Each heartbeat a symphony plays,
Where moonlight spills upon the ground,
Binding the earth with threads of silver,
In nature’s arms, I am found.

- Laura Riding Jackson
