Echoes of the Sky

In the morning light,
the sky holds us above,
a great expanse of hope,
where dreams float like clouds,
endless and free,
singing the blue notes of the universe,

the sun spills gold,
a warm embrace for the earth,
removing the chill of dreams,
steady rhythms of hearts
beaten in time with the wind’s sigh.

In this canvas,
where every color sings,
the echo of our laughter stirs,
reminding us how life pulses,
woven in threads of love,
of joy, of the sacred,

and in the silence after,
at the edge of day,
we find our words,
a prayer to the skies,
for they always hold us,
ear to the heavens,
where we rise and fall together,
in this grand mosaic of light.
