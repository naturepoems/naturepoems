Lake in Summer

The lake shines bright and smooth,
Upon the face of lands unknown,
    Who would dare to say
  What speaks within its silence?
Yet the lone sun begs inherit,
Seeks contact as it dies;

And yet my heart will sing,
Caught in light's embrace,
Brings forth a work from beauty,
Unfolding tides and joyful mirrors.
For I am but a wandering child.

—Henry David Thoreau
