The brook descends through valleys deep,
Reflecting skies, clear and wide,
In its cool embrace, the creatures leap,
The pulse of Earth—a gentle tide.
A canopy of stars above,
In twinkling lights, soft shadows play,
And in the heart, there blooms a love,
In nature’s warmth, we find our way.
Each leaf that whispers in the breeze,
Each flower that bends with grace,
Unveils the beauty of what sees,
In nature’s ever-embraced space.


- Elizabeth Barrett Browning
