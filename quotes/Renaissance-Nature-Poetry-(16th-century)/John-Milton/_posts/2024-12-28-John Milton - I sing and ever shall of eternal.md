I sing, and ever shall, of eternal things;
Lifeâ€™s wisest depths, of Heaven's bounty, 
The secrets lost in angel-music rings,
What Nature owes to God, to Love and Beauty.
Their dance, in time with Nature's gentle veins, 
A harmony of the earth's rich, vibrant lore.
A joyful noise, where every note remains,
A reflection of that one celestial score.

- John Milton
