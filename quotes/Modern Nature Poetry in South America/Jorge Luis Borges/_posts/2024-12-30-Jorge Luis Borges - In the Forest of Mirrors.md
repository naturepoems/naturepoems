In the Forest of Mirrors

The forest reflects,
A myriad of images unseen,
Quiet fantasies and echoes
Carried on the breath of time.

Here, the trees wear whispers,
Their trunks speak in codes,
Each leaf a mirror,
Reflecting the pulse of the earth.

In the symphony of silence,
I find my soul entwined
With the very essence of being,
A dance of natureâ€™s melody.


- Jorge Luis Borges
