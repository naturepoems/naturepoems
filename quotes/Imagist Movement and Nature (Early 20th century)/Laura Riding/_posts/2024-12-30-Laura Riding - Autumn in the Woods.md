The trees were glorious
In a disarray of color,
Each bough lowered with the weight
Of an autumn delirium—
Hedge and shrub fruit-studded, joyous,
All that was left of summer
Mingle in the day’s dimness, and,
Borrowing from this deeper purple,
Time fruitless dribbles into night. 
A hush generous as monsoon,
In the wildest summer air,
Will stand with them on this green edge—
All but silence in the tree’s movement.

A flickering leaf breaks silence.— 
Ever, a murmurous design, ever
Life exists, elusive and ephemeral,
The scattered leaves spiral to the ground—
Softened by the falling sun and its orange in the sky.
