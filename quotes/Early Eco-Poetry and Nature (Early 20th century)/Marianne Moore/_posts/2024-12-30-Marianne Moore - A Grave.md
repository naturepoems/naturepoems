A Grave

Long ago, we were half
     invented among the
     trees, like keeping a
     watch over green.
     It might not have been
     if I had never gone.
     A reverie could spring
     irrigation with bondsâ€”
     for air-talkers, height is
        diminished and protrusions
             give it plot.
