The Pond
by Robert Lowell

In the silent woods,  
a pond rests under trees  
like a child asleep;  
the surface reflects  
the quiet of the sky,  
not disturbed by a single breeze.

Surrounded by green ferns,  
the water gleams like glass,  
it holds the world above  
in perfect stillness,  
as diaphanous as memory  
in the troubled heart. 

Here nature is complete,  
a tranquil gem,  
untouched by time's decay,  
it carries the wear of sighs,  
forever in the green retreat  
in the heart of the woods.

- Robert Lowell
