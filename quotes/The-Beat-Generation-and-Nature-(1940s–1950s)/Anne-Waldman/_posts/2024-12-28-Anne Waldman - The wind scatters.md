The wind scatters tales,
shifts levels of air,
earth found in the moment,
fluctuating between trees,
no past to worry,
just this rumble,
this pulse,
in the skin of the universe.

The call came softly;
a reverberation from within,
quiet to the seasoned,
stronger in the youth’s intuition,
every creature participating,
I follow the paths,
seek colors in darkness,
tread upon all roots.


- Anne Waldman
