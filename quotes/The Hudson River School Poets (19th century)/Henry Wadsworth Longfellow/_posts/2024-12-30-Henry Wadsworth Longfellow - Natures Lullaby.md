The happy day is ended,  
And silence reigns, tranquil bliss.
The ties that Nature tended  
Shall hold us close in nightâ€™s sweet kiss.

The mountain sleeps, the valleys sigh,  
The moon unfolds her gentle glow,
And in the heath's wild blooms, we lie,  
As time bestows its sacred flow.


- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
