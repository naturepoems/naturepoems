Awaken, oh dormant seeds!
Break through the frozen ground,
For the sun is a burning hope,
That melts the frost of despair.
Each sprout, a testament to life,
Refusing to surrender,
To the silence of the winterâ€™s grasp.

With every bloom, a declaration,
A riot of colors,
Drenched in the essence of dreams,
Spring dances joyously,
A heartbeat across the landscape,
Alive, exuberant, fierce.

I cradle these tender blossoms,
An ode to resilience,
In their vulnerability,
Lies the strength of existence,
For nature reminds us,
To rise and meet the light.

In this cycle of rebirthing,
I see the reflections of us all,
Tangible and raw,
Echoes of what we become,
In the face of the changing seasons,
Ever unyielding, ever enduring.

- Ettore Cozzani
