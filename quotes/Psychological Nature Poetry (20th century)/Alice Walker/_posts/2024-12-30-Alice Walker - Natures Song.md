The flowers
are the flesh of the earth.
The leaves are its hair.
A bird’s song is the laugh
of the spirit, and
in the river’s shallow flow
is the soul of the world.

How can we forget
we are of this beauty?
We must be not only a moment,
but a part of the whole. 

To kiss the soil,
to drink in the rain,
we become a harmony,
a dream of life.


- Alice Walker
