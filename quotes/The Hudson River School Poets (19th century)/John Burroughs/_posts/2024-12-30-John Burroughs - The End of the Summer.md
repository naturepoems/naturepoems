The End of the Summer

The summer’s end is upon us now,
The leaves begin to turn,
The air is crisp, the breeze a vow,
That soon the woodlands will burn.

Golden and crimson the trees stand tall,
Each a testament to time’s gentle sway,
Nature’s painting, a beautiful call,
To celebrate the waning day.

As the sun dips below the hills,
And the stars start to twinkle in sight,
I give thanks for the summer’s thrills,
And embrace the coming of night.

- John Burroughs
