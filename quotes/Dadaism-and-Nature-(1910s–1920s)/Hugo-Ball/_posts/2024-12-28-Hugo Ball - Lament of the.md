Lament of the Stars

Oh silent witnesses watch,
The earth spins in beautiful chaos,
Stars scattered like wildflowers,
In gardens of the cosmos,
Each pulse trembles through night,
In secret rituals of light.

They sing in hush and thrum,
In whispers woven of dreams,
Where the moon speaks to the sea,
In echoes of longing hearts,
The vastness chokes the breath,
Yet stirs in the dark a warmth.


- Hugo Ball
