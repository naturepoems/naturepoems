A SPRING MORNING

Awake! The morning breaks with sweet delight,  
Where flowers blush and play in soft embrace,  
The world renews as sun-kissed gives its light,  
Where every breath speaks of a tender grace.  
A spring morning unfolding time and space,  
In harmony, the earth does gently sing,  
With rustling trees and breezes that interlace,  
Oh joy of spring the heart shall ever bring!


- Walter Deverell
