Whispers of the Wind
In the silent woods, I tread,
Where whispered breezes softly spread.
The trees they sway, a rhythmic dance,
As nature sings, in a gentle trance.

Each leaf a story, each branch a song,
In the heart of the forest, where I belong.
The sun peeks through, a golden ray,
Igniting the world at the break of day.

- Kwame Nkrumah
