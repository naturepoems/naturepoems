I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear;  
Those of mechanics—the carpenter,  
The mason, and the boatman—the shoemaker,  
The wood-cutter, and the ploughboy,  
Each one singing his as it should be, blithe and strong;  
The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,  
The mason singing his as he makes ready for work,  
The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat,  
The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench,  
The wood-cutter's song—the ploughboy's on his way in the morning,  
Or at noon intermission or at sundown,  
Or at early in the evening, or silently during the day.

- Walt Whitman
