The wind is tossing the leaves
 On the trees at the edge of the night.
 The sunset feels its way.
 Can you hear the whispering waves?
 Can you hear the water making love to the sea?
 The heart listens,
 And the world turns, turns, turns.
 Give me the wings of the evening.
 Give me the grappling roots of the earth.

- Carl Sandburg
