A whisper through the autumn trees,
The scent of earth that fills the breeze.
Golden leaves like blessings shared,
Remind me living is to be dared.

In nature's lap, all burdens cease,
With every step, I find my peace.
The harmony of the woods resides,
In every leaf, my spirit glides.


- Zora Neale Hurston
