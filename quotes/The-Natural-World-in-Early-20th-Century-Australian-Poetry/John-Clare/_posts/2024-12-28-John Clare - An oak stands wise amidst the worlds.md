An oak stands wise, amidst the world’s wide breath,
Its gnarled limbs hold secrets of the past,
Survivor of the storms, defying death,
In whispered tales, the roots are anchored fast.

Around its base, the wildflowers convene,
In celebration of the sun's warm glow,
A rainbow’s dance, in hues so bright, serene,
Awakening the dreams of earth below.

Here, in this sacred space of stillness found,
The heart of nature beats in quiet grace,
In every leaf that gently sweeps the ground,
The echoes of eternity embrace.

- John Clare
