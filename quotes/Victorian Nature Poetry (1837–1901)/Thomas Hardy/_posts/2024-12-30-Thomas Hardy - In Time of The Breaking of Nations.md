In Time of 'The Breaking of Nations'

Only a man harrowing clods
In a slow silent walk, 
And behind him, with a loitering tread,
A crippled soul in the talk.

Fighting for care, till a silence grows,
In the souls of a moving land,
And a distant yet splendored comatose,
Lies beneath this proud demand.

But anon on the edge where a soft breeze calls,
I feel her breath like the sun.
I know that the heart of nature never stalls,
But welcomes each day as one.

- Thomas Hardy
