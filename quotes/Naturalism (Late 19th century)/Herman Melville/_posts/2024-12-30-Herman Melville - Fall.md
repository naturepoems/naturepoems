Fall  
   
In autumn's blush, the leaves descend,  
A tapestry of gold and brown,  
The whispers of the winds extend,  
As nature dons her royal crown.  
  
In gentle light, the daylight fades,  
Upon the hills, the shadows play,  
In fields where daylight softly wades,  
The plush of harvest turns to gray.  
  
Yet in this time of soft decay,  
Resides the promise of the spring,  
For all the hues of fall will lay  
The groundwork for new life to bring.

- Herman Melville
