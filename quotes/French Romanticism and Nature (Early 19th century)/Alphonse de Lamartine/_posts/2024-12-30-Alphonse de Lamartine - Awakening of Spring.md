Awakening of Spring

The first soft ray, a golden kiss,  
Upon the buds that stir from sleep;  
In every glade, a promise bliss,  
Where’er the gentle blossoms leap.

The crocus peeks, the daffodils dance,  
In fields that stretch with colors bright;  
Nature awakens in a trance,  
To banish winter’s chilly night.

O Spring! You bring the world anew,  
In each soft breeze, and every hue;  
In the hearts of men, your spirit flows,  
To paint our souls with life’s own prose.

- Alphonse de Lamartine
