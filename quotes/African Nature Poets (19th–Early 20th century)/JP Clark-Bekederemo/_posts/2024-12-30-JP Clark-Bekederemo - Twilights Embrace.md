The sky unfolds at sunset,
A canvas brushed with fire,
With hues of red and orange,
That stir the soul’s desire.

As day gives way to twilight,
And stars begin to shine,
Nature wraps us in its arms,
With a love both fierce and divine.

So let us watch the heavens,
And breathe in this delight,
For in the beauty of the world,
We find our peace tonight.
