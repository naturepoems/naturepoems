With the dusk closing gently around us and near,
As the shadows grow longer, and the stars begin here;
There’s a stillness, a quiet, that blankets the night,
And the world holds its breath, as we await the light.

For the whispers of day sum to echoes of peace,
And the beauty of twilight brings our worries to cease;
Let us linger in silence and behold what we see,
In the cradle of nature, where we’re completely free.
