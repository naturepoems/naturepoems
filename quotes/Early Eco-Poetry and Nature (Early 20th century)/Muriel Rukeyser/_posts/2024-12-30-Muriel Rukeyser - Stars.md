Stars are the rubble in the world,
glittering from the hills of our lives.
But they pulse, these hurtling stars,
through black silence; rangy and thick with light,
they straighten between our hands,
clutching on our wrists,
filling our lungs.

I lean,
held by the earths whisper,
the weight of this chaos is my breath:
a tree bends towards the trees,
singing mysteries to deep knowing,
among changing notes of a live wire,
our bodies touch tonight.
