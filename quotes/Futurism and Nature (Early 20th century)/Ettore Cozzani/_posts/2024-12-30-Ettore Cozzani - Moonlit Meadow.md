Moonlight bathes the meadow,
A silver veil spread wide,
And in the stillness of the night,
Dreams drift on the midnight breeze.

Crickets serenade the stars,
Natureâ€™s soft lullaby,
While fireflies light the dark,
Dancing like spirits alive.

This tranquil scene, a canvas
Where shadows paint their tales,
A realm untouched by the rush,
Bestowing peace upon the heart.

Here, amongst the wildflowers,
I find whispers of eternity,
Moments suspended in silence,
A sanctuary of the soul.

- Ettore Cozzani
