The wild wind speaks,
In rustling grass,
In crashing waves,
It carries tales of the ocean,
Adventure striding forth,
To where the horizon meets the stars,
In the twilight hours,
With the fate of ships and seafarersâ€”
A relentless pursuit,
Through storms and calm, the heart of Nature.

- Evelyn Scott
