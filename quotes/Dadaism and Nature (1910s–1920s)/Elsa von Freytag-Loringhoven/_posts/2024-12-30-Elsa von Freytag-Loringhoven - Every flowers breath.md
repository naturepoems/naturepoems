Every flower’s breath,
   creeps forth like
   muted screams from the
   undulating loam.
   Pink poles ascend vast
   auras, & curls --
   the silk of jest upon
   my cheek.
   The night nibbles,
   so sweetly upon
   distilled roots,
   as darkness cloaks
   the spirit’s mirth.

- Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven
