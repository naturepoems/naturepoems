The Hexameter

I roam in the sun, my darling;  
The tree has taken on a shade  
In its bosom where the sun shines,
And around me the birds are playing their finest tunes!  
But even sunshine sends its pains,  
And the autos, in earnest flight.  
For see you not how beauty falls?  
Oh, how the air and all below return.  


- Matthew Arnold
