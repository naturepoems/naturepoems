The Hours of Day
The hours of the day unfold,
as crickets sing their dusk,
every shadow beckoning home,
every breeze a comforting kiss—
as an owl whispers deep,
revealing dreams anew.

Night stands still,
a blanket curling tight,
as fireflies dance,
mapping through the dark;
every star, a memory,
and the earth,
welcoming dreams,
inviting us in.
