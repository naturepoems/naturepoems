A Bird came down the Walk –  
He did not know I saw –  
He bit an Angleworm in halves  
And ate the fellow, raw –  

And then he drank a Dew  
From a convenient Grass –  
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall  
To let a Beetle pass –  

He glanced with rapid eyes  
That hurried all around –  
They looked like frightened Beads, I thought –  
He stirred his Velvet Head –  

Like one in danger, Cautious  
I offered him a Crumb –  
And he unrolled his feathers  
And rowed them down the Elm –  

Then he floated away  
On the ground – and I  
Disrobed in a quiet moment  
Personal as it was –  


- Emily Dickinson
