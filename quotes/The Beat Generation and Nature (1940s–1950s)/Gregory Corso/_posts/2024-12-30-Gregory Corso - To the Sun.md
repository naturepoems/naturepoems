To the Sun
by Gregory Corso

When the sun
dips low
like a great hooker,
bringing tunes
of exotic places
i can tongue off the light
that opens everything like
a spoiled pearl.
The sun is a magician,
a priest in stain,
it unlocks chambers
and knocks again.
When I wake
and strip off my colony
drunk with exhaustion,
the sun arrives,
a touch on the cheek,

- I am outside,
becoming a thousand
crazy things 
that dance around
in the burning wind.
Everything gets simple,
every face is rape
of beauties unpolished,
every dormant head: melting
because sunlight ties
to my open hands?
I protest, say nothing,
this is the poem
and I suck it all, 
call again, call us.

What miracle it is!

- Gregory Corso
