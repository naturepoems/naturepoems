Hayfield

The sweet exhaust of the mowing
lies golden across the field,
where shadows waver, giving way
to whispers of laughter across the green.
homes made warm embrace without bounds,
time flows over alongside dreams
as the sickle cuts the tears of daylight,
anoise rising in the blades’ songaling hush,
leaving the trace of the open come.
Pitched well among the earth,
a breath turns fresh, captures flow,
yearning solace from the darkening sky,
to curl up again, cities that slide
into the evening’s tight embrace.
