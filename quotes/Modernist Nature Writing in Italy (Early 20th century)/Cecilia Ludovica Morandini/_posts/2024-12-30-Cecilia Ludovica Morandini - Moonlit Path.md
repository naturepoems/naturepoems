Moonlit Path

Underneath the silver glow,
a path unfurls before us,
each step a dance between shadows,
as the moon weaves light through branches.
Night blossoms with soft radiance,
painting the world with serenity,
every star a guide,
every breeze a gentle touch.

Here, under this celestial canopy,
a stillness breathes a promise,
a journey into the depths,
a connection to all that is,
as we walk hand in hand with night.

- Cecilia Ludovica Morandini
