The Peace of Wild Things

I go among the trees and sit still.  
     All my thoughts,  
     my worries  
     about the world,  
     fall away like the leaves  
     from the branches.  
     I watch as the winds fill  
     the spaces for a moment,  
     hear the birds sing  
     sweetly in the branches,  
     and feel the peace of wild thingsâ€”  
     the grass that bows and stretches,  
     the shadows lengthening down the path.  
     It is in this moment  
     that I remember:  
     there is not just the chaos;  
     there is also this giant world,  
     and in the quiet, I belong.

- Mary Oliver
