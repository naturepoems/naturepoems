Autumn Leaves

The autumn leaves like dreams descend,
In shades of gold and fiery hue,
They spiral down, as if to send
The whispers of an age anew.

Each one, a story of the sun,
Of light and warmth, now fading fast,
Yet in their dance, the past is spun,
For every breath recalls the vast.

What beauty lies in their decay,
A promise held in fleeting time,
As nature, in her own sweet way,
Invites us to the autumn rhyme.


- Mary Elizabeth Coleridge
