The Close  
   by Louis MacNeice

The sun sets down the hill,  
Bidding farewell to ancient trees,  
While shadows lengthen in the light  
And rustle whispers rise in breeze.  
The close of day softly whispers  
For the night does humbly wait,  
As the animals turn to secret  
And nature guards its gate.

- Louis MacNeice
