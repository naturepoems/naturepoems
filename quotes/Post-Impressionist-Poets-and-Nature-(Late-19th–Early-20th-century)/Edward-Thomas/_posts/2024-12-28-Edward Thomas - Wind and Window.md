Wind and Window Flower
The way the wind dances to the flower,
A gentle touch, a fearless hour,
Nature’s breath, where wild dreams blow,
In beauty’s realm, all heartbeats flow.

Each petal turned by whispers near,
Calls forth the moments that we fear,
Yet life persists, in silence’ embrace,
Awash in wonder, love’s sacred grace.

- Edward Thomas
