The Meadow

I.
In the  quiet hour of  dawn,
Where the dew bespeaks the morn;
I wander through the blades of grass,
Lost in thoughts of hours that pass.

II.
The wild flowers dance along the street,
As the sun begins to beat;
Among each blossom sweetly blooms,
The richness of the wild perfume.

III.
Then new life awakens tenderly,
Crickets chirp in ecstasy;
As I watch, my heart expands,
For all nature truly understands.

- Robert Buchanan
