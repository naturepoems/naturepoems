The Mountains of California

The mountains are calling, and I must go;
And I will work on while I can,
Studying the rocks and trees, the skies,
Ot this ways and that,
Tracking the sun’s eternal arc.

The forests are my first love,
The secret treasures I shall find,
Among the thickets and the crags,
In every wildflower blooming,
And every brook cascading down.

Ah! The joy of self-discovery,
By nature’s hand fashioned anew,
With every step, freedom beckons,
And there’s magic in the air,
While the mountains whisper to my soul.

- John Muir
