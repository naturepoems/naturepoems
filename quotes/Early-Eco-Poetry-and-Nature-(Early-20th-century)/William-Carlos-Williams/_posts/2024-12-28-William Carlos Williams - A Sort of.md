A Sort of Song

Let the snake wait

under his weed,

and the writing

on the sky

dissolve.

Let me see you

as you are,

unfurling

your colors

to the sky.

It is the moment

when the colors

are boundless,

and we take

no stock

of our presence

but merge,

becoming the things

of this earth.

- William Carlos Williams
