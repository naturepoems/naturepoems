The Call of the Wild
In forests dense where shadows creep,
The wild calls out through leaves and stone,
In nature’s heart, our spirits leap,
In every breath, we find a home.

A rustle here, a distant howl,
The essence of the untamed land,
In wild embrace, we lose the fowl,
In freedom’s arms, together we stand.

- Aldona Gustava
