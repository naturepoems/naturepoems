The Swamp

Where the moist earth yields so disinclined,
A murky quietude flows, deeply enshrined;
From tangled reeds rise shadows unbound,
While evening shrouds it in a breathless sound.

The water reflects pale, penetrating eyes,
Dancing by the lily pads, where longing lies;
Beneath the surface love's dreams do arise,
In the dim twilight, crows pass under sighs.

Murmurs of waterbirds plead the night,
While time rests its head upon the damp white;
Here in this quiet bog, life finds its own,  
In the stillness - hearts collectively moan.

- Alexandre Blok
