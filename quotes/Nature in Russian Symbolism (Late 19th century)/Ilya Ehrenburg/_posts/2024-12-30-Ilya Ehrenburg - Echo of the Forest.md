Echo of the Forest
Within the woods, a timeless song,
Resonates in branches high;
Each echo strong, where hearts belong,
Reminds us of love’s endless tie.

The trunks stand guard, so wise and old,
Their stories etched in bark and time;
In every leaf, a tale is told,
Of nature’s love, a perfect rhyme.

- Ilya Ehrenburg
