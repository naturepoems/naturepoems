The flowers of evil

Like the heart of a flower multiplied and worn,  
Among the alien stars I feel my own  
And know thy laughter awaits me,  
In the depths of thine eyes,  
A shining bead of dew,  
That shines in the curve of my lotus-seed,  
And imbues my blood with your moisture continue,

Here, oh blossoms, let us sing!  
Let the breezes hear the lute  
And in the pleasure of the dancing blooms,  
We will overflow as rivers!


- Charles Baudelaire
