Fragments of a Dream

In misty valleys veiled,
a fleeting breath stirs,
dreams linger between worlds,
a quiet dance of shadows.

Natureâ€™s brush strokes
paint the landscape,
each hue a memory,
a story waiting in the breeze.

Between mountains and sky,
time ceases to exist,
as whispers run through the trees,
a symphony of life.

In the midst of chaos,
a glimmer of hope,
a reminder that within
each fragment,
there lies a world,
a heartbeat,
a connection.
