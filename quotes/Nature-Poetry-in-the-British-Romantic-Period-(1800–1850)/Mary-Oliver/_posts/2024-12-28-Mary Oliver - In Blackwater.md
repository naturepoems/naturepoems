In Blackwater Woods
Look, the trees
are turning their own bodies
into pillars of light,
are giving off the rich fragrance
of cinnamon and fulfillment,
a blessing for the whole day long.
For the sake of this, I will not be lured
by any half-hearted feeling of guilt.
I will let it go loose, I will let it go wide,
a new day is coming with the winter’s moon,
each moment poised in stillness
in the eye of the wind.

- Mary Oliver
