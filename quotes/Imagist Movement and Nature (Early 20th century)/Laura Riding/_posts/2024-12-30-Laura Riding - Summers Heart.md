Yet I look in vain for the heart of summer; 
Its mid-day wonder veils the sky’s overtones,
The tangible splendor that’s not the same at dusk—
Beneath the hot breath of noon lie;
The flowered breath upon this earth, its shining, green graces,
And when I fail, then I dream of nature—
Abandoned by the pageant of light, a sound louder than silence; 
All the radiant stands that stand beneath,
Ending in bright intensity of substance only, and again,
Goodness is not the golden approach,
But things that lose their light. 
As I am left.
