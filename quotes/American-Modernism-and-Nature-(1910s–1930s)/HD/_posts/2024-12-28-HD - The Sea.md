The Sea Lily

O fallen star, 
you glow in the shadow 
of the sea lily: 
a glory; a triumphant mercy.
Glimmering in waters
light, refined.
Sailing on the surface
of the shadow world, 
your Essence, your sweet Death
bequeath me the sum of 
self.

Hoops in the drift, 
a folding of sea,
each shining, shining,
each opening, by the sea.
