The Wild Old Wicked Man
The wild old wicked man
Sat where the branches break
And the twilight flow of the lake
Like a whisper round the tree.
He took the hand of a little girl
And lightly called her name
And told her tales of the old enchantment game.

Let me take your hand, little girl,
I will lead you to the wood,
I'll lead you to the floor of the night,
Where the moon know not the great sea's flood.

The wild old wicked man
Willed for glory to appear
And takes her hand of silence,
To return to innocence is near.

- William Butler Yeats
