I seek the great good,
If we are to bloom,
There are hills of beauty,
And valleys of sweet peace.

The tender grass,
Awakens in spring,
In harmony with heaven,
Whispering promises.

Brooks gently murmur,
Caressing stones quickened,
Losing themselves in sweet depths,
Shattering in laughter, it seems.

The bending trees,
Their blooms on high,
They spread their arms
To the sun’s delight.

Oh, give in to nature’s breeze,
Dance upon the stars,
Awake the spirit of bliss,
For beauty doth never tire.
— Margaret Fuller
