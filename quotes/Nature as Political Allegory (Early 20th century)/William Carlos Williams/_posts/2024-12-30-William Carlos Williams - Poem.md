Poem
As the cat
climbed over
   the top of
    the house

    and looked
    down
    at the world,

I thought of
    the man
who is the
    father of us
all
and if a cat
    could see
    the world
so much
    would happen
if it weren't so.

    I looked up there
the sky was
    blue.


- William Carlos Williams
