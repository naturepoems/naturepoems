To the Man on Trial

In the savage emblem of the wild, 
Where the ripples dance upon the stream, 
I turn a moment to the air, inspired, 
Seeking what dreams from nature gleam. 

Here, the whispering leaves and burbling brooks 
Conspire together in joyous play, 
To teach the mind, to free the spirit, 
To feel the push of life, come what may. 

Yet man, encaged in his hapless trials, 
Forgets the earthâ€”the dawning sun, 
And sees not that each moment still reconciles, 
Nature's lessons, always won.

So hear the cry of the the fragrant woods, 
Listen to the life upon the wings, 
For in nature's arms, there lies a truth, 
The harmony of all living things.

- Jack London
