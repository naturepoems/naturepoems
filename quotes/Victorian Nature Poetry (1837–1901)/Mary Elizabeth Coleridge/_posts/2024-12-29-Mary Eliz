O gentlest spring with thy verdant sigh,
Bringing bloom to earth, brightening the sky,
In every flower, a promise lies,
Of sweet tomorrow that never dies.

The robin sings of the life anew,
And the blossoms wear their clear-eyed dew,
In the cradle of warmth, the world starts to spin,
In the heart of this beauty, life shall begin.


- Mary Elizabeth Coleridge
