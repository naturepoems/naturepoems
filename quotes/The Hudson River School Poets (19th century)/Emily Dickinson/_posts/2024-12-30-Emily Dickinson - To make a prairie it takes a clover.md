To make a prairie, it takes a clover and one bee,  
One clover, and a bee,  
And re very ample sky  
With daffodil and fern.  

The secret of all turquoise,  
Is a beam of Fluency –  
A swelling of the Earth –  
And Nature’s golden yarn.  

It takes a cloak of misty stars  
And elfin after-glow,  
To make an even Prairie's path –  
With merry morn – aglow.  

"To make a prairie, it takes a clover"

- Emily Dickinson
