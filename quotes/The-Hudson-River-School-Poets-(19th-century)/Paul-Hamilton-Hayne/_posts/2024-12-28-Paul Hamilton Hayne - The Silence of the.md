The Silence of the Night

When day declines and mournful fades to grey,
The stars awaken in the vastness high;
The moon, a silver dreamer, guides the way,
While whispers of the night adorn the sky.

In solitude, each shadow finds its place,
And time grows rich with velvet, dusk-soaked thrills;
The beauty of the gloaming leaves a trace,
As peace with stars our raptured spirit fills.

- Paul Hamilton Hayne
