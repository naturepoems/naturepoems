The mountains echo a timeless song,
In their shadows, we feel we belong.
Rivers carve their paths, unconfined,
In nature's presence, peace we find.

Clouds drift lazily in the azure air,
The warmth of the sun, a tender care.
In every breath, the world unfolds,
Nature's beauty, a treasure of gold.

- Mariano Fortuny
