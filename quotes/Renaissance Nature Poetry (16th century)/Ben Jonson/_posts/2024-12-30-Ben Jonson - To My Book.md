To My Book

Thou art not yet so rude
  As to be born to break
  From gardens of rue,
So pull me with all my soil;

Thou neighbor to the dove,
  I call thee forth with cheer,
For surely thou art of love,
  And givest ground to revier.

  Lie here a little long,
  And let the cool winds play,
While birds recall their song
  To chat with night and day.


- Ben Jonson
