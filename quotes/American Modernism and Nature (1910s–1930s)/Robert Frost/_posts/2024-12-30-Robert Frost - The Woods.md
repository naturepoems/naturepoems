The woods are full of trees,
A place for every kind,
For shade and shelter
And though the leaves do fall,
The trees will stand till spring.

Let’s have no more of this,
The grass will grow again,
And what is dead will surely rise,
The cycle shall not end.

A circle drawn mid the stars,
A mark less well defined.
So let the woods stand still
While we find our path to light.

- Robert Frost
