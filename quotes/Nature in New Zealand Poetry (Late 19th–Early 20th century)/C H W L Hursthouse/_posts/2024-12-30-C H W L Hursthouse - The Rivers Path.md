The River's Path

The river flows, a winding thread,
Through valleys deep where dreams are fed.
With every turn, a tale it weaves,
Of life and love in rustling leaves.

It carves the earth with disciplined grace,
A timeless journey, a sacred space.
And as it meets the ocean’s embrace,
It tells of travels, the endless race.

So follow the river, let it guide,
In every current, truth resides.
For in its flow, we too shall find,
The path of life, both calm and blind.
