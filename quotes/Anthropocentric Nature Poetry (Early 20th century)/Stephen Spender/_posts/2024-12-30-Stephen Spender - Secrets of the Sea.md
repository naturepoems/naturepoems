The sea’s forgotten secrets,
Lapping upon the edges of beaches,
Whispers with the tide of memories,
Show shadows of our reflected moments.

The sands tremble underfoot,
As grains shift and slide away,
While whispers of the water retreat,
With the murmurs of crabs and dreams.

Yet the horizon holds Its stance,
A painted canvas stretched wide,
Telling of promises kept,
No man's hand can blot out the stars.

- Stephen Spender
