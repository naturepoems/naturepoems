Sculptor
The Gean Tree, white ones, dark red, all bare,
   Of ivory in its ashes, is the leaves.
Green like an olive tree, and flower-like.
     I paint a piece,
        I bent the body, I drew the hair.
Roses, fair and most pleasant, both red and white
   I might pluck them, but apart from your thought
      It is the sadness of every year, 
   The whole world might have some green.

- Ezra Pound
