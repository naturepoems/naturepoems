The Whale
by Gregory Corso

A whale— 
young and pale,
that was born in the ocean
and sings like a flute,
who, on the night of his leaving,
kissed the surface of the sea,

now swims through the city,
leaving waves of shadows,
From building to building
like sweet song,
flapping its heart in the wind,
wondering where the moon
keeps its feathered crowns.

The great whale knows
only the vastness of water,
that fills his chest,
- that speaks the languages
far below the noise,
his being a palace
of treasures.

In the light of the stars
that glimmer for him,
the whale knows only
kindness,
and the night's embrace,
as he glides under bridges
unraveling this
brilliant silence.

- Gregory Corso
