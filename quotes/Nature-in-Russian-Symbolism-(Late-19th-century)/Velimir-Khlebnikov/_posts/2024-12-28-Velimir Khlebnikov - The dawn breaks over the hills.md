The dawn breaks over the hills,  
a gentle kiss of light,  
awakening the world,  
a lover's touch on sleepy eyes.  

Every blade of grass unfurls,  
each flower yawns awake, 
nature's symphony begins again,  
a song of joy, of life at stake,  
a reminder of the connection  
we all share with this breath of air.

- Velimir Khlebnikov
