The clouds low hung over the dell,
As soft and gauzy sheets unfold;
The evening sun, as a sentinel,
Rich purple tides 'gainst the hills enfold.

The brook, with laughter in its flow,
Doth weave its songs with a ceaseless cheer;
'Tis but a moment, and yet it glows,
A spark in shadows over there.

Lofty mountains rise where soft winds wail,
And nature weaves her spell so fine;
Creating beauty that will not tire,
The heart rejoicesâ€”a sacred shrine.

- James Russell Lowell
