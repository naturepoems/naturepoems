The Sea and the Skylark

As a dare in the sea, more glistening, 
    The skylark swings; wild with winging 
    Upward and momentarily at its peak 
    No less than glimmering air, fleetingly by; 
    Then does it dive, trim as a bell. 

And yet, oh soft, slender song, returning, 
    Nightly hear its shudder and pull down, 
    The sea lifts for choir and stands its ground, 
    More cacophonies galloping. 

Yet while I listen, I cannot find;  
    Amid wild waves, I find but soul-knowledge lost, 
    Treasures like waves running far away by. 

                                                        -- Gerard Manley Hopkins, 1880
