Each leaf is a story,
Curled and crisp in the wind,
With tales wrapped in their veins,
From summer's heat to autumn's chill.
They rustle as secrets spoken,
In the breath of treesâ€”
Alive, connected,
In this shared existence,
Fragile yet persistent,
Each whisper a note of life itself.

- Evelyn Scott
