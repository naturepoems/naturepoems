The flower that blooms in morning light,  
With colors pure and bright,  
Knows beauty in the sun's first ray,  
Before the fading twilight.  
Yet in each shadowed vale, you see,  
The promise of the night in bloom,  
An endless spring, a mystery;  
In every petal, life’s perfume.  


- William Holman Hunt
