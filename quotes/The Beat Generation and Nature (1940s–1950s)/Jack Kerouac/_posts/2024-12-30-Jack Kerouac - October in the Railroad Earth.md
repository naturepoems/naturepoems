October in the Railroad Earth

The leaves are falling
and there are 
trains everywhere, 
rolling through
this quiet forest, rolling
far away and into
oblivion. 

The call of 
the iron wheel echoes,
crossing bridges,
through the trees,
its sound makes me think
of the wind
and the beauty of silence.

Each moment fleeting,
bound up in the sights
and sounds of nature,
I can hear the whispers
of leaves, all around,
immersing me
in the colors of autumn.

The soft kiss of
the sun breaks through,
inviting me to wander,
to seek the home
of the wild, the sort of
life breathes free between
the tracks.
