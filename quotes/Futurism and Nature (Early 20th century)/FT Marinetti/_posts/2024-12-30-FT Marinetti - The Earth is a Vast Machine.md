The Earth is a vast machine,
Starry eternal Power,
Luminous, loud, and huge,
At the center of this universe of machines.

Expanding, vibrating,
It becomes entrapped in its own creations,
Electrifying every primal desire,  
Translating each word from a human mouth to its own.  

Beneath all of this, 
New stars are being birthed,  
The wild, electric winds,
Wrap natureâ€™s beauty in strong, iron chains.

In this chaos of growth,
The ancient trunks of our forests,  
Rusted and broken,
Still cling to their roots, 
Mighty, amid the thrill of mechanized existence.

- FT Marinetti
