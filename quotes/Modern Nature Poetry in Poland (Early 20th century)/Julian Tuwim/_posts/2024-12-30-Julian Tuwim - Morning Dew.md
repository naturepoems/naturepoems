Morning dew kisses the grass,
Awakening dreams from the night,
A sparkle of life in each droplet,
Nature's jewels catching light.

Birdsongs break the stillness,
A symphony of joy unfurls,
As flowers stretch toward daylight,
In the soft embrace of swirls.

Daylight spills its golden warmth,
Across fields of unyielding dreams,
Where the heart of nature dances,
And life flows in endless streams.

- Julian Tuwim
