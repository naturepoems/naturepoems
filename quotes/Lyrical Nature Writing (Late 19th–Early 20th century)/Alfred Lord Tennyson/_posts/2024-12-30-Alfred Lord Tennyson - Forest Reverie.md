A forest deep, by sun’s soft glance,
  Where verdant branches play,
The laughter of the brook's sweet dance,
  Doth never fade away.

‘Neath heavy boughs where shadows dwell,
  In quietude, we rest;
The world has its tale to tell,
  Though silent Nature’s best.

And as the sun sinks low and kind,
  A peace falls from above;
Taking deep, comforting sighs,
  All intertwined with love.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
