Upon the meadows, soft and green,
A gentle breeze runs, fresh and clean;
The flowers dance with each caress,
In nature's stillness, find our rest.

The sun dips low, the shadows grow,
In colors vivid, nature's glow;
Each petal tells a tale of light,
In harmony, day turns to night.

- Vladimir Solovyov
