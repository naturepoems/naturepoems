The clouds are purple
and the heat folds 
ovel valleys, directing 
the shadows of children
who flourish in skies.
The rocks are still,
with a hush of dawn, 
the rivers sing 
the songs of spring.

And here we stand,
with our hearts in our hands,
feeling the pulse of the lands,
wrapped in wonder and wild.

- Carl Sandburg
