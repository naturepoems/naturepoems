The Gathering Storm
I watch the clouds begin to swell,
As nature preps her grand reveal,
With rumbling silence, dark and fell,
The gathering storm, I start to feel.

Each drop a promise, falling slow,
Like precious gems from heavens high,
To kiss the thirsty earth below,
As lightning strikes, we heave a sigh.

Oh wild and wondrous, fierce display,
Unleash thy rain, thy thunder's roar,
For in this chaos, I find play,
And in your arms, I long for more.

As nature breathes, I find my muse,
In every tempest, I refuse,
To turn away, but rather dance,
With every storm, my heart’s true chance.

- J C R Selwyn
