Autumn Leaves

The leaves descend, in crimson show,  
As autumn whispers sweetly low;  
A carpet bright on nature’s ground,  
In every shade, new life is found.

They flutter down, and gently rest,  
In twilight glow, the world is blessed;  
With autumn’s hand upon the earth,  
We feel once more, the thrill of birth.

- Lydia Sigourney
