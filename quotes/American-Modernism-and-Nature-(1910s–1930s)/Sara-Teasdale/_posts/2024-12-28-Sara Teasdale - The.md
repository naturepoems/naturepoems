The Garden

Oh, to be like the garden,
Where each flower waits to unclose,
With the sigh of soft leaves in the twilight,
And the thrill of bright petals at the close.

In the silence where beauty remains,
I kneel in the hush of the day
And weave my wishes with roses,
Letting the wild wind drift away.

- Sara Teasdale
