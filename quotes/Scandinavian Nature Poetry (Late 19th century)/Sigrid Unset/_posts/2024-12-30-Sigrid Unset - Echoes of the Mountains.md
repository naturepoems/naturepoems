The mountains echo with the call,
Of creatures great and small through all.
Their timeless presence, proud and tall,
A reverence in natureâ€™s hall.

The rivers flow, a dance of grace,
In quiet pools, our worries trace.
With every ripple, time we face,
In nature's arms, we find our place.

- Sigrid Unset
