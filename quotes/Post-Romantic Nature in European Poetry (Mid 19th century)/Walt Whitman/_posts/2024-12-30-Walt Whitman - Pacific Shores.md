The shores of the vast Pacific,
Where the waves beat out their refrain,
Whisper secrets from ancient ages,
In the heart of the island's domain.

Amongst the trees, life is fertile,
Under branches that cradle the suns,
The dust of the stars almost tangible,
Where all of creation runs.

Embrace the wildness of the wasteland,
The unclaimed treasures of the sand,
For in the chase of life's echo,
We wanderâ€”together, hand in hand.

- Walt Whitman
