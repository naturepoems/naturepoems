A storm brews fierce, the thunder rolls,  
Nature's power, her strength consoles.  
Raindrops scatter, dance on roofs,  
As lightning weaves, the night improves.

In tempest’s fury, I find release,  
Mother Earth’s heartbeat, a wild peace.  
With each gust of wind, I stand in awe,  
For in her chaos, lies a law.

- Sigrid Undset
