Evening Shadows

As the sun sets on the plain,
And the hues of twilight rise,
In the whispers of the lane,
Nature speaks without disguise.

Shadows stretch and softly play,
In the calm of evening light,
While the stars begin to sway,
Painting secrets in the night.

Here in beauty’s soft embrace,
Time does pause, and hearts feel free,
In the twilight, nature’s grace,
Every moment speaks to me.

- Henry Lawson
