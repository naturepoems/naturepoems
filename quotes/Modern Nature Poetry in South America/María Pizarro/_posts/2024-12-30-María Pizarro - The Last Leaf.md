The Last Leaf

As autumn slips into winter,
the last leaf clings to its branch,
a tenacious spark of life,
holding onto warmth as the cold encroaches.

Each flutter a sign of defiance,
as the wind whispers its goodbye,
while the tree stands bare,
a silhouette against the fading light.

In its falling, a grace descends,
a reminder of cycles that persist,
as the earth holds its breath,
a prelude to renewal waiting beneath.


- María Pizarro
