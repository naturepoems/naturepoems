My Garden

My garden blooms in the tender light,
  Thro’ the shimmering dew on every leaf;
It whispers tenderly through the night,
  Bring gifts of love without grief.

Each flower tells a thousand tales of yore,
  Scents of passion drift between each bloom;
In every bud, there waits an open door,
  For love that wanders ‘neath the moon.

- Isabella Valancy Crawford
