Echoes of the Ocean

Waves crash against the rugged cliffs,
A symphony of tumbling sound,
The oceanâ€™s voice, strong and fierce,
Whispers secrets of the profound.

With each retreat, it paints the shore,
In foamy trails, a fleeting mark,
Reflecting all that is untamed,
The vastness held within the dark.

From this edge of earth, I gaze afar,
Into horizons where skies collide,
And in the salty breeze, I am free,
Drifting like dreams upon the tide.

- Torrenti Orazio
