The Wind

The soft wind is a whispering voice,
  A lover's breath in spring,
  That through the trees and tender leaves,
  A golden joy doth bring.

It tangles in the leafy hair
  Of blossomed cherry trees,
  And flutters on the flower's stare,
  In fragrant hap and ease.

Oh, let the soft wind hold my dreams
  As secrets of the air,
  And I will weave its melody
  To thoughts of lilac fair!

- William Wilfred Campbell
