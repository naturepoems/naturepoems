The golden sheaves of wheat sway high in the fields,
A bounty of summer, rich harvest yields.
The corn is a sentinel, standing so tall,
Witness to moments both mundane and enthrall.

The twilight swathes the world in a dusky embrace,
And stars punctuate sky in their luminous grace.
Each whisper of wind through high branches stirs,
Natureâ€™s soft cadence, her symphonious lures.


- Willa Cather
