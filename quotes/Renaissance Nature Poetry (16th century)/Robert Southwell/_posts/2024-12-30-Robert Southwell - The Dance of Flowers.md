Oh, how the flowers dance and play,
In sunshine’s arms, they find their way;
The grass, a carpet, lush and bright,
Where dreams awaken in the light.
The buzzing bees and singing lark,
In harmony, they leave their mark;
Through nature’s song, we find our grace,
In every corner, magic’s trace.

- Robert Southwell
