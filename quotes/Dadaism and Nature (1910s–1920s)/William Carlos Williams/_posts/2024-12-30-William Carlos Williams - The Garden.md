The Garden

This little flower is you
It has dappled leaves and hangs
upon the silken thread of fate,
it is perfect, perfect, tiny, small,
dance of matter caught in blossom's pose.

Like an echo in itself you sway
and reach together in the chorus of beauty--
together in a small curl and rise
and halt in the stillness of heaven's breath.

- William Carlos Williams
