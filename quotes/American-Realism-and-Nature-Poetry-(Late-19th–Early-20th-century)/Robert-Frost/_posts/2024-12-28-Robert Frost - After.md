After Apple-Picking
My long two-pointed ladder’s sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still, and there’s a barrel that I didn’t fill
Beside it, and there may be two or three
Apples I didn’t pick upon some bough.
But I am done with apple-picking now.
Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.
I cannot shake the smell of apples. 
My harvesting is over, and I have no harvest.

I have seen the world’s end and the tree-shadows,
And I stare until I could hear it breathe.
I am done with apple-picking now.
The whole tree is a sleeping apple,
That was my harvest, staring at me, awaiting sleep.
There will be no more bounty in my overlooking.

- Robert Frost
