The Lay of the Love of the Earth

Again, I found my bearings in the world.
And I felt the air around me,
Like a broad stream, and I breathed.
The paths led never closing around,
Cool meadows, and in the distance, trees,
Their silhouettes rising, looking distant yet so close,
The sun pierced through branches; then,
The scene just vibrated and danced,
An urge for freedom settled over darkened space,

And in this silent dream, 
Where love insisted on existing, 
I could see creatures, delight in them, 
The call of nature echoed within me. 

Now listen again—softly, softly—
To the wind that croons sweetly, 
Let it wrap you close within.
You are never separate from the things you love, 
But always supported by the earth's breath, 
A cradle of nature, suspended so gentle.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
