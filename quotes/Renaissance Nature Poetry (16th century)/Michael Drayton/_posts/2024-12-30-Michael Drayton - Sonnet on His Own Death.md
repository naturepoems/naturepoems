Sonnet on His Own Death
Death shall not have mercy on my dreams,
Nor turn my heart from gentle joys away;
For as is river’s flow, and sun beam’s gleam,
My soul shall float alive, undimmed today.

With every breath, I feel the world's embrace;
The air is sweet and gentle on my skin;
The bird-song lifts my spirit to a place
Where earth and sky unite, and love will win.

O death, you’re but a door to grander sights,
The garden bright with flowers of purest hue,
Where peace shall reign in such soft, golden lights,
Finding my essence in the world, anew.

So till my end remain both bright and fair,
As nature's breath whispers through all the air.


- Michael Drayton
