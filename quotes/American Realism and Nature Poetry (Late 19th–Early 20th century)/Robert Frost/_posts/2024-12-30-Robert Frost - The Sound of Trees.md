I believed that the world was made for grown-ups.  
And through the woods I crept with taken pain,  
For fear I would see him in my snare,  
The other figure, the crown—bound  
In every world I had not made or said.  

And yet each night they found me there and thin  
As in their ears they meant to say  
We are you and we are made for him as well,  
A type of thing most might have taken in themselves  
Through the woodlands to the wide-leafed side.  

So the woods through spring will lead me clear,  
And I will come not to rust underfoot,  
For fear I would, as far as any thought  
That can clear the bravest finds alive.  

The wildflower heads will lean like hands from earth  
To take me in for the what and what was mine.

- Robert Frost
