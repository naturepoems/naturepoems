The Snowdrop

Spring’s first whispers drift among the earth,
Tender and soft; a broken day, it’s cluttered
With layers of frost. Who can remember
The taste of warmth in that darkness? And now,
While veins pulse, light can be found spilling,
Each stem a claim locked fresh within the thaw;
As body, pulse from remnants of heavy night.

The snowdrop breaks through angling rays,
Each bloom chimes softly, a fragile memory,
Whispering the truth of a new embrace;
Yet it is feeling spun tight inside, a safety
Cradled in layers released to the sun,
Each petal a glimpse of winter's hold undone,
And in breath, we rise, untangling from fate.

With every hearty push below,
The frost-laden roots embrace as shoots,
Greening; deeper still they smile,
Speaking softly into recollections sung,
While time plays on between the breaths of life,
The snowdrop flares into warm gilded sight—
So soft it fades away with the mindful light.

- Sylvia Plath
