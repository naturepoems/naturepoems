There is a garden in her face,
Where roses and white lilies grow;
A heavenly paradise is that place,
Wherein all secret pleasures go.

A viewing cherry, in the bloom,
And the heavenly apple, placed there; 
The fruit of love, as now, in gloom,
And if one were do better care.

Before the dawn with lighted glow,
The thought does signify a move;
And think all day we feel and show,
But see the night we wish does prove.

- William Wordsworth
