The rest"

author: Ezra Pound
quote: "What thou lovest well remains,
The rest is dross;
What thou lovest well shall not
Be reft from thee.
What thou lovest well is a part
Of thy soul, thy being, the song,
A world of thy own making."

What thou lovest well remains,
The rest is dross;
What thou lovest well shall not
Be reft from thee.
What thou lovest well is a part
Of thy soul, thy being, the song,
A world of thy own making.

- Ezra Pound
