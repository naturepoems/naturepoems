Nature’s Palette

Brush strokes of green in a world filled with grace,
Nature’s own canvas spreads wide in this place.
With rivers as ribbons that carve through the land,
And mountains like guardians that silently stand.

The echoes of colors, the scents rich and bold,
Tell stories of seasons, of life to behold.
In every creation, a beauty not planned,
Nature doth whisper the touch of her hand.


- R A Reginald Campbell
