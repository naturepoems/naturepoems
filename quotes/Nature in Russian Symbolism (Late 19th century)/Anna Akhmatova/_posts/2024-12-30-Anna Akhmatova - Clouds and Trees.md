The clouds drift by, like thoughts in my mind,
A slow, unfurling tapestry of grey,
The trees stand solemn, watching in silence,
While shadows lengthen, extending their sway.

With autumn whispers upon the breeze,
The leaves let go their brittle, gilded gold,
Falling softly to the earth's embrace,
A dance of decay, a story retold.


- Anna Akhmatova
