There’s a certain Slant of light,  
Winter Afternoons -  
That oppresses, like the Heft  
Of Cathedral Tunes -  

Heavenly Hurt, it gives us -  
We can find no scar,  
But internal difference,  
Where the Meanings, are -  

None may teach it - Any -  
'Tis the seal of nature -  
An imperial Affliction  
Sent us of the Free -  

When it comes, the landscape  
Sits on invisible  
As an Oak does, in the Forest,  
Among the timids - all!

- Emily Dickinson
