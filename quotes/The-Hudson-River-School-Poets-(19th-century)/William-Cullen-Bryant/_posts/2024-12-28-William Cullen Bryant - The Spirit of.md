The Spirit of Water

The spirit of water flows onward, unseen;  
In veins of emerald stars shall it pass,  
Classical echoes, imbued in the green, 
Descend in the evening, the moon's hollow glass.

Beneath the great hills lies a fountain of day,  
Where shadows all weave in the moments between;  
And there may the dreams of our youth always stay,  
In whispers of shadows that ever stay green.

- William Cullen Bryant
