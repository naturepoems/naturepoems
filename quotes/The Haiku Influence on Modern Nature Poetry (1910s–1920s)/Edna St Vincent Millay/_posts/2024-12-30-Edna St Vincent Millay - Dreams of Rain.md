Dreams drip like rain from the leaves of the trees,
In the hush of the evening, where shadows unfold.
Let me gather the moments, like soft summer breeze,
And know in my heart that the earth cradles bold.
Harmony of colors flows gently like streams,
In each breath I find music in memories told.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
