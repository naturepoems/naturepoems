The Dalliance of the Eagles

Skimming the surface of the sea, the eagles fly,
Dancing in the air, and circling low,
Indulging in the flicker of shadows as they pass,
They seem as one with the breeze, letting it guide.

In their sharp descent, they show their grace,
And the mind of the wild sings within their wings,
They know no bounds, just the vast blue sky,
A dalliance that speaks of longevity.


- Walt Whitman
