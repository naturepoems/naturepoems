Ode to Duty  
Stern Daughter of the Voice of God!  
I heed thee, I am fraught with awe;  
I feel how awful is the sacred law  
That bindeth all my soul to thee alone.  

For from the wildness of the woods  
To the churning shores of sea,  
I seek the boundless harmony  
That soothes the restless heart in me.  

Yet O this Life of Freedom, too!  
That calls my spirit to the sky,  
Bright visions of the blooming wild,  
In truth, how can I say goodbye?  

O Nature, O Delight profound,  
In every blossom, grace is found!  

Stern Duties call, yet soft I stand,  
To dream with thee, to take thy hand.

- William Wordsworth
