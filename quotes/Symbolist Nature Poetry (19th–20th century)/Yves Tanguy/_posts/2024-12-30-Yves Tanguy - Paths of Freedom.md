In the open expanse where freedom reigns,  
The mountains echo with the call of fate,  
In nature’s arms, where stillness remains,  
The heart embraces what time dictates.

Each trail we wander, each path we seek,  
In whispered moments, the spirit flies,  
In nature's rhythm, strong yet meek,  
Life unfolds beneath boundless skies.


- Yves Tanguy
