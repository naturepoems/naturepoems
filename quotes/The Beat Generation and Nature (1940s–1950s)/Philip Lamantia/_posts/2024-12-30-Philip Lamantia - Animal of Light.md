O the bear and deer,
the eagle and owl,
you who furnish the voice
of the lost god!
                                              
Let the hedges remember,
   let the earth remember,
you who watch at the spring,
you who sing to yourself
in the midst of the parentless night!

I am the fox who missed your paths,
the ancient image,
the animal of light traveling
through the buried memory of man.

- Philip Lamantia
