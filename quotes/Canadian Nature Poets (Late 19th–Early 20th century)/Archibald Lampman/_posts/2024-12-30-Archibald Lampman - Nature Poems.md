The Day is Done

The day is done, and the sweet night falls,
As stars grow bright in a silent sky;
And the hills are darkened, and the valley calls
In whispers soft to the wandering sigh.
Oh! calm and peace, in this quiet hour,
Where the forest stands with its fragrant flowers
When the evening winds, like a whispering shower
Go rustling through the trees and bowers.

In the evening hush, the brook’s smooth flow
Sounds sweet as a secret that comes from the heart;
And dreams of the past in a soft glow,
Cross the darkened land, like shadows they part.

Rest then, dear heart, in this tranquil time,
When the world sleeps on, as in dreams we climb.

A Christmas Hymn

The whole world feels a little light;
A breath of joy from one great heart;
Before us stands the giant night
With all his stars, as we depart.

For sheer the beauty of the earth
Is a boon of love from above,
And Peace has found a friendly hearth
To tell us of the gift of Love.

And like an angel's voice we hear
The echo of the glory sung;
Oh! Christmas morn, so bright and clear,
A breath of joy from all so young.


=======

The Sycamore

There stood a tall sycamore,
Its branches wide did spread unnerved,
With bark so rough to get to
Its strength long withstood, preserved.

It nurtures life in its embrace;
The leaves, like gossip, ever sway,
A blessèd shade; a lingering grace,
In summer’s warm and golden day.

Underneath its leafy crown,
The burdened heart could find its rest;
As breezes whisper soft their sound,
A resting point the heart knows best.


=======

The River

Gentle stream that slowly weaves,
Through valley fair and hillock’s crest;
I murmur softly, while it grieves
With wandering pains that know no rest.

You sing me low to sleep at night,
While star-dust settles ever shy;
Your liquid silver flecks the light,
As if the moon could only cry.

Dear river, do you bear my dreams
To distant lands where beauty grows?
Where every whisper softly gleams,
And every ripple gently flows.


=======

A Sunset Moment

The sun has sunk; the purple stands
In shadows soft upon the hills,
And twilight rolls in golden strands
Behind the clouds, like hidden thrills.

The lingering light begins to fade;
A chill stirs softly through the trees,
Gray shadows flicker, softly laid
Upon the earth, with whispers, “Peace.”

Oh, let me stay here for a while,
Upon this quiet breast of earth,
To breathe the coolness, sense each smile,
And hear the night unfold its mirth.


=======

The Lake

The lake is deep, with mirrored grace,
Each rippling wave a whispered tune;
The twilight draws a soft embrace,
A spell that binds the heart, and soon.

The sails are white upon the sea,
Resting on water’s silver sheen;
In evening’s glow, the world can be
A boundless peace, a tranquil dream.

In solitude, my heart does float,
Upon the lake; it knows no hue;
And yet, like music, it does softly coat,
The breath of life, beneath the blue.


=======

The Woods

O woods, that from the hillside rise
With gentle arms enfolding wide,
Your branches kiss the azure skies,
In silence whispering the tide.

With every breeze, a soft embrace,
Your boughs are filled with life’s sweet song;
And I, in these serene spaces,
Can feel my spirit glide along.

The whispers of the dying day,
Bring forth the fragrance of the past,
Where every leaf shall softly play,
In love that ever blooms and lasts.


=======

To the Moon

O gentle moon that glimmers bright,
You throw your silver upon the lake;
In calm and quiet beams of light,
You touch my heart, as dreams awake.

Your whispers sing of peace and hope;
They fill the skies; in endless night,
And while I wander, I shall cope
With shadows danced by your soft sight.

So take me now; my heart can soar,
For beauty flows where you have been,
And with your light, I long for more,
In solitude, where I’ve been keen.


=======

Autumn

The air is crisp, the trees grow bare;
The golden leaves are gently spread;
In autumn's breath, I feel the care
Of time that dies, the day that fled.

Yet in this spell, it’s beauty sings,
Of fading lights and soft goodbyes;
A softer silence gently clings,
To every branch, as sorrow sighs.

Yet do not mourn the fallen day,
For beauty lingers in each dawn;
And as the winds toss leaves away,
The light persists, though life seems gone.


=======

Glenwood

To walk beneath the tall pine trees,
And catch the fragrance of their breath,
To feel the whispering of the breeze,
That echoes softly through sweet depth.

Oh! nature sings a tranquil song,
In glades where golden flowers bloom,
And hearts that once were filled with wrong
Receive their peace within this room.

In autumn’s chime and summer’s grace,
Life breathes anew within my soul;
For Beauty walks in timeless space,
And all the dark can feel its toll.


=======

The Snow

The snow fell soft, like cotton's white,
An angel's touch upon the ground;
In morning light, so pure, so bright,
The world finds beauty all around.

Each crystal flake, as silence bears,
A gentle art that time has rolled,
A secret kept, as nature shares,
Her wondrous gifts for hearts so bold.

And in the night, it softly glows,
The world rests easy, cushioned fair;
Yet beauty’s promise still bestows,
A touch of love upon the air.


=======

The Dawn

O glorious dawn, so fair and bright,
With gilded shafts that pierce the morn;
You chase the shadows, claim the light,
And bring the peace of the reborn.

The whispers of the waking stars,
Transcend the dark, unfurling grace;
As day begins to heal the scars,
That night once left, a hidden trace.

So let me dwell within your song,
As beauty flows from every part;
In every light where I belong,
I feel the touch upon my heart.


=======

Spring

The buds unfold, the saplings grow,
In life’s embrace, the joy returns;
And every leaf that drips with snow,
A golden blush, as hope still yearns.

Each petal sways, a dance of glee,
In silver rain and fragrant kiss;
For every bloom that shares the plea,
Is but a step towards purest bliss.

And in the warmth of nature’s hold,
I feel the pulse of my true friend;
For every flower, as they unfold,
Announce the love that has no end.
