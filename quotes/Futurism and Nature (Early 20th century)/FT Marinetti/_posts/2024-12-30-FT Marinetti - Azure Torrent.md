An azure torrent dashes,
Spilling over rocks in jubilant cries,
As nature weaves strong filaments,
Leading us toward raging rivers.

In breathless moments of sunlight,
The wild flares like thunder,
Echoing the roar of creation,
Through valleys undulating in dreams!  

Sunset becomes a loud rustle,
Filling the world with murmuring light,
As machines hum along the shores,
Letting waves crash on the future!

- FT Marinetti
