There is no gift to compare with the gift of nature's beauty,
In the bloom of the cherry trees,
In the swirl of the daffodils,
And in the light through the leaves.

Each morning the glory
Of the world breaks anew, untainted,
With the sound of the wind,
With the songs of the birds.

When I wake at dawn
And lift my eyes to the sky,
I see the color of love,
And I breathe in the world.

- Sara Teasdale
