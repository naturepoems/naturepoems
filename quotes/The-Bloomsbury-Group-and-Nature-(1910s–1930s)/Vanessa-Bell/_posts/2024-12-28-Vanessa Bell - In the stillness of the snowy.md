In the stillness of the snowy night,
Each flake a jewel in moonlit glow,
The world transformed, pure and white,
In winter’s hush, I learn to know.

That nature speaks in every form,
In silence, warmth, and frosty grace,
Each season, part of life’s grand norm,
Revealed in time, our sacred place.

- Vanessa Bell
