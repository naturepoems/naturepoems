The last of the day is weathered,
A graying sky draping over my heart,
Where the green earth hugs the damp,
And the clouds cradle the birds.

I walk among the waving grass,
Each blade is a kiss from the sun,
Urging me to holler out my lost praise,
To thank the evening blooming small flowers—a stir,
Maybe a little whisper of a rise from sleep.

- Gwendolyn Brooks
