Spring Song
The sun is a golden ball
That rolls across the sky
With the blue of heaven,
And the whispering winds of May.

Spring is like a breath of air
That fills our lungs again,
It is the music of the flowers
That dance upon the ground.

O Spring! O gentle Spring!
Come, let us love the day,
With your colors bright and beautiful,
And your skies so full of play.

- Langston Hughes
