The Fading Leaf

When in the autumn's soft embrace,
The trees in gold and crimson dress,
There dwells a charm, a soothing grace,
That hushes all our wild distress.

Each falling leaf a whisper brings,
The song of life to sweetly hear,
It weaves through every sad thing,
And stirs our hearts with love and cheer.

Though many things, we see, must die,
And fade away with every season,
Yet in their loss, we learn to fly,
For every end births greater reason.
