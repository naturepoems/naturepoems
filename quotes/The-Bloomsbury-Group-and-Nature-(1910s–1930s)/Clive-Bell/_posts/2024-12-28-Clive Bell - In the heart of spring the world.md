In the heart of spring, the world awakes,
With gentle breezes, the earth remakes.
The garden blooms, a feast for the eyes,
In nature’s palette, love never dies.

The chirping crickets serenade the night,
As fireflies dance with pure delight.
In these moments, we find our way,
In nature’s arms, forever to stay.

- Clive Bell
