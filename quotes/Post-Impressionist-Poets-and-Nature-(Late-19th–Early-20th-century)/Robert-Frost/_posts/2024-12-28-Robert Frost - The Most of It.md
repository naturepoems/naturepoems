The Most of It  
I took a road with many a twist  
Through a wood where pine-needles lay,  
Underfoot, like a conjurer’s dust,  
Abreast the dark where the passers sway.  
  
Beyond the trees I caught the sound  
Of a clear and open rushing stream  
And drew my breath in sickness, almost  
Thinking it might have been a dream.  
  
I wished for company with a dream  
To ease the woes of an endless day  
But found no one but nature’s enveloping arm  
To show me the glimmering light of play.

- Robert Frost
