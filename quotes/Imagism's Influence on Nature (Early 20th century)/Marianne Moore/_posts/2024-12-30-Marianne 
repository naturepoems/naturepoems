A Grave

Is it a grave? Within the trees,
beauty bows out; above,
all colors, not by might,
are by chance, leap forward
into an impossible blue.
A tree so hollowed out,
its arms entangle the air
towards absurd heavens,
like crooked fingers grasping
the perfect sky,
olives the grave stone—
that unsung, silent hymn,
yet fiercely rooted in time,
plunging into dreams,
opulence of earth’s melodies,
glistening leaves weighing me down,
a welcoming gentleness in grass,
whole notes of mud,
green and glistening.
