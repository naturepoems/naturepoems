Sunday Morning

Death is the mother of beauty; hence from beauty.
  This is how we spend our seasons.
This is why we abandon the notion
  That in our experiments we enhance
Life's inevitability, to some measure.
Those that were wise, those that were successful,
  They spent their summers waiting to learn
The joy of corruption when it befell
  The chill of autumn's songs. 
It's always been assumed that we must realize
  Our totality, respond to all things in beauty,
Life that breathes within the few small things
  And then upon their admit of margin.
Beyond the beauty of our fruits
  There comes a kindness,
Our reward from the labor, joy
  Of summer yield, sweet bounty which gives
To body and to soul, to be and to dwell
  In that beauty made cumulative and bright.


- Wallace Stevens
