Cypress Shadows

Amidst the cypress, shadows deep,  
Where sunlight dances, secrets sleep.  
In every knot, a tale we find,  
Of nature's heart, forever entwined.
  
The swamp's embrace, a haunting grace,  
Reflections held in nature's face.  
A world alive, both rich and rare,  
Cypress shadows, a whispered prayer.


- Halfred Lee
