To the Lighthouse

The light beyond the sea 
Whispers its secrets to me, 
Time will not assuage the longing, 
But bear it deeply with me, 
Across the foam that flies fierce, 
Over the white, lingering spray, 
Where all my echoless song, 
Hides eternal in the bay.

And thou, O wind, who ragest now, 
With salon hope, a lover’s vow, 
Take my breath in which I weave, 
A sanctuary tender, 
Where I can return, believe, 
And rest beside thy lonesome shore; 
Amidst the tranquil waltz of waves,
Who raise their voices evermore.

And nature sings, she sings to me, 
With laughter bright and bond of glee; 
Embraced by nurturing skies and sea, 
I find my solace silently.

- James Elroy Flecker
