The Cherry Trees

The cherry trees

are dressed in

white today

like little boys

would if up and downs

were a feature of their lives.

It seems the winter

is ready to die

at last and begin

to laugh again,

confessing a great deal

when the petals

fall to the ground

and let the sun vibrate

with warmth

a life-force

to stir the heart.

Yet who knows,

anything may come

out of clouds,

but the sun damn it!

Did I tell you

of the great beauty

seen this year?

- William Carlos Williams
