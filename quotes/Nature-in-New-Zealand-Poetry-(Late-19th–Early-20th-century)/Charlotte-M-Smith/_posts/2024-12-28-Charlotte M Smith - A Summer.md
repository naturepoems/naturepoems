A Summer Evening
The air is hush'd, and calm the sky,  
The sun is sinkinga-down,  
The evening dews their silver lie  
Against the lilies' crown;  
'Tis now the hour of quiet dreams,  
And every silent heart seems,  
To listen for a tender call  
Of evening’s softest thrall.

Come, joyful spirit fainting  
Upon the breath of whispered winds,  
For daylight's subtle painting  
In colors soft descends—  
Each moment glowing gold and blue,  
Light’s kisses in the fading hue,  
While night—mysterious and still,  
Wears softness to its will.

- Charlotte M Smith
