In the Heart of the Savannah
In the wild embrace of the savannah vast,
Where the sun sets low and shadows are cast.
Grasslands whisper with stories untold,
Of lion's pride and the brave and the bold.

Elephants march with a grace so grand,
And gazelles dance on the golden sand.
Nature's pulse beats, a rhythm so true,
In the heart of the savannah, life breaks through.

- Kwame Nkrumah
