Beneath the shade of the ancient oak,
a symphony of life unfolds in stillness.

The ground is alive, teeming with secrets,
while above, leaves dance in the gentle wind.

Nature's cradle rocks softly,
whispering stories of the ages long gone.

Each moment a precious jewel,
each heartbeat an echo of the world’s song.

- Kate Bush
