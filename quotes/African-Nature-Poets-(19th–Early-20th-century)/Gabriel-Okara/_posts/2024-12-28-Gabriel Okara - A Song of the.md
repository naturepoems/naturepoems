A Song of the Seasons
When the sun rises glowing,
And the dew-kissed grass awakes,
In the springtime's gentle chasing,
Life stirs in the woods and lakes.
The blossoms burst forth in laughter,
Painting landscapes wide and far,
While the breeze hums a tender tune,
Mirroring the morning star.

But when summer brings its warmth,
And the greens turn shades of gold,
Fields sway in the soft winds' hymns,
As nature’s secrets are revealed, bold.

Then autumn's brush paints red and brown,
While the leaves whisper goodbyes,
Amongst the fading echoes, I find,
The transient beauty of life implies.

And winter wraps the world in silence,
With a blanket of white so pure,
Yet beneath, the seeds are dreaming,
Of spring’s return, of life’s allure.

- Gabriel Okara
