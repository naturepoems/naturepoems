The Mountain

Above the world, the mountain stands,  
In silence grand, serene;  
With snowy peaks, and rugged hands,  
Her beauty stretches, ever seen.

I stand beneath her might and stare,  
As clouds drift by her face;  
In awe of nature’s gentle care,  
In warmth of her vast embrace.

Oh, mountain vast, thy spirits rise!  
Through every season’s turn,  
Testament to the endless skies,  
In my soul thy majesty burn.

- Lydia Sigourney
