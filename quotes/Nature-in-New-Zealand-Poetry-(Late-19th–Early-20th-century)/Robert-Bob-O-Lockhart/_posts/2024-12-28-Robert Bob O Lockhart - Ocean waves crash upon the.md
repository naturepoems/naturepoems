Ocean waves crash upon the shore,
A rhythmic dance, a ceaseless roar,
Each grain of sand, each shell that's strewn,
Tells of the tides and the light of the moon.

The call of gulls, the scent of brine,
In each breath, the sea’s design,
Nature whispers, softly sings,
Within her arms, our spirit clings.

- Robert Bob O Lockhart
