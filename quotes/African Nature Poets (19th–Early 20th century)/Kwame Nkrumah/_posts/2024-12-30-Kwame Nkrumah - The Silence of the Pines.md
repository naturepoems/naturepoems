The Silence of the Pines
In a forest of pines, where secrets reside,
The silence speaks volumes, with nature as guide.
Each needle a whisper, each trunk a tale,
Of resilience and beauty, in sun and in hail.

As I wander through shadows, in peace I am found,
In the hush of the forest, where love does abound.
The pines stand as sentinels, wise and serene,
Guarding the stories of all that have been.

- Kwame Nkrumah
