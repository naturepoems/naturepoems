The Stream  
  
  
The stream, it laughs as down it flows,  
A joyful waltz on stones so gleam,  
With every leap, it dances free,  
A silver ribbon in daydream.  
  
It winds through moss and fallen leaves,  
A tender touch, a soft caress,  
In nature’s lap, it seeks its way,  
A song of love, a sweet finesse.  
  
Each bend, a canvas full of grace,  
Each splash, a note of life’s refrain,  
O stream of dreams, forever bright,  
Your fleeting words, a sweet domain.

- EJ Pratt
