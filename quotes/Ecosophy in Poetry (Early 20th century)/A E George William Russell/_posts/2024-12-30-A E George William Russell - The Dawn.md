The Dawn

At the birth of the morn  
When the shadows pass by,  
And the heart of the world  
Sings in the sunlit sky,  
I see the rose unfold,  
In the lightâ€™s warm embrace,  
And the beauty of creation  
Brightens my weary face.

O tender-hearted morning,  
With your hues of gold and blue,  
My soul stirs in the dawning  
And finds its rest in you.

- A E George William Russell
