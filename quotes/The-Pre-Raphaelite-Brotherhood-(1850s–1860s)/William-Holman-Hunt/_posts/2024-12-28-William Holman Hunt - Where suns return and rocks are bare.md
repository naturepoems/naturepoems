Where suns return, and rocks are bare,  
Upon a bank of pebbly strand,  
Your softest whispers fill the air,  
And hold the secrets of the sand.  
I wander still, by edge of coast,  
To glimpse the wild, where heath is tossed;  
Let nature flood my heart with dreams,  
All tides engage the light, not lost.  


- William Holman Hunt
