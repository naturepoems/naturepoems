The Fisherman
Although I am no fisherman,
My dreams like shadows stalk the stream,
And when the mountains cradle me,
I know they are more than they seem.

Yet still I drift like smoke,
From eddy to eddy on my way,
And this is all my fortune's will,
That's cast by dreams I can not stay.

- William Butler Yeats
