The Woodchuck
When I came home
I found an old woodchuck

at the foot of the porch

as he was taking
his time chewing soft

bark from an apple tree

and I wondered

if he would eat the pears.

Such great food

bent in the air,
it hangs for him

on the branches.

What more could he want?


- William Carlos Williams
