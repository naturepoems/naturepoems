First Party at Ken Kesey's House

The trees are so full of life tonight,
        the fire crackles warm,
            leaves glimmer in the dark,
I hear the laughter of friends,
   music of the cosmos sounds,
The sheets of stars unroll,
    a bright night, wild night,
How we feel young,
    buoyant, alive;

We put our cups up,
    raise them high and cry,
        the greatness of joy!
