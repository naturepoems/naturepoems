Through the thicket and the glade,  
In every shadow, life is laid,  
The flicker of wings, a fleeting glance,  
Nature calls us to join the dance.

From the roots that clutch the earth so tight,  
To the blooms that burst in vibrant light,  
Each moment fleeting, yet it remains,  
In every heart, the wild sustains.
