quote: "The sea breaks gently against the shore, 
a shiftless murmuration of life's touch; 
the shells gather round as if to hear, 
the tidal heart, a quiet call of labor. 
Waves are echo chambers of a lonely search, 
what we long to be we truly are."

The sea breaks gently against the shore, 
a shiftless murmuration of life's touch; 
the shells gather round as if to hear, 
the tidal heart, a quiet call of labor. 
Waves are echo chambers of a lonely search, 
what we long to be we truly are.

- Marianne Moore
