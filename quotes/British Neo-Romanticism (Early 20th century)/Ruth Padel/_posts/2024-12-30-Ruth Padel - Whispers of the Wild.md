Whispers of the Wild
In the hush of the forest,  
everything speaks —  
the rustle of leaves,  
the soft footfalls of fox,  
whispers of the wild,  
ancient and wise.

I kneel on the moss,  
turning earth between my fingers  
and hear the heartbeat of the land,  
echoes of a timeless spirit,  
a communion beneath the boughs.

Here, amongst mushrooms and ferns,  
I am reminded of this cycle —  
fading, breathing, becoming,  
all shaped by the landscapes kiss.

- Ruth Padel
