The river flows with a gentle grace,
Carving paths through the solid stone.
Yet in its depths lies a secret place,
A world where the wild things roam alone.

With ripples that sing a soothing rhyme,
It glimmers like jewels in the sun.
In every wave, a dance with time,
Nature's song can never be done.

- Anna Brigadere
