The grass is full of the dew of the dawn,
The sun awakes and kisses the forest’s brow.
In the hush of a whisper, the day’s memories yawn,
Every petal’s a treasure, no less than a vow.

The glistening morning will linger the breeze,
With laughter, it chimes, and the trees sway along,
Enchanting the silence, like music from these
Who listen, in summer, to nature’s sweet song.

The river reflects the ethereal hues,
Where lilacs bloom and river-stones gleam,
Among voices of nature, the wild, the good news,
Intricate dreams rise and softly they beam.

So hold on to time, let it flow as it might,
For beauty brews softly in morning's embrace,
Where each moment is woven in pure delight,
As life breathes beneath the sun’s holy grace.

- John Keats
