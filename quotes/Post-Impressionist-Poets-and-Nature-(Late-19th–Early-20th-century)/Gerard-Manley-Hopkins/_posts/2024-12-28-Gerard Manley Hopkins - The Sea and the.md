The Sea and the Skylark

As a dare to the norm, when even the plain
  Is turned to spaces far-fought; and awash
    In temptations of drift, where the lark flies flat,
  From the depths of the sea, released, too like life,
    Will breaking forth spill a danced path.

  Ashore in the view oft shined only, where alone,
  The marvelous can be laid across the bravest line.
    Life into melody, throwing scales of beauty,
  Seeking statistic and bright compositions
    In the hear of the land it sought to belong to –.



- Gerard Manley Hopkins
