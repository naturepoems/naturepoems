The Harvest Moon

Golden orb in the sky,
As you rise with a glow,
You light up the fields,
Where the thick crops grow.

With bountiful blessings,
The earth yields its fruit,
In the night’s quiet splendor,
Life echoes its root.

Oh moon, brilliant moon,
In your luminous flight,
You guide us in awe,
Through the dark of the night.

- John Thompson
