The rivers flow, the valleys breathe,
Nature’s hand weaves tapestries,
In every turn, in every glance,
We find our spirit’s true romance.

So walk with me through woodlands deep,
And in their fold, our secrets keep,
For here, in nature’s sweet embrace,
We find together our resting place.

- Walt Whitman
