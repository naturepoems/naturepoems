The sea churns,
   a circus of colors,
  where the waves flutter,
   like fabric unfurling,
        the horizon’s specter.

   Stars mirrored below,
by the tides of thought,
     a canvas reborn—
        creation’s pulse,
   ever-shifting.

     Each grain of sand,
     a universe anew.

- Max Ernst
