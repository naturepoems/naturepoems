The morning sun creeps slow and bright,
And paints the clouds with rosy light.
The flowers wake and spread their cheer—
Ah, Nature is the love we hold dear.

The melody of chirping birds,
Among the blooms, their happy words;
Each petal curls in soft embrace—  
My heart finds peace in Nature's grace.


- Edna St Vincent Millay
