Gentle Rain

The gentle rain falls soft and low,
A balm to every thirsty sprout,
Like whispered songs of long ago,
It hums through leaves, the air about.

Each drop a note, a lullaby,
That caresses earth with tender grace,
As clouds embrace the rolling sky,
The world finds a pacifying space.

In every flower that lifts its head,
A thirst quenched by the charming fall,
And every brook, where nature said,
The song of rain is the heart's call.


- Mary Webb
