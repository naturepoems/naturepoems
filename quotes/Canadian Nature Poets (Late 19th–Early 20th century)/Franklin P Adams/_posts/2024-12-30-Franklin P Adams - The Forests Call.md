The Forest's Call

Come wander with me, friends of heart,
Into the woodlands, where paths depart,
And listen well to the ancient trees,
That whisper softly in the breeze.

The mossy ground, the dappled light,
Invites our souls to take true flight,
In Nature’s realm, we shed our care,
And find our spirits lifted there.


- Franklin P Adams
