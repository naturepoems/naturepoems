The Last Leaf
 
When autumn winds begin to sigh,  
And golden leaves take flight and fall,  
One last leaf clings to the high,  
Defying time, it stands so tall.  

In vibrant hues of red and gold,  
It hangs on tight, a brave ado,  
A story of the seasons told,  
In nature’s dance, forever new.

- Edward Burne-Jones
