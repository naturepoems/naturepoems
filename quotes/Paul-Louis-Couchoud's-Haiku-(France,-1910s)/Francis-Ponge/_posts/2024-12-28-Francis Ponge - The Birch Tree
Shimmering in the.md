Shimmering in the brightening dawn,
Its bark peels like laughter, freeing a voice,
The dance of the leaves, a symphony of light,
Whispering to the breezes, secrets of the woods."

The Birch Tree
Shimmering in the brightening dawn,
Its bark peels like laughter, freeing a voice,
The dance of the leaves, a symphony of light,
Whispering to the breezes, secrets of the woods.

- Francis Ponge
