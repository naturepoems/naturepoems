The Sea’s Song

Tides rise and fall like thoughts,
a rhythm grounding me to this place,
a ballet of water and shore,
a symphony scored by the moon.

Each wave is a story unfolding,
salted tales of longing and return,
as shells gather whispers of ancient mariners,
echoes of lives etched in sand.

I stand at the brink, breathless,
where sky and water collide,
as the horizon melts to infinity,
a promise that calls me home.


- María Pizarro
