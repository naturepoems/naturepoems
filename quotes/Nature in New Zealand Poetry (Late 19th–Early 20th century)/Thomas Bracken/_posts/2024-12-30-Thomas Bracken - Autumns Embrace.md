AUTUMN’S EMBRACE

When summer sighs and autumn takes hold,
The trees wear dresses of amber and gold;
The crispness of air speaks of winter’s near,
As nature prepares for her rest, without fear.

The leaves, they flutter, a dance on the breeze,
In swirling patterns that catch with ease;
They whisper goodbye to the sun’s warm rays,
In a farewell song that resounds through the days.

In the harvest’s bounty, the fields stand proud,
With fruits of the laborer, the farmer’s shroud;
The colors that flourish, a painter’s delight,
Embrace us in warmth as they bid us goodnight.

So let us cherish this season of grace,
As autumn unfolds at a languid pace;
For in every falling leaf, a story’s spun,
Of life’s endless circle, of daylight and sun.

- Thomas Bracken
