From silent depths of wood and glen,
The echoes of the wild arise;
The laughter of the trees and men,
All blend beneath the endless skies.

The song of night, the chirp of dawn,
The whispers in the heavenly light;
In nature’s court, love’s beauty drawn,
Resides in every heart so bright.


- William Browne
