A Walk in the Meadow

In the meadow, step lightly,
Where daisies blush and bloom,
Butterflies giggle past petals,
Dancing in nature's room.

Breeze carries laughter,
In whispers so sweet,
Be a moment's witness,
To life’s soundless heartbeat.

Wildflowers sway in colors,
Infinite and vibrant, too,
And as your spirit drifts,
You find a part of you.


- Richard Huelsenbeck
