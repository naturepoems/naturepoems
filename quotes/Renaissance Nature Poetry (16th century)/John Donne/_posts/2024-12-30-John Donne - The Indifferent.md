The Indifferent

I can love both fair and brown,
And even choose other styles,
And never let one glance go down
Upon some disfigured smiles.

I have momentary pleasure,
To see the setting sun
Or the heart of summer’s treasure,
Beyond a friend, or anyone.

To stocked deli meat, I'd dare
A lone, pure botanical heart,
For in my mind I find all rare
To love—a task I can impart!

E'en rust, sun-dried, won't divide me
From the love I do instate.
I pant to grasp, but no force blind me,
So,—in love may I relate.

Moor us in all that’s not confined,
With some love’s delicate page,
And let no difference show the mind
Which forms indifferent’s gay grudge — 
My flowers dance upon release!

- John Donne
