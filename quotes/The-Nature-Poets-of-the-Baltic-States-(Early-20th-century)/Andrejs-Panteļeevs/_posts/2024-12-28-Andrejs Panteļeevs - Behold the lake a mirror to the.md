Behold the lake, a mirror to the sky,
Reflecting the whispers of clouds above,
In tranquil depths, where time slows by,
The heartbeat of earth is a song of love.

Water lilies bloom in serene repose,
While dragonflies flit like stars turned to flight,
In this wondrous realm, beauty bestows,
A moment of peace in the fading light.

- Andrejs Panteļeevs
