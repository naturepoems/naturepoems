The Green Shutter

A yellow moonlight rests upon the lake,
A proud moon giveth rise back to its side,
Where the breeze hath gently swept and rolled to wake:
To the sweetness of green, the darkness abide.

The path graced by the beams, a soft unheard light,
Where the pale glades twist the haze, as I go,
And the garden sways with the night—so they come at sight;
While the latitudes swing their lonesome in tow.

Lift the shingle with your pale knees’ gentle grace,
And each glimmer shall mark anew this place,—
Yet a burst of the night’s strong foliage still sparce,
With lilunners that blacken circled to shawl.
Though the body must roam where the spirit draws wide.
O green, green shadows, my heart does abide!

- John Masefield
