The Fig Tree
When I read
of the fig tree,
that gave its fruit and offered shade,
I thought how wise it is to rest
a little,
to root deeper,
and store to this day,
all of what one needs.
I am learning,
in silence,
to wait for another blossom,
a moment yet to come;
there is a patience in the air,
a sweetness hanging,
waiting for my heart—
and the fig tree blooming, shines,
in its own way—
a gathering of lights—all around me, all around.

- Mary Oliver
