Under the vast and endless sky,
An eagle writes upon the wind;
Its wings, outstretched as truth, 
Carving lines through the padding clouds.

I stand on the edge of the world,
Feeling the storm’s breath pulse through the trees,
And in these moments where silence reigns,
I grasp the eternal spirit of nature,
And hear the wild calling my name.

- Richard Aldington
