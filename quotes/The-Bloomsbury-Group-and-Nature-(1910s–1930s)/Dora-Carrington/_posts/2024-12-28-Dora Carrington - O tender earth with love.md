O tender earth, with love imbued,
Your valleys cradle gentle mood,
Each blade of grass a hidden sigh,
In quiet shadows, spaces lie.
The mountains guard the whispers low,
As rivers twist and breezes flow;
Here creatures great and small abide,
Among your folds and secret stride.

With azure skies and warming sun,
Each day that dawns, a work begun,
The petals stretch and sunbeams play,
Emotions rise as night melts day.
O fragrant blooms that kiss the air,
And fragrant life that lingers there,
Nature enfolds me, and warms, 
With calm embrace through all the storms.

- Dora Carrington
