I love to see the skies a-glow,
   And every tree unfold its bloom;
I love the soft and fragrant air,
   The sunshine's gentle beam of gloom.

The dewdrops in the morning light,
   The sweet and fragrant evening air,
I love to feel the flowers bright
   And bask beneath the sun's warm glare.

- Adelaide Anne Procter
