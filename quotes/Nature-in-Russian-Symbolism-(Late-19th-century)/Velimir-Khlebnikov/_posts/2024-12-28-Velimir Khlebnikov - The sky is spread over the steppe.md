The sky is spread over the steppe,  
a vast blue expanse,  
its endless wind,  
a touch of eternity,  
caressing the earth's old skin.  

Fields of golden wheat sway,  
a gentle wave of summer sun,  
each stalk whispers dreams  
of a bountiful harvest,  
a promise of life,  
renewed by the cycle of seasons.

- Velimir Khlebnikov
