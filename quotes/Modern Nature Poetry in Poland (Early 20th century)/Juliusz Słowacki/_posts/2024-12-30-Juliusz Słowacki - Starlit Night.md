The stars like diamonds, glimmering bright,
In the endless expanse of the night.
They whisper stories of old and wise,
Shining down with their watchful eyes.

The moon, a beacon in the dark,
Guiding wanderers with its spark.
Through the valleys and hills it weaves,
A tapestry of dreams, one believes.

Nature's canvas, painted in light,
Captivating hearts with sheer delight.
In stillness, I ponder the cosmic grace,
Among the wonders of this sacred space.


- Juliusz Słowacki
