To a Skylark

Hail to thee, blithe Spirit!
Bird thou never wert—
That from heaven, or near it,
Pourest thy full heart
In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.
Higher still and higher
From the earth thou springest
Like a cloud of fire;
The blue deep thou wingest,
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
In the golden lightning
Of the sunken sun,
O’er which clouds are brightening,
Thou dost float and run,
Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.
The pale stars are gone,
And the white sun is glowing.
As a budding tree that leans
Towards the radiant sky,
With a beauty so outgrown—
What rain beats upon—
Dew on ample flower.

— Percy Bysshe Shelley
