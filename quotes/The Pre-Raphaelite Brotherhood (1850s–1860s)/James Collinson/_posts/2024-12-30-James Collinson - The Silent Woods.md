The Silent Woods


  Oh, go to the silent woods!  
  The wild-thundering state as I vow;  
  The notes linger round like stunned,  
  As I welcome their bow — each brow  
  With headless song and full canopy,  
  To hold up the cries of despair;  
  I kneel there in sweet dim massivity  
  While the moor reaches as clouds in the bear.
