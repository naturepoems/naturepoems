Beneath the sky, the earth moves slowly,
passing, breathing the grasses,
opening flowers of painful sun,
each fold of dusk a chance to revisit
what the deep becomes.

In the quiet of fall,
come earth's closing and cradling
a bird sings. Between the notes,
you remember the rise, the bloom,
softly touching the dusk,
keeping faith all night long.

What is a world without a sing?
With hands warm from the makingâ€”
a tapestry in color,
it speaks like the wind.


- Muriel Rukeyser
