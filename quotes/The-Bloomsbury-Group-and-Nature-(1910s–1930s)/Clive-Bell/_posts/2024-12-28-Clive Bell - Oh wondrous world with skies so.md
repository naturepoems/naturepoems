Oh, wondrous world with skies so blue,
Each sunset paints a canvas new.
The mountains stand, steadfast and grand,
Guardians of all the promised land.

The rivers flow with a timeless grace,
Reflecting the clouds in their watery face.
In nature's arms, our souls unfold,
A sanctuary of peace, a bounty untold.

- Clive Bell
