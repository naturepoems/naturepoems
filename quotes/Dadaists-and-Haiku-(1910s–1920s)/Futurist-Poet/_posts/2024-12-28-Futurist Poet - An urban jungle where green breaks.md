author: Futurist Poet
quote: "An urban jungle where green breaks through,
A testament to life, ever new.
Sound and silence, a rhythmic play,
Nature etches its verses day by day.

Waves crash rhythmically on rock and sand,
Time defies, pulses slip from hand.
In this whirling dance, a truth resounds,
Dadaist whispers in nature's bounds."

An urban jungle where green breaks through,
A testament to life, ever new.
Sound and silence, a rhythmic play,
Nature etches its verses day by day.

Waves crash rhythmically on rock and sand,
Time defies, pulses slip from hand.
In this whirling dance, a truth resounds,
Dadaist whispers in nature's bounds.
