Love the woods above all things—  
Love with an open heart and eye!  
They build the songs of daisies, they make the day more fair,  
They bring us down to share!  

For tell me, nature bright!  
What song will answer now?  
With green so broad and lightened by  
The straying birds that plow—  

As life goes walking through,  
So many hands to hold  
This time is worth remembering like  
The thorns adorning gold.

- Robert Frost
