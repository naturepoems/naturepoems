Spring in the Valley

Awakened in the valley spring,
The clamor of renewal sings,
In every bud that dares to show,
And from the frozen earth, green flows.

Watch life emerge from hollow mould,
Where once lay silence, now life bold,
And rivers chant their lively song,
As beauty wakes the lethargy long.

Together, we rejoice and play,
In scented breezes of the day,
For in the dance of nature’s time,
We find our lives, in rhythm, rhyme.
—Louis MacNeice
