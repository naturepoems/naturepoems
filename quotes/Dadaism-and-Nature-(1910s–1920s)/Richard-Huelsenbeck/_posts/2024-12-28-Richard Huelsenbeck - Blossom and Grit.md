Blossom and Grit  
In the corner of my eye,  
a galaxy spins through  
the garden fraught with flowers—  
colors blurring,  
tiny explosions of life!  
A cosmos of petals,  
bright against the gloom.

Yet churned soil speaks loud,  
its grit a grounded tale,  
a struggle beneath,  
a foundation of despair  
breeding beauty each spring.  
Nature is chaos,  
a delicate balance,  
infinite shots of chaos  
affecting every heart.

- Richard Huelsenbeck
