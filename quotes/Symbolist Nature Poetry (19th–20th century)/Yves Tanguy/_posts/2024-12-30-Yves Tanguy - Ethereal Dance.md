The earthly mosaic, the clouds that soar,  
Under blue sky's radiant delight,  
Whispers of feathers, a soft alluring galore,  
Drawn in hues, the heart takes flight.

Curves entwined in sunlit turns,  
The dance of light and shadow play,  
In vibrant clusters, nature burns,  
A symphony played with colors' sway.

Rivers humming, cloaked in mist,  
Lingering leaves that sway and kiss,  
Each moment's fragrance, a gentle tryst,  
Life's tender spell in nature’s bliss.


- Yves Tanguy
