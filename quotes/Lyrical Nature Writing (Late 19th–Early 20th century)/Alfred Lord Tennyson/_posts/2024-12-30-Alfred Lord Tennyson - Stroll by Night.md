In the silence of the night we stroll,
  Beneath the vast celestial dome;
For in the woodlands, spirit whole,
  We seek our wandering home.

And in the perfumed air that wafts,
  The nightingale sings low;
For all the moments lull like draughts,
  Drenched in the moon’s soft glow.

O, Nature, thou art pure delight,
  Forever in this time most dear;
In the shadows of the whispering night,
  Let all our fears disappear.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
