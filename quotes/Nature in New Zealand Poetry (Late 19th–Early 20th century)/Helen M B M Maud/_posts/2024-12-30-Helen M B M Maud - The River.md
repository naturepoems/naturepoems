The River

Flowing gently, the river sings,
A lullaby, soft and sweet;
It weaves through banks like silken strings,
In nature’s arms, the heart finds beat.

With every turn, a story told,
Of whispers shared beneath the trees;
Of dreams set free, of love unfolds,
In liquid light, the soul’s release.

So listen close, the waters flow,
Their wisdom speaks to hearts awake;
In every drop, life’s undertow,
A river’s song, in peace we take.

- Helen M B M Maud
