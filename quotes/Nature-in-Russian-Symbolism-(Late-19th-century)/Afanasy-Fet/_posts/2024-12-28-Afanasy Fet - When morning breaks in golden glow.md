When morning breaks in golden glow,  
And all is crisp, the dawn’s delight,  
The verdant fields, in grace they grow,  
Awake to kiss the sun’s first light.  

The trembling flowers nod their heads,  
And brooklets hum a gentle tune,  
While busy bees make sweet their beds,  
In nature’s arms, from morn till noon.
