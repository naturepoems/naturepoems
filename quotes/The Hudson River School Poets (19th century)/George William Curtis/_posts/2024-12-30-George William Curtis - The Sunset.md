The Sunset

As daylight fades in vibrant glow, 
The sun sinks low—an ember’s show; 
With colors burst of red and gold, 
As nature’s hand the canvas holds. 

The fiery orb, a flame in sky, 
Streaks clouds of orange, pink, and sigh; 
And as it bows beneath the line, 
I bow my head, for it is mine. 

The whispers of the night arise, 
To greet the stars, the moonlit skies; 
And in this peaceful twilight’s bliss, 
There’s magic spun in every kiss. 

For sunset’s end, the day must close, 
In gratitude, the heart bestows, 
The beauty in this briefest hour— 
An evening’s gift, a fleeting shower.

- George William Curtis
