The Lark Ascending

A lark in flight, a melody,
Soars high above the verdant lea;
With wings outstretched, a song released,
In light of dawn, the spirit feasts.

Through azure skies, the notes do weave,
A tapestry none can perceive;
In beauty pure, the heart will swell,
In nature’s thrall, we find our spell.

Let every chord, a prayer of grace,
Resound through all the sacred space;
For in the lark's ascendance bright,
We find our hope, our deep delight.


- Philip Webb
