In a meadow where the wildflowers grow,
Colors burst beneath the sun’s embrace,
A canvas where the soft winds blow,
In nature’s heart, I find my space.

Butterflies weave paths in the air,
With laughter dancing on the breeze,
In this moment, nothing compares,
To the peace that nature leaves.

- Vanessa Bell
