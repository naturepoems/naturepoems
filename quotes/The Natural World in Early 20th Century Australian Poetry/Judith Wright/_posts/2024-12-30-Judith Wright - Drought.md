Drought

Dust dances in the searing light,
Where the land looks lost and dry,
The sky a heavy metal blue;
Underneath the shade, I feel
The stretch of distance,
Where everything holds its breath.

We wait for whispers of rain,
For the gentle touch of life,
But the earth remains steadfast
With its secrets deep, binding
The sorrow of seasons.


- Judith Wright
