Fog  
  
  
The fog creeps low, a ghostly tide,  
That veils the world in silver gray,  
With whispers soft it swathes the land,  
In quiet dance of end-of-day.  
  
Each tree, a spectre in the mist,  
The path obscured, the air grows cold,  
A haunting silence blankets all,  
As stories of the night unfold.  
  
Beyond the veil the stars await,  
As flickers of the daylight fade,  
In dusky shades, a realm of dreams,  
The fog conceals, then softly fades.

- EJ Pratt
