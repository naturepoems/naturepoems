I traveled among unknown men,
In lands beyond the sea:
Nor, England! did I know till then
What love I bore to thee.

'Tis past, that I may feel its worth:
But how could I forget thee?
The mountains, valleys, beauties of earth,
They come back to me as I see..

I cannot rest in a strange land;
My heart is with thee, old friend:
From the shores I wander, the treasure I hold,
For thou, my England, I cannot defend.

These lands, unknown, yet they draw me near;
As the crest of the sun greets the stream,
My home in heart I hold so dear,
Such love consumes, so profound, so extreme.

- William Wordsworth
