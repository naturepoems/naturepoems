The peace of wild things
   is the peace of the wild,
   it is a quiet beauty.
I go among the trees and sit still.
   All my attention seems to go
   into the softness of the grass,
   the quiet of the leaves.

   I let go of my burdens,
   and in that moment,
   I hear the earth breathe under me.
   I see the sky stretching,
   I smell the moss, the bark,
   and the dust beneath my feet.

   There is a restoration
   in every silence, every bloom.
   I have come to understand
   that I am creature, and so
   I give thanks for every leaf,
   every drop of rain, and the sun
   that warms the cool stone.

- Wendell Berry
