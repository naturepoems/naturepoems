The First Snow
 
As the first snow falls, with its feathery grace,
It blanketed the world, in a soft white lace;
Mapping the landscape with a crystalline sheet,
Transforming the ordinary into a retreat.
 
Each flake whispers secrets, so delicate, rare,
Nature's gentle touch, in the cool winter air;
Fields dressed in white, under still starlight glow,
Awakens the heart, in the chill and the snow.
 
So let us gather, in the warmth of our hearts,
Embrace by the fire, let the cold world depart;
For in winterâ€™s quiet, a beauty unfolds,
In each flake that glistens, new stories are told.

- Henry James Pye
