The Spirit of the Forest

In the heart of the forest deep,
Where ancient trees stand tall and wide,
The echoes of the wild still leap,
With whispers of the earth’s pride.

Each shadow holds a timeless tale,
Of creatures small and great and wise,
A sanctuary that will not fail,
Where nature shares her softest sighs.


- A R D Fairburn
