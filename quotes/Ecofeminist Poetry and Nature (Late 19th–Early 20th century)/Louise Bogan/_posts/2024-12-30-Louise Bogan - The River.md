The River  
Rolling in the silence,  
   the river whispers  
to the gathered stones  
   of moss and water-worn dreams.  
It calls to me,  
   its voice a cool embrace  
   against my skin,  
leading me gently,  
   down the path  
     of fading echoes  
   and last ledges of light.

- Louise Bogan
