The Midnight Moon

The midnight moon, a silver hue,
Casts shadows soft upon the ground,
In quiet woods, where dreams renew,
A symphony of peace surrounds.

With every beam, it softly sheds,
A light that whispers to the night,
And lulls the world to gentle beds,
Beneath its watchful, tender light.

- Marigold Johnson
