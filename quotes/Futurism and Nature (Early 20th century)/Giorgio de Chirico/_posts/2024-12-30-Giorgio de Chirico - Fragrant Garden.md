On the way to the fragrant garden, 
Pathways twist under arching trees,
Yonder, a glimpse of flowers in motion,
Their vivid palette paints a warm embrace.

In gentle solitude, one can breathe, 
Natureâ€™s breath entwining with thought, 
Every petal a fragile lighthouse, 
Guiding hearts lost in the stormy seas.

While the sun jealously hugs the horizon, 
Casting shadows that stretch and sigh,
Life awakens in the fervent dusk,
A painting by fingers of the divine.

- Giorgio de Chirico
