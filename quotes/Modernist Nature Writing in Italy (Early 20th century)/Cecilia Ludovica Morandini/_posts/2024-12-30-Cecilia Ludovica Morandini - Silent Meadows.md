Silent Meadows

In the early light,
meadows stretch like endless dreams,
where dew clings to blades of grass,
glistening like jewels beneath the sun.
Wildflowers bloom in bursts of color,
a canvas splashed with natureâ€™s palette,
the air fragrant with life,
a symphony of scents and hues.

Here in silence, we find refuge,
a sanctuary for weary souls,
a place where whispers fade,
a moment stolen from the rush of time.

- Cecilia Ludovica Morandini
