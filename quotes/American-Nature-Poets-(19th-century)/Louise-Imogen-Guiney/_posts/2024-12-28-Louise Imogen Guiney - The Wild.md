The Wild Rose
A wild rose blooms by the garden gate,
Untamed and free, it holds no fate,
Its petals soft, a blush so deep,
In quiet corners, secrets keep.
With fragrance sweet, it draws the breeze,
And dances lightly among the trees.
A simple beauty, fierce and bright,
A testament to nature's light.

- Louise Imogen Guiney
