The Trees, like Corners, creaked and writhed  
Beneath the landed Eyes –  
They gaze with wonder, ever peering  
At Nature’s quite surprise –  

And thus across, the Heaven glowed  
Where the Clouds might seem to feign,  
As one has walked draped in the fire  
That seems not full of pain –  

Are these but bits and fragments,  
The dawn of every Sleep –  
Unfolding still, the vision  
Nature wants us to keep?  

This Milk-white Casket holds the world,  
Though it can’t foresee the Day;  
Yet every piece of Beauty  
Doth always choose to stay –  

And still invite the Glory  
The wonder overcomes  
The sorrow, cries, and whispers  
Of every fine, in sums –  

A dwindling hazel waits too long  
Till the day it dries an eye;  
And still the shrubs continue play  
In summer, passing by –  

And Nature’s endless harmony  
Discerns the hearts of Fruits;  
That rise and fall, in every shape –  
The blooming of our Roots!

- Emily Dickinson
