The Tuft of Flowers
I went to turn the grass once after one  
Who mowed it in the dew before the sun.  
The dew was gone that made his blade so gleam,  
And, as I went to clear away the leaves,  
I found a tuft of flowers,  
That just to see this beauty once again.  

The morning light of reason was in it,  
I knew the man who had gone out together  
He wove high grass and walked overhead;  
The leaning boughs were bent beneath his hand  
And still remained  
A room for the touchfinding of a day.  

The flying dew would witness the hour,  
The shadows would ask what they meant,  
Leaving the empty wood behind.  

These flowers spoke in tenderness  
As you are lost without a woolly coat  
While others seemed happier  
To share this burden of the morn.  

Their shapes would lift the imagination high,  
And as I will heighten my soul to heights that are above  
I will bring these tufts of flowers back  
To you, as a fleeting charm  
That loves a moment, and brings it home.

- Robert Frost
