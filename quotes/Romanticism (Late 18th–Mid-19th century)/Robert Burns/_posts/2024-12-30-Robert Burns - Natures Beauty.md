Through woods and glades I often tread,
Where singing birds take rest,
And humble flowers, bloom in red,
To scent the evening’s zest.

The brook, it dances on the stone,
With waters pure and bright;
It sings a song, for love alone,
When day gives way to night.

So come, my love, and walk with me,
Through fragrant paths untried;
As nature’s beauty sets us free,
Our hearts shall be the guide.

- Robert Burns
