The splendor of sunset sings through the pines,  

As the day slips away in a blush of gold hue,  

The stars, timid dancers, begin to align,  

In the lap of the twilight, I think of the blue.


Oh heart, can you feel this dance of delight?  

Nature wraps us, a cloak, soft and dear,  

Whispering secrets as day turns to night,  

In the stillness of evening, all sorrows endear.

- Alice Dunbar-Nelson
