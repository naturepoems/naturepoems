The morning dew clings to the grass,
Diamonds scattered, light refracts,
In every moment, hours trespass,
Natureâ€™s voice, with zest it acts.

The rustling leaves, a gentle sigh,
A whisper from the depths of green,
Each breeze that passes, me and I,
Part of the world, a part unseen.

- Antonio Marastoni
