Engines roar, a symphony of might,
In the heart of progress, where dreams take flight,
Yet quietly, nature makes her plea,
In the cracks of asphalt, the roots run free.

Concrete jungles, electric night,
Yet somewhere blooms a wildflowerâ€™s light,
Hope in the cracks, where green meets gray,
In this battleground, life finds a way.

From the mountains high to oceans deep,
Nature whispers secrets, safe to keep,
Embrace the balance, the fusion, the dance,
In the modern world, let love take a chance.

- Futurista A B C
