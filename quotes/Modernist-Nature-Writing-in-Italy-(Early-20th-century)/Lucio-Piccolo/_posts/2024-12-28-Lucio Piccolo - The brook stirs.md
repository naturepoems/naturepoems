The brook stirs softly,
a trickle of laughter amidst the stones,
its path laid out, meandering,
away from the haste of mortal things.
With every lap, it writes a story,
a daily romance hidden in the current,
caresses the roots of willow,
grazes past the rushes, lost in thought.

Stillness lies deep beneath the surface,
and fish dart like whispered wishes,
flitting away, just brushed by the thought
of discovery along the banks of time.

Here, I find solace,
a tranquil heart swelling with the murmur,
as the whispering reeds hold their sentries,
dancing in the kiss of the breeze,
a meeting of moments lingering forever,
as the brook wanders on, ever more brave.

- Lucio Piccolo
