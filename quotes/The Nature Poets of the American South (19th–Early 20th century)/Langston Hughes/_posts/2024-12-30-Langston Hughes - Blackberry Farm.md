Blackberry Farm
In the black garden,
crows, crows,
everywhere black crows.
The ground under them is soft;
it seems to breathe,
the roof is high and low at once.

Children run around
in the sun and the rain,
alternating, like the day,
a coming of night or day.
A cottage full of sweetness,
a cottage full of flowers.  

But we are old now,
do you know:
We’ve known too many blackbirds,
too many crows
in the garden.

Do you remember
where the flowers grew?
Let’s remember, let’s remember.



- Langston Hughes
