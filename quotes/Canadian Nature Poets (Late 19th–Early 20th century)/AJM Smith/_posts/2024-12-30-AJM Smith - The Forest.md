The Forest

Beneath the arch of ancient trees,
   Where sunlight filters down, a golden hand,
The mysteries of life bring gentle ease,
   As shadows dance upon the woodland stand.

Here age-old roots in tenderness entwine,
   In whispers, share the tales of time’s embrace,
While woodland creatures roam, a life divine,
   In harmony, they find their sacred space.

And as I walk, my heart becomes a dove,
   Free in the lightness of this timeless place,
In the silence, I discover life, and love,
   In nature's arms, I breathe, I trace.

- AJM Smith
