The Noontide

    At noontide, when the sun doth shine,
    And summer's warmth enfolds,
    I wander where the trees entwine,
    With whispers soft and bold.

    The flowers laugh, the waters play,
    And all of life is bright;
    In every leaf, in every ray,
    Nature is pure delight.

    So let me linger, sweet and free,
    In this embrace of day,
    For in the joy of you and me,
    The world will fade away.

- George Meredith
