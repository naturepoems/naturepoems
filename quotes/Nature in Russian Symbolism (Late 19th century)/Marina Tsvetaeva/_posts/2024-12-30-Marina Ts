The forest cradles twilight  
      In haunting shades;  
   Where paths of forgotten tales  
      Despair to treadâ€”  
Each sigh against the leaves  
   A testament to the lost  
And lingering shadows  
      Of an ancient moon,  
In the crack of night,  
    The wind sings  
      A soft lullaby,  
Kisses to the unseen world  
   As the echoes plunge  
     Like a cast net,  
And I, searching the depths  
      For remnants of dreams.

- Marina Tsvetaeva
