When autumn winds begin to sigh,
And paint the leaves in fiery hues,
I wander where the shadows lie,
And gather peace from natureâ€™s dues.
The earth transforms, yet holds its charm,
Each sunset whispers to the pines;
With every chill, I feel the warm,
Embrace of life, where beauty shines.


- Gustave Flaubert
