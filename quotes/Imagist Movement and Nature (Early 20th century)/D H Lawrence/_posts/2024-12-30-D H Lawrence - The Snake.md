The Snake

   A snake came in the grass,
   It was a long, cool slink of a green thing,
   Slithering along, at home in the green,
   Ambivalence in its body, a soft sigh in its mind.
   It was so cool, creeping, crawling,
   I watched its nimbleness and saw the palm leaves' depth.
  Though my heart said, O fear! I hunkered still, ready,
  I had a thing for the wild, and it was warm,
   Nothing could be truer on so warm a ground.
   The snake turned its face, saw me there at shore,
   And went on, a phantom on the verdant breath,
   Scattering the thought of scales like glitter on warm.  


- D H Lawrence
