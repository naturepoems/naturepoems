quote: "The Dew
Each drop a mirror, capturing the day’s first rays,
Hanging delicately upon the blades of grass,
A fleeting moment of perfection, then lost,
As the sun rises, urging life forth."

The Dew
Each drop a mirror, capturing the day’s first rays,
Hanging delicately upon the blades of grass,
A fleeting moment of perfection, then lost,
As the sun rises, urging life forth.

- Francis Ponge
