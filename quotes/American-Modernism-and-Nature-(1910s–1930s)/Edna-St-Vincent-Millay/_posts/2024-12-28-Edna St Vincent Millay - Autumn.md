Autumn Song

O hushed and aching requiem of my heart, 
    My heart! the whispering lilac’s from the bark, 
For heaven is an emerald where I grew, 
    Lintel of the sky; the woods are dark. 
Reach, poet, reach! I am the violets unseen.
    Dusk of the branches aglow, 
For autumn dusk is breathless, and even
    Fallen leaves of the moonlight’s glow.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
