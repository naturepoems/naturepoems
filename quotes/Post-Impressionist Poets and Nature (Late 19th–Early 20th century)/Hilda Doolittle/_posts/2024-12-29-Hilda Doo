Spring

Oh, the way you twirl,
    a dance of newness
    unbound and alive,
    your laughter tinkles
    through the gardens,
    lighting every corner
    with your vibrant shades.
You invite the blossoms
    to join in a symphony,
    while your breath
    warms the village green,
    coaxing every life
    from slumbering stillness
    into the gleeful chatter
    of your arrival.
Oh Spring, eternal muse,
    sing your sweet song
to the tired, aching worlds,
    remind them how to bloom,
    how to love without bounds.

- Hilda Doolittle
