Celestial Laughter  
Stars gather in rebellion,  
a riot of light spilling  
across the velvet canvas,  
a thousand eyes gaze down,  
while the world below  
holds its breath.

I find solace  
in this heavenly explosion,  
a liquid laughter  
bathing the night,  
a gentle reminder  
of the divine  
that brushes across  
our mundane chaos.

What art have they inspired?  
Who watches whom?  
An endless exchange!  
Here, we twine  
in the cosmic charade,  
where conclusions take flight.

- Richard Huelsenbeck
