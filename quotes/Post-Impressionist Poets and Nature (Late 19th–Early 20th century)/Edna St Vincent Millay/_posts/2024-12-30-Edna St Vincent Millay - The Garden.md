The Garden

In the middle of the night, every creature sleeps,
Soft woods put down their faces; patience keeps
The breath of dawn within, I observe,
And wonder at light that wrapped us up so soon!
The colorful spiders stretch warm webs 

And coiled are like wild vines along the lapis fields;
And then those stars recall the song of meandering suns,
The troves from above—your golden hair,
Oh love, led to the bloom, of flowers -

Your laughter-string resonated like a flute,
And every petal now is praise—a track, a haloed ring—
That dances ‘round the moonlight where
Among light-turned hearts—all allow.

- Edna St Vincent Millay
