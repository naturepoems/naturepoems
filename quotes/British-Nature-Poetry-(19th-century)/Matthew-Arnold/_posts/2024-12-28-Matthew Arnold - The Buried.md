The Buried Life

Call it a day, he said, and in the toughest of the night,
As shadows crawl back, creep past the old light.
The trees in the garden whisper back to him
Their voices dimmed with echoes that may swim.

We go on alone, as winsome stars glide
Through lonely worlds, through an infinite ride.
Yet here, behind this thorny wall—we should know
The kind of joy that wisdom flows.

Can you not see where shadows hide?
The moments we seek can land amiss,
For truth is lost on paths too wide,
Yet hope grows fertile where love must kiss.

Come to the edge, join us here! Let the starlit feel,
Run where desires lie, deep and still,
Let’s lose ourselves to these souls of the gentle field,
And play with nature’s light, hope’s warm fire of will.

- Matthew Arnold
