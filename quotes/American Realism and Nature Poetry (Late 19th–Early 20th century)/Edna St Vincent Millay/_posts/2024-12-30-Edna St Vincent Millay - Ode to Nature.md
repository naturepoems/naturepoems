Ode to the fleeting moments we share,
Beneath the boughs, with fragrant air.
The world, ablaze in colors bright,
In Nature’s arms, our hearts take flight.

Together we explore the woodlands wide,
In every stream we cast aside,
The world beyond, the noise, the scorn,
In Nature’s cradle, love is born.


- Edna St Vincent Millay
