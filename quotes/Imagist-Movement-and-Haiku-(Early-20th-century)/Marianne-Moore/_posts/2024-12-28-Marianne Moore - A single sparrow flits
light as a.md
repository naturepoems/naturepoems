author: Marianne Moore
quote: "A single sparrow flits,
light as a thought, darting free,
its wings—a heartbeat,
shyly sipping dew drops,
as dawn unfurls the day,
its song—a delicate sigh,
a reminder of life in pause."

A single sparrow flits,
light as a thought, darting free,
its wings—a heartbeat,
shyly sipping dew drops,
as dawn unfurls the day,
its song—a delicate sigh,
a reminder of life in pause.

- Marianne Moore
