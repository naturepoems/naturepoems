The Mountains

Beneath the vastness,
the mountains rise,
a monument to time,
a testament to nature's will.

Their crags and crevasses
hold the whispers of eons,
each layer a story,
a fusion of stone and sky.

Here, in silence,
the soul finds refuge,
a communion with the elements
as the air thickens with the scent
of pine and earth.

From high above,
the world stretches thin,
boundless and infinite,
each peak a point of contact,
a reminder of the most simple truths,
a song of the earth
written in granite.

--- Umberto Boccioni
