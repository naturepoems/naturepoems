Eternal Cycle
Rivers flow and mountains rise,
Underneath the vast, blue skies.
Life’s a circle, both old and new,
In nature's hands, we’re born anew.

From the earth, we come; to it, we go,
In every seed, a tale to sow.
An endless dance, the world’s embrace,
In nature’s heart, we find our place.


- Antonio SantElia
