where roots clutch stones in a lover’s embrace,
a necklace of flowers lingers at dusk's door,
carpet of green spreads in nature's flow."

Among the ancient trees, the shadows grow,
where roots clutch stones in a lover’s embrace,
a necklace of flowers lingers at dusk's door,
carpet of green spreads in nature's flow.
