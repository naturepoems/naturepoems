I saw a swan glide smoothly
across a still lake,
a reflection of beauty,
silent and serene.
Its feathers white
like fluffy clouds,
a vision of grace
in the early morn.
The breeze carries secrets,
a soft caress,
while ripples break
against the banks.
Natureâ€™s canvas,
painted with silence,
pure and pristine,
a moment held,
a breath taken,
within a heart's memory.
