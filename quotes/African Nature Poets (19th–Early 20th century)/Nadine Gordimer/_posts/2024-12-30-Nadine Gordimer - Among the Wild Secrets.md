Among the secrets of the wild,
there’s a tale waiting to be told,
a stillness erases the past,
a promise beckons you forward,
each flower a beacon of hope.

Let nature play her part
in our understanding,
a verse crafted in silence,
a rhythm forged from wind,
find these lingering moments
of a life rich with wonder.

We will meet somewhere,
where all worlds collide,
the flourishing beyond despair,
the growth of spirit.
Let’s walk among the paths,
as they twine into infinity.

- Nadine Gordimer
