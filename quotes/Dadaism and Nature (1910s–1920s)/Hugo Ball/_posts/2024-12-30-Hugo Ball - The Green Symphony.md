The Green Symphony
A symphony of colors blooms
Like the heart of a daisy,
From the dark soil of our unsung past,
Praising the sun's gallant arms,
While shadows fall away
Into soft melodies borne on the breeze.

The air sings in brilliant tones,
Aromas mingle sweetly in laughter,
While grass performs a jig so wise,
Crickets chirp the songs of the ensorcelled night,
Cloaked in secrets of long-forgotten tales.

- Hugo Ball
