I could not go, for I did not fear
As lent back, for moments shared,  
With smile and laughter all our days,
And not a day too soon left unsaid.

The years that vanish o'er the wall
Are all my dreams, o'er lonesome calls,
To sing outside a fairer well,
Where all that sings must rise and fell.

- A E Housman
