Petting Zoo

The reeds are neither unseen
in the sun,
where the swamp-glare is too sharp
not to exist.

Under Popsicles and the dew, it plagues
ordinary shoal of a lily's princely
river with feebler marks, 

throats miraculously sprout,
with fragrance and only jerk
from the vine, but  still

head to hoof grey, but even gold poses
a thoughtful fall of rabbits you probably
cannot guess at that.

There is the yield
beneath outside hollers
between trains: rancor, that kept burn.

—Marianne Moore
