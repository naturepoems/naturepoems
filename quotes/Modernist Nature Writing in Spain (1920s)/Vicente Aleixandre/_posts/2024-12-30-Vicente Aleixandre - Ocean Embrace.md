To discover the ocean,
large and blue,
churning, a breath,
a heartbeat unexplored,
at every wave,
ever crest,
it rumbles and sings,
it invites you,
sun on your skin,
is it so far from the shore?
Will you touch what has been,
call the shadows aside?

There lies the essence, my love,
where stillness drifts in loveâ€™s embrace.

- Vicente Aleixandre
