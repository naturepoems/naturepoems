Upon the hill where the wild thyme grows,
The breeze carries whispers of long-lost prose;
A tapestry woven from moments of grace,
In the quiet embrace of this sacred place.

Each flower a story, each stone a song,
In the wild of the world where I truly belong.
With every heartbeat, the earth draws me near,
In the wilderness' cradle, I cast off my fear.

- David Jones
