Mountains touch the sky's blue veil,
Ancient sentinels, rugged and pale;
Their snow-capped crowns, a royal decree,
Guardians of wilderness, timeless and free.

Each chasm and valley, a story untold,
In the arms of nature, I behold;
Majestic heights, a humbling sight,
In their shadows, I fathom my plight.


- Henry James
