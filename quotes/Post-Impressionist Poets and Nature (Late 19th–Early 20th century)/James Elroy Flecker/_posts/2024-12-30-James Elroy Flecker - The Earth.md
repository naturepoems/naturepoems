The Earth

The Earth is but a lovely thing, 
Her skies are blue and bright, 
Her fields are met with endless dreams, 
That waltz in pure delight.

The rivers sing as they run by, 
Through forests thick and deep, 
Where every ray of light shall play, 
And weave a song of sleep.

The mountain peaks in splendor rise, 
Like guardians from above, 
In their embrace, the world awakes, 
To beauty, life, and love.

- James Elroy Flecker
