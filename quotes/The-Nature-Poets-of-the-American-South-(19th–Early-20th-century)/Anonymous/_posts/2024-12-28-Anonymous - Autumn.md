Autumn Leaves

The autumn leaves, like flames of gold,  
Are whispering the winter’s tale;  
In rustling sounds, the earth grows bold,  
As crispness shrouds the gentle vale.  

They twirl and dance upon the ground,  
A carpet rich, a fleeting sight;  
Each leaf a memory, love profound,  
As day gives way to starry night.
