Awake, O heart! The dawn is nigh,
With golden rays that pierce the sky;
The songbirds stir with notes of cheer,
As springtime blooms its beauty near.
Embrace the light, the warmth, the grace,
In natureâ€™s world, we find our place;
For every day is a gift divine,
In harmony, our spirits shine.

- Robert Southwell
