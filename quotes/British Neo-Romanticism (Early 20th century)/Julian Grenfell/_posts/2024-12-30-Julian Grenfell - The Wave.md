The Wave
I stood and watched the sunlight play
On the sapphire surface of the sea,
Where waves, like children, dance and leap,
In laughter bright and spirits free.
Each crest that breaks with joyous foam,
Seemed to sing of life and peace,
Its whispers carried to the shore,
Where the soul finds utter ease.



- Julian Grenfell
