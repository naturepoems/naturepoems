The Sun  

Have you ever seen the sun,  
     bright and gold,  
     dripping down like honey?  
     Have you ever watched it rise,  
     grow slow and very thick,  
     filling the sky with warmth?  
     It is a deep treasure,  
     a warming glow,  
     a quiet moment for your heart.  
     Feel it on your skin,  
     taste it like syrup,  
     let it wrap around you  
     like a great tenderness.  
     Oh, the sun—  
     it knows all our strengths,  
     our unformed dreams,  
     our longings.  
     Dance in its light,  
     in its fierce embrace—  
     and become  
     the light  
     you seek.

- Mary Oliver
