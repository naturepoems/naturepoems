quote: "A single leaf twirls  
down from the old oak’s arms,  
carrying tales of the seasons,  
a witness to time gone by.  
Each twist, each drop,  
a note in nature’s song—  
it speaks of life’s turning."

A single leaf twirls  
down from the old oak’s arms,  
carrying tales of the seasons,  
a witness to time gone by.  
Each twist, each drop,  
a note in nature’s song—  
it speaks of life’s turning.
