Beneath the boughs, the weary rest,  
In the shade of the ancient trees,  
Nature, with her tender breast,  
Wraps us in her sweet decrees.
  
Where shadows play and light retreats,  
A harmony of breath and sound,  
The world within her arms, complete,  
In nature's love, we are unbound.


- Friedrich Hölderlin
