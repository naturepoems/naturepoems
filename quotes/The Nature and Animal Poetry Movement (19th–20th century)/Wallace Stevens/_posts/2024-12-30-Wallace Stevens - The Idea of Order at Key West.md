The Idea of Order at Key West

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind
Of man; it is more than mere water,
But once in a while, like the wind, it calls out.
Smart sea, smart night—there must be other calls.
Rain-making might, men’s powers should try.

Faith sings deep, in the darkness evoking
All the living things, snakes, toucans, eldoradoes,
Curious fates in ruin, making life-ways,
Bringing them all to the sea. 

In the glow of light round rocks,
The fish and the people are both decorous; 
She is the one, lighted in her thoughts,
Bringing order to the chaos—so soft.
Transition; the desires emerge.
How does the sea call? What presumption!

The sea exists for her, the voice she knows.
Forever must it echo; grandeur sounds its pain.
O beware the great roar of the sea, 
Or be it the one who shapes with timeless thinking— 
From each movement, for her.
This is but an illusion, I'm sure
Made of a light too tender, too glistening. 

The sun has risen and descended too:
The darkness grieves and sighs—how overwhelming this night!
All her sounds awaken the living cycle
And all cries meet including dreams adrift for beings.
So let it be. Nothing more, the sea, kindly.”
