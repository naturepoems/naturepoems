Clouds billowing like thoughts,
Float across the azure dome,
Softened by echoes, wandering. 
Each one a whisper,
A prayer sent aloft.
I stand in reverence,
With arms opened wide,
Embracing the elegance,
Of a world dressed in light.
Here under skies vast and wide,
I discover myself.

               – From "Skyward"

- Annie Dillard
