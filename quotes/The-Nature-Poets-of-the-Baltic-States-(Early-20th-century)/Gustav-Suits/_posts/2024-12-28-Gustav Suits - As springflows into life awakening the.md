As springflows into life, awakening the ground,
green carpets unfurl, in beauty abound.
Each blade of fresh grass, each flower profound,
bears witness to natureâ€™s rejoicing sound.

The thrush performs sonatas from leafy retreats,
and blossoms unfurl, offering bountiful sweets.
In the warmth of the sun, new days brightly unfold,
as the tapestry of life spins brightly and bold.
