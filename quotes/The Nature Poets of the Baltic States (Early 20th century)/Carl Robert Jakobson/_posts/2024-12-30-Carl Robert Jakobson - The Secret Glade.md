The Secret Glade  
Hidden from paths  
that wander and stray,  
a secret glade  
where softly we play.  
With laughter of petals  
that flutter in glee,  
whispers of nature's  
most delicate plea.  
In the silence it beckons,  
a world all its own,  
a sanctuary alive,  
a place to atone.

- Carl Robert Jakobson
