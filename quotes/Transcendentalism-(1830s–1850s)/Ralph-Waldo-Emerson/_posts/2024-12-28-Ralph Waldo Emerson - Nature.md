Nature

   I
   The greatest delight which the fields and woods minister, is the suggestion of an occult relationship between man and the vegetable.

   I say, the grass is a great mother; by any other name she would still be a flower.
   The air is full of love, riding on the leaves, folding each petal in sweet confidence.
   Nature is the world’s best book, a living volume in serene, everlasting beauty.

   II
   I believe that life is good;
   That the fireflies still play,
   And the stars are nearer than they seem.

   If we but listen to the whispers of the flower,
   We shall make our practical, our joy, our very existence,
   And grow like vines in deepening solitude.

                                             —Ralph Waldo Emerson
