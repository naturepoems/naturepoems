the tree speaks in whispers
that ripple through the leaves
like laughter in the shadows
of a fading sun,
as I walk on the edge
of this soft, green earth,

life pulses beneath my feet    
singing the songs of forgotten rivers
and breathing in the scents
of wild jasmine and old pine.

I am intertwined with the wind,
my thoughts ride the currents,
travel the skies,
rest in the gentle lap of rain,

and here I find my heart,
echoes of twilight
forever swirling in the air.

Bali Hai

when Bali Hai beckons
like a lover’s soft kiss,
a paradise submerged
in ocean’s deep embrace,
you dance along the foam
of waves kissing the shore,

seagulls wheel and cry
as palm trees sway their
ancient secrets to the wind,
flirting with the sun,
a golden jewel that
hugs the horizon.

you breathe in the salt
and let it fillet your spirit,
for the earth spins like
an endless carnival wheel,
spiraling through the stars

while you stand rooted
in the beauty of the moment,
aware of the miracles that
sprout between each breath,

where the sea kisses the sky,
and dreams float on whirlwinds.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


The River’s Song

in the lullaby of the river,
every stone has a story,
every ripple a forgotten dream,
whispers of the ancients
who danced in the flow
of endless currents.

trace your fingers
along the cool water’s skin,
and hear the melodies
that weave through the shadows —
tales of lovers
who let go
into the embrace of surrender,
to drift into the arms
of time’s soft passage.

remember the oak trees
that once stood watch,
their roots intertwined
with the wisdom of years,
guardians of the silence
that lingered long after,
waiting for the songs
that slipped like stardust
into the heart of the night.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


Autumn Leaves

leaf by leaf
      the world releases its secrets,
  a blaze of colors
        drapes the dusk in fire.
like whispered prayers,
    they dance and flutter,
      cloaked in the melancholy
of a fading summer.

beneath the weight of time,
  branches sway,
  reminisce the laughter
  of the swaying grass
and the delicate blush
      of the sky at dawn.

in the crunch of footsteps,
    I hear their stories,
       the warmth of autumn
          wraps around my soul,
and I am lost in the embrace
of what was once
    and what has yet to come.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


Whispers of the Ocean

the ocean sings
in the language of eternity,
each wave a caress
    on the weary heart,
while the horizon stretches
    like a dancer,
boundless and free,
waiting to reveal
    its mysteries to eager eyes.

sand sifts through fingers
like time slipping away,
with every footprint plunged
    in the soft embrace
of that golden grain,

tides rise and recede,
    as the moon pulls
from the depths
        the secrets of the deep,
  and the stars lean down
        to listen.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


Garden of Dreams

a garden in my mind
where colors bloom
  like thoughts let loose,
fragrance swirling with hope,
a secret language spoken
  only to the brave.

butterflies dance,
    delicate whispers
in the daylight,
flirting with the nectar
      of possibility,
young voices of tomorrow
    sing on the breeze,

and the soil breathes
       beneath their hovering wings,
carrying the light
      back to the roots,
where dreams take flight
  on wings of subtle grace.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


The Sky's Embrace

the sky is wide,
a canvas holding stars,
yet it whispers soft tales
to the mountains who stand proud,
    guarding the horizon’s dreams,

where clouds, like sailors,
      drift in the blue,
    painting shadows
over fields of gold
and copper,
every season a brushstroke 
of time.

I sit in the quiet,
  feeling the weight of the world,
a gentle hand on my shoulder,
where the sun cascades,
  and nature speaks
    in a language of sighs,
telling stories that weave
the fabric of the universe,
  and for a moment,
      I am home.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


Echoes of the Past

in the caves of memory,
       where shadows dance
over walls etched with time,
I find echoes of voices
like leaves blowing
    in an autumn breeze,
whispering secrets
over the rocks,

remnants of laughter,
a symphony lost
    in the passage of ages,
rooted deep in the soil
  that cradles forgotten tales,
where rivers of history
   swirl and churn,

and I walk through their stories,
each step a reminder
    of the beauty
       that cradles existence
in this fleeting life.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


The Call of the Wild

the wild calls—
the mountains shout
to the hearts
that seek the untamed,
dancing on the edge
of the known,
where humanity fades
  and whispers meet the wild.

every gust of wind
tells a tale of freedom,
every rustle in the foliage
    a song of return,
for there lies the soul
      unchained,
mirroring the untamed beats
of the universe.

and here, I stand—
  beneath the forests,
        among the heavens,
and connect with all
        that breathes,
  and like the stars,
lost in the velvet night,
I carry the wilderness
  within me.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


Sunny Skies

the sun spills over
the hills,
draping the earth
    in golden light.
and I stand, fleeting
in this warm embrace,
where shadows lose themselves
      in giggles of grass
and the dance of flowers.

here is joy, unmasked,
each ray a promise
      that lingers,
wrapping me in warmth
of fleeting moments,
  as the wind lifts my heart
    and I remember—

every day
holds the spark of magic
      like fireflies in twilight,
reminding me
that beauty walks
       among the ordinary.

Nature's Lullaby

in the forest of my heart,
a whisper curls
over the still waters,
a balm of tranquility
  rests like a blanket
on the wood and the stone.

the leaves sigh
    beneath the watchful trees,
while the brook
    hums a lullaby,
calling weary souls
      to the cradle of peace,
as the sun dips low,
painting colors of dreams
  along the horizon’s edge.

in every breath,
    find comfort,
in every note
    of this natural symphony,
for we are all part
    of the heartbeat of this earth,
cradled in the arms
      of a timeless embrace.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


The Wilderness Within

take me to the wild,
where the heartbeat of the earth
    resonates within,
a place of unrefined splendor,
a wilderness
echoing the echoes of existence,
shattering the silence
      of the confined.

the tall grasses dance
with the wind’s whispers,
    as the mountains stand
  like ancient sentinels,
echoing the freedom
of souls that soar,
  while the rivers trace
       the story of life
in every drop.

and here, I grasp
   the wilderness within,
      a roar unbound,
a symphony of nature
drawing me back
to the truth of my being,
  where the heart finds home
in the wild embrace
      of existence.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


City Gardens

in the heart of concrete,
a patch of green emerges,
a garden marked with whispers
and the laughter of children,
as blooms erupt,
gifted by the earth’s
       gentle caress.

colors dance
in the hand of a passerby,
each petal a pause,
    a breath of open skies,
the fragrance mingles
with the echo of footsteps,
reminding us
every city blooms
      with feelings,

a symphony of hearts
      tucked in
  between the buildings,
a communion with nature.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


Dancing Shadows

the shadows dance
from the flickering light,
each twist a fleeting moment
      caught in time’s snare,
and I watch
the play unfold,
    the grace of forms
swirling on the walls,
whispering stories
placed softly in flight.

under the glow of night,
the stars hold vigil,
each flicker a spark
      of the universe,
reminding the heart
  of wild dreams,
as the night air wraps
    the world in a soft embrace,
a gentle lullaby of creation,
      where we become
  part of the silence,
a waltz with the cosmos,
  our laughter echoing
       through eternal skies.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


Dreaming of Tomorrow

today fades like the sunset,
    slipping into the embrace
of tomorrow’s promise.
I linger in the twilight,
fingers tracing the outline
of potential,
every star a whisper
  of things yet to bloom,
a reminder that the night
    cradles dreams
       within its folds.

let the wind carry me
to the edges of hope,
where the horizon stretches,
a canvas for the future,
every pulse
a heartbeat of light,
a place where
  I can breathe
into existence,
a serenade of tomorrow,
       woven within.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


The Echoing Forest

the forest speaks
with a thousand tongues,
each leaf a note,
each branch a melody,
every step a heartbeat
      echoing
in the vastness of being.

I wander through shadows,
draped in the stories
of the ancients,
inhaling the whispers
    of sacred earth,
where time dances
  like fireflies in twilight,
your voice, a soft lullaby
cradling the echoes
  of the wildness within.

as night falls,
      the stars awaken,
each one a memory sighing
with the breath of eternity,
the universe expands,
  holding us all
  in its embrace,
and in this stillness,
    I find the wild.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


Whispers of the Wind

the wind carries secrets
each breath a caress,
    as it weaves through
       the familiar trees,
it dances in the leaves,
a chorus of the untold,
each gust a promise
      of freedom,
a reminder
that life is not a line,
       but a tapestry,

woven with threads
of laughter,
    sorrow,
in the rhythm of existence.
I stand beneath the sky,
a canvas splattered
    with light,
where the scent of rain
captures my heart,
and I listen to its song —
a symphony of possibility
  that sets me free.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


Moonlit Dreams

a crescent moon hangs low,
its silvery beams
slipping through the branches
      like whispers of night,
surrounding me
in a shroud of dreams.
I walk on the edge
of shadows,
every step a brush
against the soft glow
of magic unfolding,
as the world breathes
under the softness
     of this celestial light,
where echoes of life
play in the hearts
      of tireless wanderers,
each sigh a beacon to the stars,
reminding me:
  here lies the beauty,
a moment carved
in the vastness of being,
  and I am part of this dance,
a spark of creation,
      shimmering in the night.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


Harmony with Nature

every flutter of a bird,
a note in the summer hymn,
every flower that blooms,
a splash of color on the earth,
we are threads
      in this sacred tapestry,
a mosaic of colors
      spilling into light,
blending with dreams
that drift on the breeze,
     kissing the notes of time.

listen — the earth speaks,
each heartbeat a reminder,
we are children of the universe,
         the pulse of creation rests
in the embrace of the trees,
each whisper of grass,
a promise of rebirth,
    as nature cradles
    us in her arms,
we breathe in the beauty,
        a balm to the weary soul.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


Final Embrace

in the fading light,
I feel the earth’s embrace,
soft as the petals
  that lie cradled
around my feet,
as shadows stretch
    and the moon rises,
every whisper of wind
brings a memory,
      a connection
to the vastness of being,
and I stand,
          humbled
by the beauty of this world.

      nature speaks in silence,
every breath a reminder
    of love’s infinite bond,
and as the stars ignite
   the canvas of the night,
I find my heart,
                    tender and free,
    echoing the rhythm of existence.

In the Tranquil Woods

the woods breathe,
each tree a companion,
as I wander through
     this green maze,
every ray of sunlight
     a gentle nudge
to my soul’s awakening.

I hear the laughter
of unseen creatures,
echoes of life
       hidden among the branches,
and the symphony of leaves
rustling in the embrace
       of the wind’s caress,
a hymn of harmony
floating through the air.

and in this sacred moment,
where time suspends itself,
I become one with the earth,
       a thread woven
in the tapestry of creation,
each heartbeat a declaration
        of existence,
reminding me that we are
    the guardians of this beauty.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


Nature’s Solitude 

in the stillness of the woods,
each breath a gift,
every step a glimpse
   into eternity.
I embrace the solitude,
yet find my heart
   intertwined with the universe,
where branches cradle me,
   and the earth hums
an ancient song,
a melody of belonging,
    of love, of dreams.

the leaves whisper softly,
a lullaby to the weary,
holding me in their secrets,
   as I shed the weight
of a chaotic world,
a gentle surrender
to the unfolding beauty
   of existence.

here, in the quiet,
I discover the depths
   of my being,
where I can dance
    among the echoes,
reveling in the magic
of this wild harmony,
   my spirit unshackled,
   soaring among the stars.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


Roots of Reflection

the roots of the trees
  dig into the earth,
   searching for their stories,
while branches stretch wide,
reaching for the stars,
each leaf a testament
  to the journey taken,
a whisper carried
      through the seasons,
reminding me of time,
    of echoing laughter,
of surrenders and new beginnings.

in this dance of life,
I find my place,
in the gentle embrace
      of the universe,
a patchwork of moments,
stitched together
      by love’s ties,
as I breathe in the fragrances
of the wild,
and with every heartbeat,
I weave my dreams
      through the fabric of existence.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


Chasing Shadows

the shadows chase me,
each step a playful whisper
  on the edge of dusk,
where colors bleed
into the horizon,
a canvas painted
     in warm tones,
each stroke a kiss from the sun,
a farewell to the day...

the trees stand still,
telling tales of the ages,
every branch a witness
to the cycling of time.
  I pause to listen,
      my heart an open vessel,
as the world dances
to the rhythm of nature,
   and beauty unfolds
in the simplest of moments,
          like laughter on the breeze.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


Falling into Dreams

the leaves spiral downward,
a cascade of gold and russet,
every one a dream,
pulsing softly with the flow
of life’s tapestry,
each step I take,
  a connection to the earth,
reminding me of the cycle,
of the moments we lose
as we gather.

the wind lifts my spirit,
a gentle reminder
that we are all
    part of the dance,
a celebration of existence,
where we plummet into dreams,
   falling softly,
   surrendering to the whispers
of the universe,
a symphony that echoes
in the heart of the night.

                                                      - Bob Kaufman


Embrace of the Earth

I drift among the grasses,
every blade a gentle brush
against my skin,
a caress of the earth,
a love letter written
    in the language of the wind,
where flowers speak
     with vibrant colors,
reminding me that life is art,
      painted in the light of dreams.

time slows as I wander,
inhaling the fragrance
of blooming potential,
a dance of possibilities
    unfolding beneath this vast sky,
each moment a heartbeat,
each breath a gift,
   when the soul stirs
to the rhythm of connection,
a sacred bond with nature
      that sings through time.
