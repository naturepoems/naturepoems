The trees are bare, the grass is brown,
The sun's so low, it hardly shines;
Yet still the winter's breath, not frown,
Can kiss the earth; the field aligns.

A white frost cloaks the sleeping land,
The streams now whisper low and clear,
As nature rests at winter’s hand,
And dreams of summer days so near.

In cawing rooks and winter birds,
In hidden nests, that wait for spring,
Lies hope in nature’s whispered words,
Embodied in the joyous wing.

So let us walk these fields with care,
And heed the signs of life around,
For every chill of winter's air
Is but a cloak where springtime's found.

- David Garnett
