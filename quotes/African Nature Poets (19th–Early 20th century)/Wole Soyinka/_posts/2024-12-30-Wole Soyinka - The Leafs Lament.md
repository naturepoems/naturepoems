The Leaf's Lament

Beneath the oak’s broad shade,
I sit, a lone leaf,
Torn in silence, wane and fade,
As the seasons unfurl their grief.
Wind carries me, a quiet sigh,
To seek the solace of the sky.

Oh, to whisper to the stars,
To long for the sun’s warm embrace,
Life’s melody drifts afar,
Yet I still linger in my place,
Cloaked in the softest green,
Yearning for a place unseen.

For as the world spins on,
And my edges start to fray,
I yearn for just one dawn,
To feel the earth’s sweet sway.

— Wole Soyinka
