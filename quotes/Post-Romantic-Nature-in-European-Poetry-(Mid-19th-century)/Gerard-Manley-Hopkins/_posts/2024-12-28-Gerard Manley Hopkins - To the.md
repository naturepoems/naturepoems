To the One

We face the eternal hills, 
    Star-spangled heights, to gaze;  
    The woods grow mystery and grace,  
        Yet we cease to find.
    In haven cold and dark  
        Visiting vanished dream; 
    Ah! the delight is full, and the throb  
    Of high and low; and then  
    We stand to see, and we walk;  
    And forget again why we feel.

                                                        -- Gerard Manley Hopkins, 1885
