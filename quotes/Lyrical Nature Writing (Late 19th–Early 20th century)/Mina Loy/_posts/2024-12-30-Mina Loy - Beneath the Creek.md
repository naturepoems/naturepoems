Look closely at the banks of the creek;
The stories whispered beneath the surface.
I wait to bathe my voice
In the rippling waters,
Tracing every fold and nest,
The brown waters shall coax us!
Join me amongst the wild spears of grass—
Dare to bend and intertwine,
Let us embrace the edges
Where the moss gathers, softer than thought,
And laughter becomes graced
With the kiss of the wind,
Here, we know, we belong
To the ageless dance of creation.

- Mina Loy
