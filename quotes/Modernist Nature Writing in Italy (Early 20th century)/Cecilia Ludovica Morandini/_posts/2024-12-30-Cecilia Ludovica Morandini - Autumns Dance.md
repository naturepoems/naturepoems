Autumn's Dance

Leaves crumble beneath our feet,
a tapestry of gold and bronze,
as the autumn sun kisses the horizon,
its soft glow a farewell to the warmth.
Yet in this decay lies beauty,
a transformation whispered in rustling tones,
a cycle that embraces endings,
a promise wrapped in the chill of the air.

Every gust of wind,
a reminder of the passing,
as trees stand tall, shedding memories,
draped in a gown of fleeting colors,
a moment frozen in the heart of change.

- Cecilia Ludovica Morandini
