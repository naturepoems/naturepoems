The Meadow's Glow

In fields where daisies dance in bliss,  
With sunshine splayed across the ground;  
The laughter of the winds, a kiss,  
In every petal, joy is found.  

The meadow glows with colors bright,  
A waltz of life, a soft embrace;  
In every corner, pure delight,  
Nature’s heart, a sacred space.
