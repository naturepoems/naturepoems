To the hills, and the valleys, and the streams,
To the rocks and the trees, our spirits lie,
In the beauty of Nature, we grope our dreams,
And in her struggle, the minds must tie.

O let us wander through the fragrant wood,
And listen to the winds, sweet-singing free,
And feel within our souls the sylvan flood,
Till life be soothed in Nature’s reverie.


- William Hazlitt
