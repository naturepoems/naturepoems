ANOTHER SONG

In the morning when sweet birds sing
And dew is fresh upon the sea,
Hear the cry of the wanderer’s wing,
O lift your voice and go with me,
In the wilderness of life’s delight.

Come with the dawn, come with the breeze;
While the shadows fade in the day’s first light,
Sing of the river that flows with ease  
And the endless flowers that bend and sway,  
For the world is young and the heart is gay.  


- A E Housman
