Whanganui River

Come listen to the river's song,  
As it glides through the land,  
Its waters a mirror of the sky,  
Kissing the banks, soft and grand.

With every ripple a tale is told,  
Of warriors, love, and pain,  
The heart of the valley flows with life,  
In sunshine, in shadow, in rain.

Oh, Whanganui, you are a friend,  
A comfort in times of strife,  
With your currents deep and your soul so vast,  
You cradle the stories of life.

- P E J M Taylor
