author: Marianne Moore
quote: "The sea is a magazine,
its pages ripple with stories,
as waves turn and toss, 
a cover in soft foam,
words whispered in solitude—
a treasure of tranquility.
Each shell a chapter,
tells of deep, blue wonder."

The sea is a magazine,
its pages ripple with stories,
as waves turn and toss, 
a cover in soft foam,
words whispered in solitude—
a treasure of tranquility.
Each shell a chapter,
tells of deep, blue wonder.

- Marianne Moore
