The whispering of the golden trees
  Carries sweetness in their arms;
Where light arrays the cool cool breeze,
  And love dispels all alarms.

In this Eden, the heart runs free,
  A chorus to every sigh;
We dance beneath the sun-locked lea,
  As the shadows pass to fly.

Oh soft is the way the dusk returns,
  With a gentle sigh in force;
For in the dawn, our spirit yearns,
  To understand its source.


- Alfred Lord Tennyson
