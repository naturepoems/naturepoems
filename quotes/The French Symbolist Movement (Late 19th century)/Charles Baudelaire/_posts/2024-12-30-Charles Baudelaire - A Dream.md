A Dream

O radiant flower beneath the sky,
Wound in dreams that echo eloquently,
The worlds bloom bright for day to dry,
From your summit awaits an endless sea.

With every child of night brought alive,
Your sweet melody unfurls through the night,
Where, embraced by love's art, they thrive,
Resplendent ripples made of tender light.


- Charles Baudelaire
