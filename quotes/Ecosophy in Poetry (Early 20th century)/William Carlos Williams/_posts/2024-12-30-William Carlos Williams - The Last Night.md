The Last Night

The night has a face,

yellow and full

tight on the deadline

swollen with dreams.

Through my door

came an evening

of mourning,

desire yet certain

like autumn grass.

I crossed the room

with whispers and blood,

under the tree

stands the girl

the mother of the sun,

the mother of the night.

Take off your clothes

and walk away.

- William Carlos Williams
