---

The boys are back from the wood, they say,
To the fame and the future and the rest today.
Live long, and grow old, and forget the hours,
Under the sky, among the flowers.

All the pretty things that you hope to find,
Will be waiting for you and your friends in the kind,
Of days that are white as the morning dew,
And the shade that is green with a heart just like you.

Forget not the brothers that passed away,
Who live in the morn of a bright new day.

- A E Housman
