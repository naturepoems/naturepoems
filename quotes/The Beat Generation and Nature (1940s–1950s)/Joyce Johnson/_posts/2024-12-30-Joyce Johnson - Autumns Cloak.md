In autumn’s cloak,
  the trees shed their glory,
          losing colors to the wind,
         a symphony of rust
           and crisp, brittle sounds
as they dance,
     naked and bold against the gray sky.

I walk through the scattered leaves,
    each step a crunch,
        each breath a memory,
    tasting the earthy sweetness
of the season's breath.

- Joyce Johnson
