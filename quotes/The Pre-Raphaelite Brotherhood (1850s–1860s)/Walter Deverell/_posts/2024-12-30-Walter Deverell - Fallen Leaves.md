FALLEN LEAVES

The autumn leaves, in colors warm and bright,  
Do dance like flames before the winter’s grasp,  
In swirling winds, they twirl in merry flight,  
While nature bends to let the season clasp.  
Each leaf that falls, a memory to grasp,  
In hues of amber, gold and crimson bare,  
So fleeting moments come to set their grasp,  
In nature's cycle, life's sweet burdens share.


- Walter Deverell
