The River

The river flows, a silver thread,
Through valleys lush in emerald hue;
By rustic paths, it gently spreads,
A mirror of the sky’s blue view.

It carries tales from heights to low,
A dance of life from shore to shore,
In its embrace, the wild winds blow,
Forever singing, forever more.

- Marjorie Pickthall
