The Stream
Upon the banks where willows weep,

The gentle stream flows forth in leap,

A silver ribbon 'neath the sun,

Where dreams and thoughts in dance are spun.

The ripples laugh in joyous flight,

Reflecting all the world so bright,

In natureâ€™s arms, I feel at ease,

Where time is still, and hearts find peace.

- Richard Jefferies
