Eve in the Garden

In gardens lush, where silence breathes,
The twilight casts its gentle spell,
Amidst the blooms, the soft wind weaves,
A story only time can tell.

With whispers sweet, I lose my way,
Among the petals, dew-kissed light,
Each color sings of love’s decay,
Yet in their beauty, all is bright.

- Marigold Johnson
