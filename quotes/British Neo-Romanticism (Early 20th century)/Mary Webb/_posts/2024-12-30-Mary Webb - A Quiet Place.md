A Quiet Place

There is a quiet place by the river,
Where the rushes dip and the willows sway,
White lilies float on the mirror-like water,
And the sunbeams play when it’s the heat of day.

In this stillness one hears the soft patter
Of a small fleet of water-drops,
Where the dragonflies skim through the twilight,
And the evening murmurs, gently stops.

The cicadas sing of the summer’s glory,
While the leaves exhale as soft as a sigh;
And the breezes tell tales of the old-time stories,
As they weave their way through the dusk earth-dry.


- Mary Webb
