With soft susurrations of dawn's new light,
Each grassy vale grows tender, spread anew;
For every step I take is blessed, bright,
And every scene I touch seems meant for you!

The copper leaves of autumn pass from view,
To summer blooms that bathe the air in dreams;
From written words to endless skies of blue,
Life's heart beats still, as nature ever seems!

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
