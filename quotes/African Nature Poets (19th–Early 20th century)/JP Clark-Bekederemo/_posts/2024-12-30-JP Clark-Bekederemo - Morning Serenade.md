In the stillness of the morning,
When dew kisses the dawn,
A fresh breath of life,
Rises on the horizon.

Birds begin their chorus,
A serenade for the sky,
As blossoms open wide,
And scent the air nearby.

The world is reborn,
In every shade and hue,
Nature sings a hymn,
In the hearts of me and you.

- JP Clark-Bekederemo
