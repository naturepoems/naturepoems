The horizon melted,
the sun kissed the sea,
and in that embrace,
time stopped, freezing
each heartbeat, creating
this moment of wonder
for the eyes to behold.

I reflect on the ocean,
on the waves carving
the sand with smooth fingers,
reminding us how
transient it all is,
how creatures emerge,
how they slip away,
how breath mingles with salt.

May we dance with these tides,
moving between worlds,
learning from the whispers
of nature’s ethereal breath.

- Cecilia Vicuña
