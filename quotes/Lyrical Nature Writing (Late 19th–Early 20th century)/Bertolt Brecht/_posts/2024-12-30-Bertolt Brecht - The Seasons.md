The Seasons

Spring, a tender promise,
akens the earth,
a soft kiss of rebirth,
with each bud unfurling,
a song of hope.

Summer comes, ablaze,
a vibrant laughter,
colors exploding,
breath painted in warmth,
a celebration of life.

Fall recalls the journey,
a mellow whisper,
where each leaf
lets go, transforms,
a reminder of beauty
in the fleeting.

Winter wraps us,
with a shroud of silence,
a time for reflection,
when nature sleeps,
waiting for the return
of the song, the warmth.

So goes the dance of the seasons,
a rhythm of existence,
a call to remember,
that we too are part
of this wondrous cycle.

- Bertolt Brecht
