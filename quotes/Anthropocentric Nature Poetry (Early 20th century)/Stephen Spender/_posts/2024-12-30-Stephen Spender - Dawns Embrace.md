The world shifts lightly at dawn’s first blush,
Kissing flora aglow in the softest hues,
While the dew drips diamond strings,
Silently praising nature’s individual view.

The air thickens with scents of renewed life,
Sparks of sunlight weave through trembling leaves,
Nature exhales softly, opens her pages,
And beneath each layer, the heart must believe.

Hand in hand with the breeze I wander,
Tracing tales held in each season’s breath,
And know as I pause in this garden,
All things blossom anew, beyond death.

- Stephen Spender
