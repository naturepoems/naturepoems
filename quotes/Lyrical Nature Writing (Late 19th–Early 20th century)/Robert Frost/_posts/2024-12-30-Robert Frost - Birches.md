When I see birches bend to left and right
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,
I like to think some boy’s been swinging them.
But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay.

Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
After a rain. They should be pulled that way,
I thought, but I can’t do it; no one can.

I’d like to get away from earth awhile
And then come back to it and begin over.
May no fate willfully misunderstand me
And half grant what I wish and snatch me away

Not to return. Awareness is way too much.
I want to be a little boy again
And swing my birches away from the sun.
I’d rather feel the warmth of a sunbeam
Than know I’m still not free to let it ride.

So let me hold this thought; I want to find
The boy who made those shrieking birches bend
As he swung with full abandon to the ground,
And feel—just feel—those big earth-covered arms
Swaggering over to rescue me from that folly.

- Robert Frost
