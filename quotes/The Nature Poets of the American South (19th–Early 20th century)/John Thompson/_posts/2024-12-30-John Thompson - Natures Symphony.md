Nature's Symphony

In the rustle of leaves,
And the call of the quail,
The world holds a chorus,
In the wind's gentle trail.

With the rain's soft patter,
And the echo of streams,
Nature weaves her magic,
In our hopes and our dreams.

Oh nature, sweet nature,
Your song ever flows,
In the heart of the wild,
In the beauty that grows.

- John Thompson
