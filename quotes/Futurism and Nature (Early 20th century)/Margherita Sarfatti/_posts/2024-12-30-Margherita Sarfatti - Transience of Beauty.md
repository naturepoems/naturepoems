All painted hues of flowers,
blossoming without fear,
transforming the mundane earth,
a canvas of endless possibility,
whirls of color,
as time dances round,
joined by the pulse of the seasons,
a flash of brilliance,
a fleeting moment of joy,
framed in natureâ€™s unending embrace.

- Margherita Sarfatti
