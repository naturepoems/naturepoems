The Desert

Entangled in the wilderness,
Leveled deep in castaway seats,
    The desert brought me to seeds of ache,
For looking lost in sight unmended;
Torn pages by coral and deep,
Where long shadows cloak despair,
Yet hope demands the open sun,
And learn what nature has to bear,
To cross all that beauty deserves.

—Henry David Thoreau
