Midsummer

Somewhere, legends languid in the stones
     Conspire.
The lilac exuding warmth of the fruits,
     Of birds
That break above the golden orchards,
     Once green.

A hot day and the midday question,
I see the river clawing at white roots,
     Shattering:
The twinkliest of its gaze reminds me.
     The lilac
Is shrubbish and frantic in its humour
And crows gaze mockingly with inky eyes,
     Wrapped
Around the grapevine; a breeze curls,
And I giggle and am swept like a circular leaf.

- Derek Walcott
