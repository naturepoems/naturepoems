These are the days when birds come back,
   A very few, a bird or two,
To take a backward look.
   These are the days when skies resume
   The old, old sophistries of June,

   The budded and blossomed families,
   Now ringed with wild lilacs,
And winds begin to whisper low,
   Their tenderness is again with us.

— *The Day’s Fate*

- John Keats
