The Glade

In the glade where sunlight spills,
  And flowers bloom in grace,
A symphony of nature thrills,
  And time begins to chase.

The whispering leaves, a gentle sway,
  The brook sings sweetly on;
In every note, the earth does play,
  Until the day is gone.

The fragrant air, a perfume rare,
  Invites me close to rest;
In nature’s cradle, peace laid bare,
  I’ve found my heart’s true quest.

The shadows stretch, the evening nears,
  A mosaic, rich and bright;
I gather dreams throughout the years,
  Beneath the starry light.

So let me bask in this embrace,
  As day gives way to night;
In every moment, I will trace
  The beauty of the bright.
