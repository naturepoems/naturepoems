Spring
There is a theme of joy in spring,
A promise ringing clear,
Of birds that flit and windows fling
To welcome halcyon year.

O wintry skies, you cannot stay,
Upon the past for long,
This wondrous world so fresh and gay,
Deigns still to do us wrong.

For every bird that flaps its wing,
Each leaf a paler hue,
And every bud that dares to spring
Shall breathe but love anew.

- Christina Rossetti
