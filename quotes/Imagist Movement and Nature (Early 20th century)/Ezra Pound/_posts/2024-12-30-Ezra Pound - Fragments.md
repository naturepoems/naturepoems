Fragments
Leave the shadows behind, divide the waters,
Into the paths of flowers through the grey of the moor.
Let us reach across the tempo of murmuring echoes—
For lo! The knight fell line by line.
Soon his fate crossed with a distant tree,
Drawing upon our years hidden beneath.
The owl, the eater of good things within,
Was pulling at last—captured beauty spilled.
Oh singers with cleansed voices,
Rise up through the awakening shadows,
And clap your gentle hands, free with me,
Through leaves and stones once sprung from earth!

- Ezra Pound
