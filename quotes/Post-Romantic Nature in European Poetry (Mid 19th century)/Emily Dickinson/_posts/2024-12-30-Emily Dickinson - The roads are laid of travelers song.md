The roads are laid of travelers’ song,  
That danced upon their feet –  
And Nature took the prize she sought  
Through every Joy so sweet –  

I walked along the sunny path,  
Where flowers bloomed so fair —  
With every breath, I grasped the air  
That filled my heart with care –  

Such joy awaits in every lane  
Where Nature's treasures peek –  
And hearts find solace in the dream  
Where life offers us a peak –

- Emily Dickinson
