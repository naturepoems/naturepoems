When evening paints the sky with gold,
And shadows stretch so long,
The echoes of the day unfold,
In nature’s love song strong.

With every breath of twilight air,
A melody anew,
Whispers of dreams that serenely share,
The promise of a view.

So linger here, in this gentle pause,
And let the night enfold;
For in the beauty of the cause,
Lies treasures yet untold.

- David Garnett
