Fergus and the Druid

You shall go, whether or not,
As the river flows and the mist ensues,
And the stars bring light, my dear,
You shall go by the path you choose.

But under the bending sycamores,
Where the shadows in the breeze rise,
I will find you there at dusk,
Beneath the folds of star-strewn skies.

- William Butler Yeats
