The Garden's Gift

In every bloom, a story speaks,
Of sunlit days and gentle rains,
Where nature's hand, with tender creeks,
Revives the soul, and joy remains.

The petals dance in softest hue,
While bees hum songs of sweet delight,
In this embrace, the heart is true,
Among the colors, bold and bright.

Each seed a promise, deep in earth,
Awaits the warmth of love and care,
In every leaf, there lies rebirth,
A testament to what we share.

So let me tend my sacred space,
With gratitude for life's own grace,
In every garden, love will trace,
The beauty found in nature's face.

- Aspazija Ella Zitere
