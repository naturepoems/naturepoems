The Smoke Tree
To the smoke tree that stands all alone,
And drapes a mist of gray in sun,
I came to make a world a home
And leave for others when I’m gone.

Leave them gray, narrow, and slow,
And take a harvest that seems fair
And to unwind from below here’s show,
An out-loud smoke that lingers there.

But stand brings no better wish
Than other to loiter safe in sky
Like some soul can wind its bliss
And over who has lost a sigh.

- Robert Frost
