The winter's chill, a crisp delight,
Blankets the earth in purest white.
In nature's calm, the stars ignite,
A world transformed by silent night.

Where every branch and frozen glade,
Awakens dreams that winter made.
In nature's hold, no fear, no shade,
A tranquil peace that won't soon fade.

- Sigrid Unset
