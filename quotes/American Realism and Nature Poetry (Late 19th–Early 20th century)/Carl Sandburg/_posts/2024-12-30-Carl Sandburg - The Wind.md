The Wind

The wind stirs the leaves,
The clouds move faster, the shadows
Plunge the grass into darkness.
O, the violent dance of the rain!—
The cold taps the soil,
And the flowers bow and shift,
In this tug of sky and earth,
A sudden sound flows from the season,
And the trees twist and curl at the beckoning—
Here is a storm inviting change,
The cycle of life beckoning anew.

- Carl Sandburg
