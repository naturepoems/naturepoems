Helen

All Greece hates
The still eyes in the white face,
The lust of the blood
And the pain of the soul, 
The settlement of the face,
The death of flesh, 
Loved to the point of ruin.

How could you wear
A mask of beauty,
How could I thy
Cry of farewell,
Yet still your value
Is in the roots of pain
That plants around our grief.

Rise, Helen, rise! 
Rise with the lilies
And the trees that hold your name.

You are not alone, 
O timeless grace, 
There is no fate
In the bitter tides of life.
