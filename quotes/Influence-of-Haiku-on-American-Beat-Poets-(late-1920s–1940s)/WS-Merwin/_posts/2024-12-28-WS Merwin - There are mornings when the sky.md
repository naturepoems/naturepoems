author: WS Merwin
quote: "There are mornings when the sky lowers,
Blends with distant hills into mist,
And the woods turn to sapphire, quiet,
Muffled in soft layers of fog.
The air, filled with the breath of life,
Catches your heart in its stillness, and pulls you, reluctant.
For the wild mountains do not hide, but show
The secrets of their slopes in translucent embrace."

There are mornings when the sky lowers,
Blends with distant hills into mist,
And the woods turn to sapphire, quiet,
Muffled in soft layers of fog.
The air, filled with the breath of life,
Catches your heart in its stillness, and pulls you, reluctant.
For the wild mountains do not hide, but show
The secrets of their slopes in translucent embrace.
