In twilight's soft embrace we find,
The peace that natureâ€™s gifts bestow,
With every star that shines above,
A promise of tomorrow's glow.

The moon reflects on tranquil lakes,
A mirror of the world below,
In this symphony of night, we drift,
With dreams where only wild things grow.

- Margaret Atkinson
