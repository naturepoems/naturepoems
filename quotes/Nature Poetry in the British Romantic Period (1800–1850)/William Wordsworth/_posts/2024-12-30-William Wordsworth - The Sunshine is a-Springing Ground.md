The sunshine is a-springing ground,
From lands where faerie waters flow;
Upon the stone and misty mound,
Where wakeful winter winds do blow.

So golden are the daisies wild,
I see them shine without a qualm;
The bells of summer ring me mild,
And softly weave the twilight's balm.

Through every leaf and creeping flame,
Art thou the power that wakes in me;
A world so real is not the same,
Forever in your face, I see.

- William Wordsworth
