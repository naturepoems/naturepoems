Thou art indeed just, Lord

Thou art indeed just, Lord, if I contend  
  With thee;  
But I complain and run not thee very wrong.

As I've lived shall come to an end,  
But hear me, in this state  
Of beauty  
When garden swings and sitts  
At the face of thy morn:  
I sit here hallowed, unaware.

Only meant, thy sheer mercy,  
Can I lie—the shadows and wave of the fall  
Goes my breath,  
And fair of the seed saw.  

There is no matter/ confusion,  
Crying and reviving me—  
The shore of dusk, the peace of stars  
And who I have grown vainly and wearied of.


- Gerard Manley Hopkins
