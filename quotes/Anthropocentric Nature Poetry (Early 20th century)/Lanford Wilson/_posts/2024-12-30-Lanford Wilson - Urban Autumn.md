Amidst the chatter of the city,  
there lies a park ablaze  
with the hues of autumn.  
Leaves tumble, painted in shades  
of fire and gold,  
each step a crunch,  
a reminder that change is  
the only constant.  
The trees stand tall,  
their branches bare yet wise,  
sheltering the moments  
of laughter, of stillness,  
in the heart of the urban rush.  
Here, the silence breathes,  
a canvas of serenity  
preserved in the arms of nature;  
a space where souls reconnect.
