Nature is the master-piece in art;
In which the heart of man has an interest profound,
Yet oftentimes skips from the outer to the inner,
Where the soul seeks the subtlety of her sound.

A mountain piled with hope and love and light,
Draped in a mist, that brightens to a cloud,
Gives birth to valleys where flowers oft riot,
And tails of berries hang in the light aloud.
