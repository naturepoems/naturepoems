In the Night

The tree stands still,
but winds rip
through the fragile branches
like a lover's song.
Feel the stars grasping,
amid colors blooming
among dark folds
where everything unveils the night,
a night so soft,
it presses against the mind. 

Let speech shatter into sparks,
for little leads us into light,
we were meant for quietude,
and secret gazes hidden,
with heaven-born wonder. 



- Rainer Maria Rilke
