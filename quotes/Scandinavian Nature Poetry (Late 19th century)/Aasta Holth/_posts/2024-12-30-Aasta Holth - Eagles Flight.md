Eagle’s Flight
High above the rugged peaks,
Where the air is crisp and clear,
An eagle soars, its spirit speaks,
Wings wide like dreams of the sincere.

Through the skies, it glides with grace,
Master of the vast expanse,
In the stillness, nature’s face,
Holds us captive in a trance.

- Aasta Holth
