---

And now I see the world as beauty’s head;
I hear the forest in sweet angry breaks 
Where blue waves blink off brookless bread,  
Each gathered fern howe’er she awakes.

And here the heart of the earth clear grows,
Food for each creature, and each branch does shed—
Thus rules the bee return above the blossom
Nor yet does nature bleed from any bed,  

Within silent harvests: to these shall offer
Only terrible beauty. And beauty shall rise again.
Wherever beauty’s head lies laid down soft,
And still be chased by all of hope and need.
*From "Song of the Lyre"*

- John Keats
