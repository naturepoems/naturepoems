The morning sun doth rise anew,  
In the arms of nature’s hue.  
Every blossom speaks of grace,  
In the light’s warm embrace.  
O how sweet is morning air,  
In the moments both rare and fair!

With each shadow cast to frame,  
All is whispering your name;  
In the meadow, sweetly tread,  
As my heart is gently led.

- Sir Philip Sidney
