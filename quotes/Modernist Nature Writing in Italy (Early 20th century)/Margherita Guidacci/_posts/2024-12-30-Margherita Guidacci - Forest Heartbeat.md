The forest holds its peace,
a canvas of shadows and light,
every leaf a word,
every path a choice,
a world woven in silence.

Within, I hear the heartbeat of earth,
a resonance of life pulsing
through the deepest roots,
knowing that even in stillness,
everything is alive,
everything is changing.


- Margherita Guidacci
