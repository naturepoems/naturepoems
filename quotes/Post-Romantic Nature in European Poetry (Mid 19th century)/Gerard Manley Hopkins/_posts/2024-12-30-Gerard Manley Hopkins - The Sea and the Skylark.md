The Sea and the Skylark

As a green groom, taking a starry flight
  On the cobbled sea; the ship from the shore,
  Of the sprinkled waters, laugh with and delight
  To stare at the murmur of the beach, in the roar.

The sea is the sea and the skylark sings,
  On the wings of the eagle, over the lands,
  While the waters, the world, blest by oasis, brings
  The sudden shock of grace in the sands.

A blissful bird on steep, grey banks tonight,  
  When night steeds come, draw love’s caresses,  
  And drift, and draw in assignments’ light.


- Gerard Manley Hopkins
