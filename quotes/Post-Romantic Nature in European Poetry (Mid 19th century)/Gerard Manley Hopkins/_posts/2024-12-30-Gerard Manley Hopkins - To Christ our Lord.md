To Christ our Lord

The Kestrel's chime  who call to me,  
  High roads longing and glory of fire;
  Who triumphs past the far-off car,  
  Like ranks of gleams on the rabbit’s coils.

Nature, where full-time I’m sitting  
  Drive, et fruit of the harvest; divine fright  
  They come of the curl, of stars in their light  
  Like the willow-draught; soft, and who scarce rise!

In the cities above arise;  
  How far should they honor;  
  Where once they would rise across dells;  
  But the lights of day keep from them by divide!


- Gerard Manley Hopkins
