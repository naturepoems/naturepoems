Stars

Parting the shrouds of darkness,
You scatter your brilliance,
Among the shadows of all the moving air.
In the quiet hour,
As the lilies sleep,
The soft winds brush across the sky.

Moonlight gives you the veil of beauty,
So many gossamer threads,
Weaving a web, so tender in your grace.
Nurtured below, the budding leaves
Awake—with anticipation.

— H.D. (Hilda Doolittle)
