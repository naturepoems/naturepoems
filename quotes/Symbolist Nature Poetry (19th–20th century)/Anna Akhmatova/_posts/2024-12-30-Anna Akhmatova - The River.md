The River

The river flows with silent grace,
A ribbon of reflections bright,
It tells the tales of days gone by,
In rippling waves that catch the light.

Each turn and bend, a journey shared,
Of laughter, love, and longing deep,
In its embrace, I find my peace,
And let the waters soothe my sleep.


- Anna Akhmatova
