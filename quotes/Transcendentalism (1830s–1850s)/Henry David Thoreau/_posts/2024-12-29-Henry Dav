To stand upon a hill, the sky above ablaze,
And measure with sacred shouts
      Over waters or welcome me a friend;
Lift my head into the moments,
A share of beauty as seen!

I’ll hear with the day’s call,
And possess all things here, dear sharpness of dawn;
With floating thoughts, let the earth hold its thrill,
That which brings sense to purple flowers,
      And here’s my heart—awake!

This joy shall twinkling dine,
And feel silence lying, as if at dusk,
Like the soft stirring bells of music, where
I walk!

Grace all give their wishes to me, and
      Rays of a forward heart,!
Where old and young flow eternal days;

- Henry David Thoreau
