Sweet is the song of evening calm,
As nature weaves her gentle psalm;
The stars emerge with bright allure,
In every heart, a longing cure.
By rivers deep and meadows wide,
With every moment, hope and pride;
The night reveals what day concealed,
In natureâ€™s light, our spirits healed.

- Robert Southwell
