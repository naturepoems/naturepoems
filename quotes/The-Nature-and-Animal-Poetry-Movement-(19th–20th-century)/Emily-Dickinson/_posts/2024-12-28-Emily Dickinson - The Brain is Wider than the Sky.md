The Brain is Wider than the Sky —
For — put them side by side —
The one the other will include —
With ease — and you — beside —

The Brain is deeper than the sea —
For — hold them — Blue to Blue —
The one the other will absorb —
As sponges — Buckets — do —

The Brain is just the weight of God —
For — heft them — Pound for Pound —
And they will differ — if they do —
As syllable from Sound —

- Emily Dickinson
