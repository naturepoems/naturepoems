Before me stretches, vivid, Nature’s breast;
A clamorous chorus wakes the slumbering hours,
Dew-kissed and silken, each blade's a diamond dressed,
Where sunbeams lace the blossoms into flowers.

A fitful wind that strokes the willow's hair,
Embraced by foliage, sill-like shadows cast,
The brooks unburden dreams of sweet despair,
In ripples that across the meadows thrust, vast.

Lone sylvan rings that bite the budding day,
Feel frail, bespoken like an ancient road,
Where songs of earth in melodic disarray,
Guide me through life, a transient ode bestowed.

- John Clare
