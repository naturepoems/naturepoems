Whispers of journeys across the trails, 
Each sunset a promise, each dawn a new chance, 
In the dance of the seasons, life finds its romance."

The horizon stretches, clouds like sails, 
Whispers of journeys across the trails, 
Each sunset a promise, each dawn a new chance, 
In the dance of the seasons, life finds its romance.
