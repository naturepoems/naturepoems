The Earth laughs in flowers;
To see her. 
— 

Look upon the earth,
How she is clad;

With color and beauty,
So glad and so free;

A map of the regions
Her bounty can give,

And every flower,
The song of her lyre.

Good people, take heed—
Well she brings forth,

And softening the wild,
She rolls ’neath our toes.

Walk on her paths,
Breathe in her breath,

For wisdom she whispers
In every green leaf,

While beauty springs forth,
In the form of the flower,

The earth laughs in flowers,
And we listen with love.
