The Wind and the Rain
The wind blew to the freshly mown fields  
And I looked out into the deep and dark  
I felt it gust against the tops of my brows;  
Upon the hills stood high above our blood,  
And noted all our care beneath the trees,  
While shadows traveled deeper into the stars  
And were stained still in their light.  

The rain poured over pastures and big, and dark  
Left streaks of green upon the furrows of the earth;  
The winds wept for all the dreams I held  
Yet evening lingered softly near the leaves  
That were in their shape, both pure and dark;  
And yet my heart had felt the wind against the cries  
Of towering back within waiting night where I would be whole.  

The wind would speak  
Of the people left within the dream,  
Like darkness listed nearly for the light  
And I should fear to face it all alone;  
Each coming storm has lifted every heart  
And draws it deep where we are all together fled,  
Yet it was like the starless night I played  
And there was no man lost under this stone.  

The rain moved with heavier grace  
Into the shapes of unexpected gloom;  
There were songs and clamor, and the noise forgot;  
Many men still stood beneath the coming dawn  
Yet shadows vanished out of sight beyond  
Dreams eternal as the glories hide when  
Morn and evening sigh around the wind together.  

The stillness falls on far away to night.  
To vanish patiently beyond each clasp of dreams;  
Remembering now the brightness that lost sight,  
When manners of the woods could hide away  
Into the folds of silence I had come around.

Through the wear of shadows finding breath alone  
Among these ripe and shadowy lights at dawn,  
Womanly stillness spilled away my route  
And held me as if they were still noon,  
A voice unnoticed spoke them soft and deep,  
Listen; the wind will start the rain as soon as dawn.
