**I Am Vertical**  
   
   I am vertical.  
   No longer will the sky  
   Curve in complete silence.  
   Or the earth pull and weep.  
      
   In secret -  
   Clouds move,  
   Touching the feet of trees,  
   As life whispers—  
   I break light as spring  
   Opens around me,  
   A world of howling colors  
   Built on fading time.  
   I am vertical -  
   And will speak with strength to existence.

- Sylvia Plath
