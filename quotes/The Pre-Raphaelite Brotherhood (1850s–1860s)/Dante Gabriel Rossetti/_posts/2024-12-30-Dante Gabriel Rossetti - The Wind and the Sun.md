The Wind and the Sun

The wind and the sun, with a deep sway,
  to speak upon paths belong here to ask,
  wake with wonders, soft as infant’s play,
  to kiss each spirit, here hath immense task.

Which perhaps leads to get here emboldened clay,
  while flowers star the world of tender dreams.
  A simple air doth whisper slow, profound,
  as leaves awake, caught 'neath heavens beams.

With glistening tints upon the windswept lair,
  in bloom which carves about with laughter’s breath,
  they sculpt here softly, woven by true care.
  For daffodils hath answers carved ‘till death;

Yet spring goes up, at night it is brought low,
  give not your wishes heart, to seek above, 
  between winds of time sweet dreams do flow,
  where recollections bloom with such deep love.


- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
