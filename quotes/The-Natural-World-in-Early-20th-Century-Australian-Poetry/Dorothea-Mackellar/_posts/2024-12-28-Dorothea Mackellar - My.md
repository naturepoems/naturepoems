My Country
The love of field and coppice,
Of green and shaded lanes,
Of ordered woods and gardens
Is running in my veins;

Birds’ soft pastures of the sky
Are call of the willows’ round,
And all the hills and plains
Lose their beauty when the rain
Falls back to the ground.

I’m not in the mood for ballads,
And I should never forsake
The beauty of the bushland,
Or the lyrebird that creates
Her serenading sound.

This is my homeland, my country,
Where the summer sun is bright.
I’ll sing of the rich wildflowers
And the blue sky’s glory light.

For the wind and the rain
Are both music, they refrain,
And the rivers that wander,
Should sing of my dear land,
In every heart they can gain.

- Dorothea Mackellar
