A meadow breathes in the glow of the morn,
Butterflies flutter, and daisies sway,
In the warmth of the sun, all worry is torn,
Nature unfolds with the dawning of day.

Each petal is woven with dew's gentle grace,
The fragrance of earth is a sweet perfume,
As life reawakens in this cherished space,
The beauty of nature continues to bloom.

- Andrejs Panteļeevs
