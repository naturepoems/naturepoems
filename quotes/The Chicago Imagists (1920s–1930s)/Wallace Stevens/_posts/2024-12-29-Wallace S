Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction

The poem of the mind in the act of finding
What will suffice it, has not found it.
The poem of the mind in the act of finding
What will suffice it, has not found it.

In a kind of beauty of this matter,
The sun is a comfort, a bird that flies
In the blue gentleness, a trigger of seasons; The seasons directions,
The target of the heart's breath, held tight, and
Near and bright in nature's rough of weather.

But what is our position between, born amidst
The sounds of darkness formed beyond,
What shall we do with this world of boundaries,
Of the winters and the birthdays? All cries lead to an answer,
The answer is true, and begetting what does suffice—
The loves that make us known, that crown.
At last we know what we are: the sparrow's flight beneath
The town's wide eye, and every peculiar tree.

- Wallace Stevens
