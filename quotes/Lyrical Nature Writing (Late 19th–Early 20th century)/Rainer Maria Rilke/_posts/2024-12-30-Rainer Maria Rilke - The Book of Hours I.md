The Book of Hours, I

I want to be with those who know secret things
    or else alone.
    I want to be with those who know the secrets of the sea,
    who have seen beautiful creatures in the foam,
    and know the bright stars of the night.

    O love, do not let me be content this day
    or the months. Keep appearing every day,
    or let me leave and search.

—Rainer Maria Rilke
