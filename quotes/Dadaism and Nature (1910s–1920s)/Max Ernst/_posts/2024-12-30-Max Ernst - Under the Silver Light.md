Under the silver light,
    I walked through thoughts,
  deep fields of unknowing,
        where flowers dream.

   Just as time forgot,
      the passage of hearts,
        the evening bloomed,
   soft, gentle, and surreal,
   whispering in the twilight's grasp.

       Nature, a painter, brushes with stars.

- Max Ernst
