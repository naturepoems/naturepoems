The Idea of Order at Key West
She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind
Of man or of the trees or of the clouds.

But she sang, drowning out the sea,
And the wind filled her soul with clouds.
She sang that the world would form again
As the wind blows, and the ocean rolls.

A woman is more than a painting made of different colors â€”
More than a nurtured heart of reality with eyes 
To see beyond body; in stillness, and growing still.
To sing and form again, as the wind blows the sea
Into a sudden order where its being is rendered.

- Wallace Stevens
