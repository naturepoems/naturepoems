author: Robert Duncan
quote: "In the late summer hush of the evening air,
The trees lean out of the darkening green,
As the light from the setting sun spills gold into the land.
Everything is breathing, so full of secrets,
The whisper of leaves turning green to gold,
The shadow of clouds sweeping soft.
Here in this moment, the world rests,
And I am found in the stillness of nature's breath."

In the late summer hush of the evening air,
The trees lean out of the darkening green,
As the light from the setting sun spills gold into the land.
Everything is breathing, so full of secrets,
The whisper of leaves turning green to gold,
The shadow of clouds sweeping soft.
Here in this moment, the world rests,
And I am found in the stillness of nature's breath.
