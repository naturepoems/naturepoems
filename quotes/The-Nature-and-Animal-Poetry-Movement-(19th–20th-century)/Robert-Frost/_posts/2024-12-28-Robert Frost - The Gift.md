The Gift Outright
The land was ours before we were the land's.
She was our land more than a hundred years
Before we were her people.

It was she who brought us, by the hand,
To overthrow in a civil way
Here in the sense of grace, we found our place,
A land owned by soft wisdom.

We loved the land, but we knew it not;
Our feet fell into its arms again and again.
So let us dance beneath the holding star,
In peace to hold the beauty evermore.

For in the simples of this wild earth,
We know that beauty lives forever,
And that is worth any cost we find,
To feel the sun bring love in every turn.

This land became a soil in us,
And so we breathe in earth and truth alike,
In harmony of spirit, of our love!

- Robert Frost
