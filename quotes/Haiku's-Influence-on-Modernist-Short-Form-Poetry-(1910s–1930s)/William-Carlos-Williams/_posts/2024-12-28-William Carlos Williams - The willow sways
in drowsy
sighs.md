in drowsy
sighs"

author: William Carlos Williams
quote: "The willow sways
in drowsy
sighs, painting
shadows on a path
dusted by lost
footsteps. A trickle
of sunlight finds its way.

Orchid perfume breathes,
dissolving the day.
The stillness brings a smile."

The willow sways
in drowsy
sighs, painting
shadows on a path
dusted by lost
footsteps. A trickle
of sunlight finds its way.

Orchid perfume breathes,
dissolving the day.
The stillness brings a smile.
