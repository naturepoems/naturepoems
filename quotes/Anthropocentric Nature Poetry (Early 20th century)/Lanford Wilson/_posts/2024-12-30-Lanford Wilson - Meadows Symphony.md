In a meadow painted with sunlight,  
where the wildflowers sway,  
a tapestry woven in gold and hue,  
each petal a promise,  
each stem a hope.  
Butterflies flit on gentle wings  
as the breeze carries laughter,  
a symphony of life rising  
in the warmth of the day.  
A place to lay your burdens down,  
a sanctuary for the soul,  
the soft ground yielding secrets  
of the earth, whispering tales  
of growth, of flourishing  
in harmony with the sun.

- Lanford Wilson
