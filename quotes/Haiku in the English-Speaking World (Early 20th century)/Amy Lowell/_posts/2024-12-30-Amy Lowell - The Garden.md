The Garden

Hush!  You will wake the lilies.  
They are deep in their dreams  
With their petal palms turned upward  
And their lovely faces turned to the sky.

They do not want to be disturbed  
On this bright afternoon.
This is the day they set the seeds  
And the wind sows the pollenâ€”they will  
Awake in their own time,  
And rise into the glory of life,  
And become the back-bone of this garden
Where the dew gathers like tears.

- Amy Lowell
