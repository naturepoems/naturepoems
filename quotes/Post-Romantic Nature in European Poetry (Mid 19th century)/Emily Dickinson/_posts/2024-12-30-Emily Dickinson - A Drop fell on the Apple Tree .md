A Drop fell on the Apple Tree –  
Another on the Roof –  
A Half a dozen kissed the Eaves,  
And made the Gables laugh –  

A few went out to help the Brook  
That went to sleep – at Noon –  
The rest with their superior Grace,  
Fell on the Forest – Noon –  

The Tempest at the Gate –  
Is just a tolling bell –  
And every droplet keeps the time  
In Nature's sweet farewell –

- Emily Dickinson
