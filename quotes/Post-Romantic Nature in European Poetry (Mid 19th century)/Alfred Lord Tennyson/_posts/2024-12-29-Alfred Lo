A Farewell

Be brave, my soul, and sing thy song,
  In forests dark and shadows deep,
For in their leaves there waits a throng
  To heal thy heart, and bring thee sleep.

Let silence echo forth its light,
  And whisper every secret thought,
While every breeze shall take its flight,
  For in the heart of dreams we're caught.

So farewell to the world's cold pain,
  With nature's hands I'll find the shade,
No longer lost, nor torn in vain,
  In nature's arms, to hearts conveyed.

- Alfred Lord Tennyson
