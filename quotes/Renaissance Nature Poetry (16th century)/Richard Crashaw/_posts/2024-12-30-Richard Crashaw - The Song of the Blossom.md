The Song of the Blossom  
A flower, a flower, bright in the sun,  
Rich in thâ€™Embroidery of nature's delight;  
Each petal bright, a sparkling run,  
In the rich tapestry of morning light.

What sorrows have I known, what burdens borne,  
The wind doth murmur low and soft beside me,  
Yet here, beneath the sky, reborn,  
I dance, I sway, I hum blissfully.

The ruby hue, the sapphire blue,  
Colors mingle, mixing sweet and sound,  
In this graceful mission, I bid adieu,  
To all things lost, to the earthly ground.

Rejoice, oh heart, in this fleeting time,  
For in my scent, your grief will melt away;  
Embrace the morn, the sunshine, the rhyme,  
For life returns, in splendid display.

- Richard Crashaw
