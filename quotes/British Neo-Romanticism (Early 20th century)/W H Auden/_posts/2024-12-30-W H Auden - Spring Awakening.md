The springtime blooms with colors bright,
As petals dance in warm sunlight;
Each flower holds a promise true,
Of life renewed and skies of blue.

In every breeze, the fragrance stirs,
A testament to nature's purrs;
A world alive with joy and grace,
Where every heart can find its place.


- W H Auden
