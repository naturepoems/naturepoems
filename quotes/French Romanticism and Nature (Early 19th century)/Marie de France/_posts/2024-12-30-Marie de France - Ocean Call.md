The ocean calls with waves of blue,
An endless dance, a rhythmic song.
With tides that rise and fall anew,
In nature’s arms, we all belong.

The salty air fills up our lungs,
As gulls dive down and laughter flows.
In harmony, the world has sung,
Where the ocean and heart’s desire glows.

- Marie de France
