To Those Who Live in the Mountain.
 \nBecause I would find out from you.
You who listen to the call
of the birds in the wild,
who fold your arms calmly
against the power and heat
of this radiant sun.
Will you come among our ways,
this flickering beam of heat,
all clear and bold?
Return, however sweet and tender,
freely set out so many spiritual elements:
so unaided be all who live
with rocks, roots, and transfixed in gestures
of daily love, remaining free,
we will beg this earth to repair,
sow seeds and doves ashore,
below the dawn sky.”  ,
