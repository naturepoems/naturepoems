The Call of the Wild
In forest deep where shadows play,
The wild calls forth both night and day,
A symphony of bird and beast,
Where silent hearts find solace, peace.

Among the roots and fragrant pine,
Life whispers secrets, ancient line,
And as we wander, breath in air,
In nature's arms, we shed our care.

- Mieczysław Wojnicz
