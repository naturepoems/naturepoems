My long-sought aim is now at hand.
To touch the earth, a name, a sand.
And in the depth of every field,
Where life is claimed, is well-revealed.

The seasons move, a gentle tide,
Each dawn awakes with open wide,
For every flower blooms anew,
It's life and death, and death anew.

In every rock a tale it tells,
In every brook a silence dwells.
Together form the world in hand,
Release the weight, the home, the land.

- Robert Frost
