A green and lively woods at fall clamor,
Leaves wear orange-brown like crowns divine.
The breeze whispers tales through every channel,
Voices lost in the wood, as sun and shadow aligns.

The dance of light across the tulip's glow
As children sing amongst the trembling leaves,
The heart rejoices in endless echo’s flow—
Roots entwined in the meadow, all life believes.

Once awash with laughter’s sweet embrace,
Together we gathered each dropping sun-kiss,
To remember—a moment will fade from grace,
Yet the memories burn bright in twilight's bliss.

- Robert Frost
