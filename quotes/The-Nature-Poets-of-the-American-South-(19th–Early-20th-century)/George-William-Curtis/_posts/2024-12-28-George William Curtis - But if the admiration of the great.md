But if the admiration of the great works of nature
Born in our own country and out of ourselves,
Begets the affection of our own heart of humanity,
Let us hail an evergreen in our own dominion;

For the frugal acorn spreading its mighty arms,
And in the lapses created by industrious hands,
If our hearts become noble, and our eyes shine,
Then Heaven’s blue sky is the reward of a soul planted in the hills.

- George William Curtis
