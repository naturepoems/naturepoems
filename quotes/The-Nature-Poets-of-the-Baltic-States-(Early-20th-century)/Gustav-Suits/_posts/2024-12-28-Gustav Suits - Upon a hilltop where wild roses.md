Upon a hilltop where wild roses grow,
a whispering breeze breathes the tales of the slow.
The essence of earth mingles soft with the glow,
as we wander through time, as the rivers flow.

Mountains stand stoic, with crowns draped in mist,
while valleys embrace in a soft, tender tryst.
A realm undisturbed, where silence believes,
at the heart of it all, the soul, it retrieves.


- Gustav Suits
