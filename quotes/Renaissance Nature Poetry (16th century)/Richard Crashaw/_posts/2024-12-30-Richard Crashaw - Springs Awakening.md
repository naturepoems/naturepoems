Spring's Awakening  
When winter’s shroud does melt away,  
And green returns to barren land,  
In whispered breeze, the dawn of day,  
Unfolds the life we understand.

The crocus blooms in violet grace,  
While daisies wake from sleep anew,  
With every scent—a strong embrace,  
The sun spins gold in morning dew.

In every petal, hope reborn,  
In every blade, a world unites,  
As children chase the sound of morn,  
And nature glows in pure delights.

This time of growth speaks soft and clear,  
Each moment cherished, held so tight,  
For in this dance, we find our sphere,  
And celebrate the day’s delight.

- Richard Crashaw
