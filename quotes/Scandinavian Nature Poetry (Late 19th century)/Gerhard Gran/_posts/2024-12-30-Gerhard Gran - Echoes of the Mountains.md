The mountains rise, majestic, bold,
Their peaks adorned with snow so bright,
In valleys deep, the tales are told,
Of nature's timeless, silent might.

Through winds that howl and storms that roar,
Life flourishes, fierce and true,
In every crevice, every shore,
A testament to nature's view.

- Gerhard Gran
