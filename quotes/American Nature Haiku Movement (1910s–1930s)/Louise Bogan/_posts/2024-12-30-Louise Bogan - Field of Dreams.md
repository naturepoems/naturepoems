A field of wildflowers sways,
Beneath a sky of endless blue,
Nature's palette in full bloom—
Coloring the air with joy,
While the sun shines bright,
And whispers of summer sing.

Each petal a promise,
Each blossom a prayer—
In this vast expanse of green,
The heart beats freely,
In rhythm with the earth’s laughter.
