The Pond
In a quiet pond, where lilies sway,  
Reflections of the sky blend in shades of gray;  
A dragonfly flutters, with iridescent wing,  
While frogs croak a tune that the warm sun does sing.  
Here, whispers of the willows softly weep,  
As shadows of clouds drift and glide so deep.  
The breeze rustles gently, stirring each leaf,  
In this tranquil place, my heart finds relief.  
Waves lap at the shore, a rhythm divine,  
While time ebbs away, in peace I entwine.  
O Nature's embrace, my soul is set free,  
In this pond of wonders, I long to be!
