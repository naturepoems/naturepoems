**The Gentle Stream**  
In quiet banks where waters glide,  
The gentle stream flows side by side;  
With murmurs soft and laughter clear,  
It sings a tune for all who hear.  
Its silver dance, a breath of air,  
Reflects the sky, so rich and fair;  
In every bend, a story spun,  
Of nature's joy, forever won.

- Hannah More
