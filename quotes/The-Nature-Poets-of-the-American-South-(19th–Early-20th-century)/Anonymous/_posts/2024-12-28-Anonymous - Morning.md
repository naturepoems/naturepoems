Morning Dew

The morning breaks with gentle light,  
When dew-kissed petals greet the sun;  
Each drop a gem, so pure and bright,  
Whispers of night, now come undone.  

The world awakens, fresh and new,  
With every sigh of silver mist;  
A canvas painted, green and blue,  
Life’s tender moments, not to be missed.
