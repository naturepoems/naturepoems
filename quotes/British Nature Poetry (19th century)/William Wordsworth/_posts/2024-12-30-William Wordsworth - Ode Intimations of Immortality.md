There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
The earth, and every common sight,
To me did seem
Apparelled in celestial light,

The glory and the freshness of a dream.
It is not now as it hath been of yore;
Turn wheresoe'er I may,
By night or day,
The things which I have seen I now can see no more.

The rainbow comes and goes,
And lovely is the rose;
The moon doth with delight,
Look round her when the heavens are bare;

Waters on a starry night,
Are beautiful from everywhere;
I see them now with a solemn stare.

The streaks of morning light
Are not the ones that seem to speak,
Yet, here and there composed,
They fill this heart with a sweet, savory ache.


- William Wordsworth
