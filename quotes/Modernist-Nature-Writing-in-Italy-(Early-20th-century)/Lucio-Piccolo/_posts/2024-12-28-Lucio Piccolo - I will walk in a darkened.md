I will walk in a darkened wood,
where unknown ways escape their own endings;
perhaps Iâ€™ll stop and listen to the leaves,
their whispered conversations,
in an undertone of twilight.
Each tree will be a keeper
of ancient secrets, their roots
held firm against the storms of time.

And I shall find myself there,
in the silence thick as air,
a spirit intertwined with pine, oak,
and perhaps the ghost of some
distant star.

The night will drape itself,
a gentle shroud,
over the world awake with murmurs,
a chorus of the uninvited
that guards the paths of starlight.

- Lucio Piccolo
