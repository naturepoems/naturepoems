Nature speaks in hushed delight,
Where mountains cradle the azure sea,
Each echo carries the day to night,
Inviting all to simply be.

The rustle of leaves sways my heart,
The laughter of streams, a gentle call,
In this vast world, where life imparts,
The magic of nature’s endless thrall.


- Rupert Brooke
