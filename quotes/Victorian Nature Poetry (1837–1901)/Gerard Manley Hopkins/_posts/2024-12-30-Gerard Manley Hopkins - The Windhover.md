In the forest I hear  
Among the whispers of the leaves  
A broken string of hours  
Wild as a woodpecker  
Swaying atop the lip of bark  
Where, though I lack wings,  
I sing a silent hymn;  
  
Only the echoes attend—to climb  
Each sudden burst from the boughs  
Like the sun breaking cloud from heaven,  
Where a voice loosed and set  
  
Through the brows of greenime I beseech,  
And only the echoes give courage to sing free.  
For all is within, leaping on air.  

The most gracious, silent heights  
Wind through with lives, and bask beside  
Each flutter; all is bright  
Though that light may cling to foliage—like  
A hand moved where hearts touch;  
Let fall each bud know the sparks beneath.  

And tenderly keep pace with me,  
In the forest I hear.  
  
For mercy in thy sun  
And moon, richer than all toil of earth.

  
Silent as a feather  
Atop the bushes;  
With granted blush,  
Our songs give thanks to skies!

- Gerard Manley Hopkins
