In the wild embrace of nature’s arms, 
I find solace from the world's harsh edge;
Here, the chirp of crickets hums a harmony, 
The rivers sing, and stars weave my dreams.

Each footprint pressed in tender soil — 
And each breath shaped by the embrace of trees;
Amongst the remnants of ancient whispers, 
I am one with the land, with its pulse.

Yonder mountains remind me of wisdom,
Of issues laid bare in the light of dawn;
In the depth of twilight, as silence falls, 
I am boundless; the wild my heart's home.

- John Muir
