I feel the presence of lofty trees,
Their mighty branches reach the skies.
Whispering winds through the leaves,
Murmuring secrets of distant lands.

Nature speaks in riddles,
Her voice, a breeze in the dark.
In silence, I listen to her tales,
Breathing in her fragrant spells.

The dance of shadows on the ground,
The glow of sunlight in the dawn.
The river sings a gentle song,
And I am but a part of her.


- Juliusz Słowacki
