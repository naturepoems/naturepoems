Doth thou not hear the distant plash,  
As the falls cascade down gemmed rocks,
The sylvan dreams shall softly clash,  
Against the world's unyielding clocks.

With rushes groaning in the night,
The moon utters its tender scorn,
And clues of drops in the waning light,
Come forth like dreams without a form.


- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
