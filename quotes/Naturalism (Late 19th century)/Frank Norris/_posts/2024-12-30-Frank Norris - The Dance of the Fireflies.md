The Dance of the Fireflies  
In the warm summer twilight, the fireflies glimmer,  
As the dusk settles down, and the day grows dimmer;  
With flickers of light that sway to and fro,  
They weave through the trees, a magical show.
 
A ballet unscripted, in patterns they play,  
Illuminating beauty as the night melts away;  
In the embrace of the darkness, they find their delight,  
In the symphony breathed from the stars shining bright.
 
So stand in the stillness, let your heart come alive,  
In the dance of the fireflies, where dreams will thrive;  
For within fleeting moments, the world feels anew,  
And the night holds a magic that beckons to you.

- Frank Norris
