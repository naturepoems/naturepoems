Ode to the orchard, a symphony of sight,
With branches heavy with promise, alive,
A fragrant dance beneath the sun's light,
In this jubilant burst, we thrive.

The softest breeze whispers secrets anew,
As fruit and flower engage in their bliss,
Each blossoming moment is kissed by the dew,
In nature's embrace, we cannot miss.

So gather close to the heart of the land,
In unity with the pulse of the trees,
Hand in hand with what nature has planned,
We find our solace in the world's deep pleas.

- Walt Whitman
