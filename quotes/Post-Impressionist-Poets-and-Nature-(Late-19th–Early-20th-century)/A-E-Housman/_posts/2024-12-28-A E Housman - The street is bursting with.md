The street is bursting with liveliness,
Though the rain will have its say,
At dawn a shimmer of new bright green
Will dance upon the lawn of day.

The dew on every petal shows
The beauty, pure, and so divine;
While clear, bright each encroaching glow,
Softens what is coarse with time.

- A E Housman
