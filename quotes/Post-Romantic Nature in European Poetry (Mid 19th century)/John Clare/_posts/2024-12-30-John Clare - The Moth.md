The Moth

A little moth with wings outspread,
Upon the fragrant flower lay,
And fluttered like a dreams’ sweet bed
Bright in the sunbeam's shining ray.

A simple joy to life unmasked,
It wove through petals, quick and soft;
Intent on all the joys to bask,
Lammering in shadows, sweet aloft.

So let the moth, by grace awake,
Sow love into the twilight's hair;
For Life itself, sweet joys will take—
A gentle dance, a dream, a prayer!

- John Clare
