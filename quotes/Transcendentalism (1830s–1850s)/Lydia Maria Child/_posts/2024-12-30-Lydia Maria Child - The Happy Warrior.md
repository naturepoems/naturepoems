THE HAPPY WARRIOR

Who is the happy warrior? Who is he
That every man in arms should wish to be?
It is the generous spirit, who does no wrong,
But holds his head high, steadfast and strong.

He labours, and he stays, as days go on,
For love of peace, the joys of man have won.
He can not fear, he’ll stand up for the best,
And know in duty’s name he’ll find his rest.

His arms might turn like petals, soft and fair,
His heart is pure, he seeks the good everywhere.
Oh happy warrior! Trust in nature still,
For truth, I tell you, will lead him to the hill.

- Lydia Maria Child
