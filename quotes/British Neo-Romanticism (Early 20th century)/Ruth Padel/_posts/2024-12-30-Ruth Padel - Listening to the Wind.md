Listening to the Wind
I listen to the wind's hushed whispers,  
as it sweeps through the valleys,  
carrying the scent of distant seas,  
or the laughter of the mountains,  
its voice a haunting melody.

Each gust tells a tale,  
of storms past, of sunlit days,  
where it curls around me,  
warming chilled skin,  
a ephemeral connection to the sky.

Oh to dance with the wind,  
as it twirls the branches,  
so effortlessly, a celebration  
of wildness, freedom,  
a reminder of where I belong.

- Ruth Padel
