In the golden hour of dusk,
The world slows to a gentle sigh,
As the sun bows low, a final salute,
Embracing the horizon, saying goodbye.

The colors meld, a painterâ€™s dream,
Filling the sky with hues profound,
Each moment a treasure to cherish, 
A reminder of beauty that knows no bounds.

And as night falls like a velvet cloak,
The stars awaken in a tranquil trance,
In this serene passage of day to night,
Life dances softly, inviting us to dance.

- Umberto Saba
