Amidst the haze of morning dew,
The forest breathes anew,
Soft rays filter through the leaves,
Beneath the canopy of hope,
Where whispers of dawn softly glow.

Every creature stirs with purpose,
In the cradle of the waking world,
Nature's heartbeat is a promise,
Of another day for the living,
In the tapestry of endless life.
