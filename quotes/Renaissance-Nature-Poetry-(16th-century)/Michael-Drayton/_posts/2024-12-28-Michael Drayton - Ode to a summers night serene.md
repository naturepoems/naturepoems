Ode to a summer’s night, serene,  
When every whisper stirs the leaves;  
The fragrance of the flowers, keen,  
In every breath the heart believes;  

The nocturnal symphony unfolds,  
As every star above me glows,  
The beauty of the world beholds,  
And in this moment love bestows.

- Michael Drayton
