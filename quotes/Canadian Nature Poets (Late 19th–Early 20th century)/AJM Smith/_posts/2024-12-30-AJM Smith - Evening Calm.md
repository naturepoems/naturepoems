Evening Calm

As shadows lengthen, day takes leave,
   The horizon blushes in the fading light,
A calm descends, we breathe, believe,
   In the stillness, our spirits take flight.

The stars emerge in twinkling dance,
   Like diamonds set against the sphere,
In evening's hush, we take our chance,
   To find the joy, the love, the clear.

The world becomes a sacred space,
   Where night enfolds us, soft and kind,
In nature's arms, we find our place,
   In evening calm, our hearts unwind.
