author: Marianne Moore
quote: "Summer grass, unworn, 
a life of birds flutters through it, 
a play of light on feathers. 
Most things forgotten, 
bare as blades of wheat, 
yet edible thoughts take root in the ground."

Summer grass, unworn, 
a life of birds flutters through it, 
a play of light on feathers. 
Most things forgotten, 
bare as blades of wheat, 
yet edible thoughts take root in the ground.

- Marianne Moore
