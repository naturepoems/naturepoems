The Grass so little has to do,  
A sphere of simple green -  
Yet hold the Golds of all the world  
And makes the reeds in between -  

With wind and daffodils and dew  
A glory over all -  
Its beauty too, like mine, is the same  
In nature I use a call -  

A quiet leaf is hidden where  
So little there can be -  
Of all that nature's beauty is  
Beneath the mighty tree -  

A smaller world in spheres of air  
And golden hours unfurl -  
The moments found in life are few -  
But sweet is every swirl.

- Emily Dickinson
