The branches of the willow sway  
In secret dance with shadows made —  
Amidst the blue, the distant gray,  
Where silence plays, and shades cascade.  

Here in the hush, a place I find,  
A tranquil heart, a weary mind;  
The river's flow, through grass and glade,  
A hush that fills the evening shade.  

The flowers bend, the grasses sway;  
A gentle breeze unfolds the way —  
To kiss the valley's edge in play,  
While evening's dusk promises stay.  

In Nature's arms I’ll falleth free,  
For all that's known brings peace to me.

Her touch upon me lingers long,  
Inside this very heart — a song.

- William Wordsworth
