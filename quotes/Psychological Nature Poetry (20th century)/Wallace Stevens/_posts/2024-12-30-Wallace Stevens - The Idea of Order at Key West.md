The Idea of Order at Key West

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed of itself alone;
The lady from another graced the sea
And without us could not be:
The choral flame lay indeed beyond the sea,
A melody that was the girl and fire.

And where she stood and sang, at the head of the sea,
We heard the music blowing a dark blaze.
For we learned to distinguish the beauty
That belonged to the living and the fire
From which the stars were kindled.
The sea, a blue field, what it began,
We shall not discover it alone.
We learn and sing this in the plural,
The plural being one more time.

It was there we came to live, abroad in space,
Exactly defined by the symmetry of the cost:
All qualities as shattered as the sea’s
Great occasions had worked their number.
Thus, it was at the head where the light fell,
When it could, half-white, from across the water.
The music grew like summer fruit,
When we began to see and sing; 
The sea from white, burning closer, appeared
To us sounding the one life's firm descent.

The idea of order was the mystical flame,
The fire in the vault of the sea.
Between genius and the sea, none is alone.
He is the head of all these evennesses;
He is our cause—a friend at the edge
Of this emotion that was living summer’s end,
This brilliant foam of moonlight, tide, and death.
