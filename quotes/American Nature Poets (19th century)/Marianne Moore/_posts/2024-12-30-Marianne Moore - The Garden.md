The Garden

The garden goes on beyond the green,
In gold-tinged memories of summer leaves,
Transfixed by the worldâ€™s kaleidoscope layer.
Nature imbues each detail with light,
As fragments of petals unfurl, one by one,
Releasing their scents through soft breezes,
Swaying in the embrace of a gentle wind,
They smile down upon the earth's spring embrace.


- Marianne Moore
