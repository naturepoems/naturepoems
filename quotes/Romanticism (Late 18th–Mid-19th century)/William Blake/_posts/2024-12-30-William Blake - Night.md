Night

The sun is gone, but I have a place  
In the dusky skies and the soft embrace  
Of nighttime. The moon stands tall above.  
Ghostly whispers; a palm leaf love.

Into the night my heart does roam,  
With the shadows, under whispers of the dome  
Where trees dance and stars spin;  
I am alone in this silent din.


- William Blake
