Christabel

'Tis a lovely morn! the sun is bright,  
    And clouds gleam like touches of sweet delight;  
And the birds with gentle songs are free—  
A presence here enfolds the Dunmoor tree.
The white clouds drift on in the azure sky,  
And enhance the charm that ripples by;  
The sudden wind that sweeps the leaves  
Tells a tale where nature grieves.

So come to rest on my gentle hand,  
O pristine touch of Beauty last!  
In tones, full and vibrant, thine joy is glimpsed;  
I’ll weave the lines for the drapes to cast!

- Samuel Taylor Coleridge
