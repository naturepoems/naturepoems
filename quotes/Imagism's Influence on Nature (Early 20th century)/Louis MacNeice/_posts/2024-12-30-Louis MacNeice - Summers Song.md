The bee drifts slowly in yellow blooms,
Murmuring echoes of longing of day,
With the soft cloud's blow, it spells perfume,
And my heart mimics that bee in its play.

In the summer, life runs deep,
Emit a fragrance that fills the shade;
Each moment is one that I keep,
And the music of heart, in the sun, is made.


- Louis MacNeice
