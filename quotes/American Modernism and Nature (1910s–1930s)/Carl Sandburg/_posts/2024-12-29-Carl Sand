Autumn Song
The old brown leaves fall from the branches,
On the green grass they heaped and laid,
Under a stone they turn in the hollow,
Holding the shades of the gray world!

Would you go shining, I remain,
Bringing the cold pressing pines all to bear,
Till the wide white fields are merry,
Laughter like flying colors, hard to hold!

The old brown leaves cling to each other,
In hollows and on walls in impressive shades,
In soft touches, they slide through the sky,
As autumns sing their calls along the way!

Stand high enough on a black-gray stone
to love the moon at breezes!
The winter changes, glimmering far along,
Till I rest and the modern finds a shade,
By sunset calls and whispers of time.
The edges run away, and the backs grow small,
All fall together and breathe together;—
All fall together throw a hymn beneath the skies.

- Carl Sandburg
