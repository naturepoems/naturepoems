Beneath the sky, so vast, so wide,
The river flows, a gentle guide.
Its waters shimmer, bright and bold,
A liquid pathway to tales untold.

The landscapes shift, a painter’s stroke,
In every bend, a story spoke.
Nature’s art, both fierce and kind,
With every ripple, a thought entwined.


- Henry James
