The Earth

There are things the earth
always will recover.
The pine trees,
where the sun bathes
in golden warmth,
will rise again,
when shadows chase the light.

And the waters,
whispering over stones,
will laugh once more,
as they flow back,
carrying memories
of the bright blue sky,
wandering freely among
the valleys of forgotten time.

- Bertolt Brecht
