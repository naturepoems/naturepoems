The Skies
The skies are crying, and I laugh—
That clouds could burst in tears,
And weep upon the grassy path,
That every sound appears.
\nYet from these rain-drops spring the laugh,
And blossoms all the way,
And whether misty joys past laugh—
I feel the life of day.
\nAh, grey brings every laugh anew,
And life is crown'd with praise;
For each must with the daily dew
Awake upon their ways.

- George Meredith
