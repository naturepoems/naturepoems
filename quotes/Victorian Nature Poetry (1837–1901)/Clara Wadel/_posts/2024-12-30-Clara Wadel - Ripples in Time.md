Ripples in Time

In tranquil lakes, the ripples weave,
A tapestry of fleeting dreams,
The water's mirror, shyly leaves,
A glimpse of life, in silken beams.

The willow weeps in gentle waves,
As shadows dance on softest ground,
In nature's arms, the spirit saves,
A quiet solace, love profound.

The sunlight sinks behind the hill,
As night reclines with starry gaze,
In every heartbeat, time stands still,
And nature’s pulse begins to praise.

- Clara Wadel
