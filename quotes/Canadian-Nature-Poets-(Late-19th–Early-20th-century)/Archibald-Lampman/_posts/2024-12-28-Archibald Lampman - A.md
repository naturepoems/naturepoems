A Garden

O green, green world that spreadeth o'er the plain,  
A tapestry of beauty, ever young!  
With flowers that glitter like the gold in rain,  
And birds that trill sweet music on the tongue.

Thy pathways dappled under leafy trees,  
Where shade and sunlight play a sweet duet;  
The gentle sigh of breezes through the leaves,  
Doth hush the heart, and makes me kind and yet.

These blooms, all woven in a tapestry divine,  
Are symbols of the joy that life may bring;  
And in this garden, love and hope entwine,  
With fragrant dreams of every blossoming spring.

- Archibald Lampman
