Autumn whispers, leaves descend,  
A tapestry woven, as seasons blend.  
Crimson hues brush the fading green,  
In the twilight hush, life feels unseen.

A chill in the air, a promise to come,  
The cycle of life, the drum, the drum.  
Every falling leaf, a story unfurls,  
Nature's legacy, as time swirls.

- Sigrid Undset
