Ode to the Clouds
Clouds drift like ships of thought,
a fleet within the sky's vastness;
they voyage on unseen waters,
painting shadows on lands below.

What stories do they tell
as they weave through the air?
Each a thought, each a desire,
whispers of dreams yet unshaped;
a fragmented memory of lovers' trysts
and forgotten elegies.

- Francis Picabia
