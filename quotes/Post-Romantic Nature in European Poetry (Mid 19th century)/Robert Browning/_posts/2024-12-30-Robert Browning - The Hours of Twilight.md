There are moments in the gusts of my breath,  
         When the boiling sun falls with a quiet death,  
         And silence encapsulates the dancing trees—  
         A stillness alive in the shade of these!  
         How soft, how lovingly falls night’s embrace  
         And how the spirit sighs at the tranquil face!

- Robert Browning
