Tears

There was a time when, in the wood,  
My heart was full; the coming flood  
Of leaves all swayed and softly fell,  
Their beauty woven like a spell.

In tears, I see nature dance,  
In joy and sorrow, fleeting chance;  
So let each drop strengthen the soul,  
In the symphonic pulse, the whole.

- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
