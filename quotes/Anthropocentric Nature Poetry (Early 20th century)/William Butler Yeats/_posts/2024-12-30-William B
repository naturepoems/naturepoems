The Ballad of Father Gilligan 

The man was old, and he was all in white,
Of feeble hands and a faded face;
He had no rest till a night imposed,
Where all must wane in heaven’s grace.

Then lean’d he back and became anew,
With barely a branch and a patch of dew,
And found the grace of life refresh,
Where roses coax the climbing hush.

- William Butler Yeats
