The Sunny South

In the sunny, golden South,
Where the herds and waters play,
And the starry sky is mouth,
Whispering again today.

Here the gum and wattle gleam,
Fragrant, rich, and full of grace,
Where the wide expanses beam,
And the stars adorn the space.

May the days of joy return,
With the winds that softly sigh,
And the sun, with hearts that burn,
Underneath the azure sky.

- Henry Lawson
