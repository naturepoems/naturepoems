The Sky

In the azure depths of the summer sky,  
Where the clouds may wander and the larks dance high;  
There in the heavens, my spirit roves free —  
In the canvas of nature, so wondrously.

With each sunrise painting a new day’s song,  
I am one with the world; I feel I belong;  
In the vast expanse, as my heart takes flight,  
May I find my home — in the beauty of light.


- G L D Mackay
