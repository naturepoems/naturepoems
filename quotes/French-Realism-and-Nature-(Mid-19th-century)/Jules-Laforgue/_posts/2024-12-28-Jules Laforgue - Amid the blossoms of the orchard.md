Amid the blossoms of the orchard,  
In the gentle caress of petals,  
I found the heart of spring awakened,  
Colors brimming in the sun's embrace,  
Each bloom a cherished note of life.  
The air brews sweet with honey scents,  
Whispers dance through the lilac air.  
And every moment feels suspended,  
In this cradle of fragrant joys,  
Where life repeats its age-old song,  
And I, a humble spectator, sigh.

- Jules Laforgue
