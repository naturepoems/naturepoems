Let the river run free in its bed,
Turning the stones with gentle sighs;
Whisper low, as the world keeps ahead,
To the song of the dawn that never dies.

Branch by branch, the trees extend,
Reaching for heaven, the sun's warm kiss;
Dancing with joy, they sway and bend,
In the quiet of morning's bliss.

O the river, the trees divine,
In their grace, the world finds peace;
In natureâ€™s arms, may I entwine,
And from all trials, find release.

- Dylan Thomas
