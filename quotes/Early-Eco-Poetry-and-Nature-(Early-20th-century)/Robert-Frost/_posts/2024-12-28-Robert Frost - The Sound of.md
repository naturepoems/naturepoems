The Sound of Trees
I wonder about the trees.
Why do we wish to bear
Forever in the green, so deeply spread?
Toward the horizon wander to draw us away
What climbing brings from the silence, breathing out,
Yet never running far from what we have here,
Trees with skin of bark spread wide over the hills.  
Can we endure this earth and lose no more?

- Robert Frost
