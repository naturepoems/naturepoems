Sweet scents arise from clover clumps,  
And twilight wraps the day in hues,  
Where evening stills the wood’s soft thumps,  
And whispers fill the air like cues.

Let me walk softly through the night,  
Amid the crickets’ serenade,  
In Nature’s arms, all feels so right,  
Where love’s gentle touch shall not fade.

- Bronson Alcott
