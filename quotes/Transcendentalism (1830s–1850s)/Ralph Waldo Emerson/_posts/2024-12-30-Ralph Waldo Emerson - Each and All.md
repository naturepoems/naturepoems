Each and All

I, too, can't change  
The hungry truth of nature's law,
That there exists a universal expressing  
Of one in the whole and the whole  
In one—an inward sound  
By which all beauty is incited;  
Thankful that I am here  
Alive and sustained within.  

The mountain that looms  
Within my sight.  
The gleaming river's course,  
The sky that assuages all seas  
When the sun rests and shadows  
Are rich with distant warmth—  
Holy, holy, this existence  
As I walk in gratitude,  
The whole of Nature covers me.

So beauty speaks through  
The gentlest of the breath  
As the wings of a bird  
That grazes the sky;  
One's heart beats with the living world,  
And there is beauty near to die for.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
