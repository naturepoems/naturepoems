Whispers of the Wind
The wind, a song from distant lands,
Carries secrets of the earth,
Through trees that sway like gentle hands,
In every gust, a new rebirth.

It tells of journeys yet undone,
Of battles fought, of love and loss,
In nature's path, we are but one,
In windswept fields, we find our gloss.

- Aldona Gustava
