To the Rose upon the Rood of Time

O Rose, thou art sick!
The invisible worm
That flies in the night,
In the howling storm,
Has found out thy bed
Of crimson joy:
And his dark secret love
Does thy life destroy.

In the delving of my heart
Where many thoughts abide,
The vision of my heart
Was taken in the light,
Of the garden, where thou dwellest
With tender view,
That my heart may linger
On the silence of the dew.

- William Butler Yeats
