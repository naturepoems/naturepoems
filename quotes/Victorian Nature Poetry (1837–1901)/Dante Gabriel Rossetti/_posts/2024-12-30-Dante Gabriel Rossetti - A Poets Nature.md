A Poet’s Nature
Spring’s pulse is lit in every vein, 
Though shadows linger from the past,  
Beauty holds her sweet refrain,  
In nature’s light, shadows at last.

Here visions blend and ever flow, 
Awake the heart to long for more,  
For in the storm, in the soft glow,  
Is the essence we must adore.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
