The mountains — like a giant’s feet —  
With snow upon their toes —  
That shimmered up into the skies,  
And caught the sunset’s glow —  

And when I wandered in their shade,  
I felt a presence deep —  
As if the earth itself was awake,  
And watching as I weep —  

My thoughts like wildflowers sway  
To every gentle breeze —  
And whisper softly in my ears  
A language few would seize —

- Emily Dickinson
