In the Garden

In the garden where sweet roses grow,
The fragrance dances in the breeze,
A tapestry of life’s soft show,
Amidst the buzzing of the bees.

Colors bloom in radiant song,
As butterflies flit to and fro,
In this haven where I belong,
I lose myself, as wild winds blow.

With every petal, love I find,
In nature's heartbeat, pure and deep,
O garden of my heart and mind,
Where dreams are sown, and joy doth leap.

- Amelia Welby
