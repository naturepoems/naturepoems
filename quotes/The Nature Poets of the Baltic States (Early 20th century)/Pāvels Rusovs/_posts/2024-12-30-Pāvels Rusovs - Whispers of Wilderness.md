From the depths of ancient woods,
Where shadows play and silence reigns,
The whispers of the wind carry,
Stories of time's long passage,
As wilderness cradles its own.

Moss carpets the earth in green,
A cushion for the wandering soul,
And the echoes of the wild,
Lead to the heart's deepest yearning,
For peace in the natural world.
