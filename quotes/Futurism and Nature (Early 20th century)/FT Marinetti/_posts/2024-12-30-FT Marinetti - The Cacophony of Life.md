Amidst the great cacophony of life,
Where birds race against the wind,
And clouds dance furiously,
The spirit liberates the heartbeat of Earth.

Through forests gleaming with fresh hopes,
Where every leaf thrums a quiet hymn,
We find the raw interface,
Of steel grating against soft twilight.

Let us leap into this whirl,
Floating between past and future,
Revel in this electric tapestry,
Woven through clouds and iron roots!

- FT Marinetti
