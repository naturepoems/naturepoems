The Wanderer

The wingeds and the beings known
Spring from ten secrets deeply thrown;
In silence, drift amid shadows they caress,
Where water echoes in a cold caress.
Such welcome thrives, for years still crave;
The ancient path, steeped to pave,
Draws spheres as time, although arcane,
  Works no measure past the rain.

- W H Auden
