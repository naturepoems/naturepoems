Beneath the great oaks, where shadows entwine,
I seek a lost world, both sacred and fine;
With roots that run deep and branches that soar,
In their ancient embrace, I am evermore.

The dance of the leaves in the soft summer air,
Whispers of wisdom, a moment to share;
In the heart of the forest, a truth I have known,
In the beauty of nature, I am never alone.

- David Jones
