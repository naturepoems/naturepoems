The hill is green, and the sky is blue,  
And the song of the bird is sweet and clear;  
The sun is warm, the wind is true,  
And the heart is light when nature is near.  

The valley breathes in the fragrant air,  
And the brook runs bright with a joyous flow;  
In this lovely land, without a care,  
I find my peace where the wildflowers grow.

- Ruth Dallas
