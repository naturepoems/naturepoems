Amidst the wild, the river flows,  
a winding path through stone and glen;  
its murmur tells what nature knows,  
a melody, again and again.
\nLifeâ€™s essence, captured as it sweeps,  
through valleys green and shores of gold;  
it shows us measures, where it leaps,  
tales of the brave and stories bold.

- John Dewey
