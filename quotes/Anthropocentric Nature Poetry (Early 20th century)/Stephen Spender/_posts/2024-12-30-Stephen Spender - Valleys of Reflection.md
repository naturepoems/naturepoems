In the valleys of my thoughts, I wander,
Among shadows, where silence speaks,
Whispers crafted by the currents,
Till the world unveils what nature seeks.

Rivers reveal themselves in hidden folds,
As they carry tales to the vast sea,
And the mountains, like ancient watchmen,
Stand steadfast, guardians of memory.

With every glance towards horizons,
I see the threads intertwine and grow,
And in the heartbeat of this vast landscape,
All that I've lost can find its way home.

- Stephen Spender
