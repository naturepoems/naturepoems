A Summer Night

In a summer nightâ€™s embrace,
The stars are scattered like silver dust,
A whispered harmony amidst the leaves,
While the moon fashions shadows,
Into fleeting forms, more real than human.

The soft sigh of the ocean calls,
With a voice only the night knows,
As gulls wheel high above the waves,
And the salt air is thick with dreams,
Of all that was, and all that is to come.


- George Mackay Brown
