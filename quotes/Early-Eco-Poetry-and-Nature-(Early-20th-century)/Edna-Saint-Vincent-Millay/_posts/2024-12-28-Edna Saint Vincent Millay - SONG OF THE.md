SONG OF THE WOLVES

Oh, sing to me, sweet nightingale,
Underneath this silvered sky,
With constellations we can trace,
In winds that carry soft goodbye.

Letâ€™s roam beneath the pinewood shade,
Where echoes roll the distant tune,
With every breath, this green embrace,
Harbors our love till come the moon.


- Edna Saint Vincent Millay
