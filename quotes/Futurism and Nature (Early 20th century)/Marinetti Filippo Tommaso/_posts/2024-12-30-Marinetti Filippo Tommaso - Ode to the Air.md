Ode to the Air
Odorless, invisible, dread air
Alive with feverish adrenaline

the blade of a lower-cutting angel
riding the frantic waves of the heavens,

whole volumes of the whiteness of snow
prepare us for the steep communion
with the grass of our beating hearts!

Air! Air! Air!
You alight within a gunshot now!  
We shall scorn your martyrdom of ash with joy!  

We shall breathe your space, your freshness,  
we shall fill nostrils with the music of storms!  

Fragile glories of life, slow as death,
A happiness gone wild!  

Oh hell, cheers for the air!
And cheers for our butterfly ambitions!

- Marinetti Filippo Tommaso
