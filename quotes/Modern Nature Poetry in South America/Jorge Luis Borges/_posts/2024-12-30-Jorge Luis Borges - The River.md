The River

A river slices through,
Its body of wandering whispers,
Tracing tales of love and loss,
Embracing the rhythm of the earth.

Water flows like memory,
Carving the land’s face,
Beneath the stone and soil,
Intertwining dreams and time.

To walk alongside is to listen,
To learn the wisdom of the ages,
Where nature’s heartbeat
Resounds in every ripple.


- Jorge Luis Borges
