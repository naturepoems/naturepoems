The Desert's Heart

Where the sand stretches, golden and vast,
The sun reigns supreme, a relentless king.
In the stillness, the echoes of the past,
In the heart of dryness, a new life can spring.

Cacti rise like sentinels in the haze,
Holding secrets under their prickly guise.
In their silence, the desert displays,
A beauty that lingers, a truth that defies.

Oh, wilderness fierce, in your harshest embrace,
I find a spirit, raw, unyielding, true.
For in the hot breath of your empty space,
I glimpse the infinite, the wonder anew.

- Pablo Neruda
