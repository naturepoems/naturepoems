The clouds drift slowly on the sky,
As shadows flit on fields of green,
With golden rays and whispers high,
God's presence felt in every scene.

The earth, adorned in Nature's glee,
Reflects his spirit, pure and free;
I wander deep, far from the strife,
To join the song, the dance of life.

- Joyce Kilmer
