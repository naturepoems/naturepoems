Wildflowers

Among the fields of endless green,
Where sunlight spills its golden sheen,
The wildflowers, in freedom, sway,
A riot of color, bright and gay.

With petals soft as dreams they weave,
A tapestry for all who believe,
In nature’s grace, a lovely hymn,
With every bloom, the shadows dim.

Oh wildflowers, with spirits free,
You dance beneath the willow tree,
And every breeze that brushes by,
Will carry forth your sweet reply.

So let me roam this fragrant land,
With wildflowers, hand in hand,
For in their beauty lies the truth,
Of joy reclaimed, and love, and youth.

- Marjorie Pickthall
