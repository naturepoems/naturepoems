Invitation to the Dance
Dance, the tree,
The green tree, the dancing tree,
You will not be, because you are,
Right of the wind, the rapture of colors.

Dance, the flower,
The flower that watches,
You will not see the flame,
The flame of the ancients.

Dance, the sky,
The blue sky, the dancing sky,
You sing, the song,
The song of all moments,

Etched in the heart of the earth,
In the rhythm of the worlds.


- Léopold Sédar Senghor
