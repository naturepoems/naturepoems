The Journey

One day you finally knew  
what you had to do, and began,  
though the voices around you  
kept shouting  
their bad advice—  
though the whole house  
began to tremble  
and you felt the old tug  
at your ankles.  
“Mend my life!”  
you said.  
There is nothing  
you can do.  
But you have to go.  
And you have to go  
into the dark, alone.  
Into the wide, moving world  
you went—  
you took your first step,  
and you didn’t look back.

- Mary Oliver
