Gathering of the clouds, high as a tower,
Pattering of the raindrops falls,
Bathe me in thy silver shower,
As from me you collect your calls.

In full harmony they sing,
A song of earth and sky combined,
Reminding me what joy may bring,
That nature’s grace is truly kind.

   — "The Rainbow" (Excerpt)

- John Keats
