The River  
   by Louis MacNeice

The river winds like a thought,  
Tumbles and twists in a dance,  
Glinting leaves in the sunlit water,  
Straying under the boughs that glanceâ€”  
While shadows form on meandering banks,  
And dusk draws the tension of light,  
With sighs of nature  
Graced in all its might.

- Louis MacNeice
