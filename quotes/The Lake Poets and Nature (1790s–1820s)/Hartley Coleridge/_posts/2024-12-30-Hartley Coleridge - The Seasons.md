The Seasons

Winter's frost and summer's heat,  
In nature's breadth the seasons meet;  
With autumn's gold and springtime's bloom,  
Each cycle brings its sweet perfume.

Awake, awake, my spirit sings!  
In harmony, each season brings;  
From thawing snow to blossomed trees,  
In every phase, my heart finds ease.

- Hartley Coleridge
