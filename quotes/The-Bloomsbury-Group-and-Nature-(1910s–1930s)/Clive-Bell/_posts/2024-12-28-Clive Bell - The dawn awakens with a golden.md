The dawn awakens with a golden glow,
As mist and dew paint the earth below.
Birds chirp softly, their morning cries,
Nature's chorus under the skies.

Trees stretch tall, their branches wide,
Harboring secrets they cannot hide.
The buzzing of bees, the flutter of wings,
Remind us of all the joy nature brings.

- Clive Bell
