That leads still"

author: William Butler Yeats
quote: "The wand of the sage
That leads still back to the fount,
Through the caves of the earth,
Through the valleys and peaks,
Leads still back to the light
That all lesser lights haunt.
Yet how far can I leap,
When light is not there
To see my feet and tremble,
To see my breast again, back,
When I continue my climb,
However far may it go
Into the dark of the earth,
Or into the light below."

The wand of the sage
That leads still back to the fount,
Through the caves of the earth,
Through the valleys and peaks,
Leads still back to the light
That all lesser lights haunt.
Yet how far can I leap,
When light is not there
To see my feet and tremble,
To see my breast again, back,
When I continue my climb,
However far may it go
Into the dark of the earth,
Or into the light below.

- William Butler Yeats
