I saw the petal fall and the leaf let go,
Frost somewhere lingers, and tangles back again.
Outside, the flower-girls roam the street;
Subtle, through winter's embrace, try to find holes,
Different faces are caught in the light.
Morning unravels in the rising hour,
For the leaves renew; towards heaven they twine.
