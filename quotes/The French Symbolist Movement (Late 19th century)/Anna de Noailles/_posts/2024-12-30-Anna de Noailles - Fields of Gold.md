Through fields of gold, the wind carries sighs,
Whispers of longing woven in the grass;
Nature hums a lullaby, sweet and low,
Touching every heart that dares to listen.

The horizon blushes as the sun dips down,
A canvas of colors, an artist's dream;
In that fleeting moment, magic unfolds,
Seduction of dusk in a world made sacred.

- Anna de Noailles
