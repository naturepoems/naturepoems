Hauraki Gulf

A jewel of water, the Hauraki sings,  
Where the wind plays soft on the seabird's wings,  
Islands dot the horizon, a painter's dream,  
In the embrace of the ocean, we toil and scheme.

With waves that whisper secrets of old,  
And tales of journeys that must be told,  
This sanctuary cradles life in its flow,  
In the tranquil tides where our spirits go.

May the currents be gentle, the skies always clear,  
For the Hauraki Gulf, we hold so dear,  
A testament of beauty, grace, and love,  
A reflection of heaven, below and above.

- P E J M Taylor
