The forest stands in patient might,
A sentinel of ancient lore,
Its branches sway, in silver light,
As whispers drift upon the floor.

The twilight cloak, in dusky hues,
Bears witness to the fading day,
And in this peace, our hearts renew,
As night enfolds the sunâ€™s soft play.

- Charles Baudelaire
