quote: "Mountain peaks, cloaked in mist, a dream I chase,
In their silent grandeur, I find a sacred space.
The air, sharp with whispers of history and grace,
Nature's pure embrace, a calm I long to trace."

Mountain peaks, cloaked in mist, a dream I chase,
In their silent grandeur, I find a sacred space.
The air, sharp with whispers of history and grace,
Nature's pure embrace, a calm I long to trace.

- Gaston Bachelard
