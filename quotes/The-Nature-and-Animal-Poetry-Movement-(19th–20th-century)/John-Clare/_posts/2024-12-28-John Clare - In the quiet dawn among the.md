In the quiet dawn, among the dew,
The world awakens, fresh and new.
Behold, the blossom, shyly unfolds,
A tale of life that nature holds.

The chirp of crickets, the rustle of leaves,
A language of Earth that softly weaves.
Through thickets and thorns, the wild things roam,
In every thistle, nature finds home.

From nest to brook, from sky to ground,
The symphony of life can be found.
Let me wander where the wildflowers sway,
In the heart of the woods, my spirit shall play.
— John Clare
