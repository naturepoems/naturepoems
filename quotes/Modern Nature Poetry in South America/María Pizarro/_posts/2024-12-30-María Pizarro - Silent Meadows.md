Silent Meadows

In whispers among the grass,
a soft rustle that holds my fears,
a symphony played for the lonely,
a song of heart and home.

Here, the horizon bows to dreams,
a canvas of hope painted wide,
as the sun serenades the earth,
with notes only nature knows.

I lay among the blossoms,
alive in this gentle embrace,
as the world drifts and sways,
a moment carved in quietude.


- María Pizarro
