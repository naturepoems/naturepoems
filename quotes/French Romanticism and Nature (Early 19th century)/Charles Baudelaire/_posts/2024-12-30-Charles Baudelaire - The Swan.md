The Swan

A swan glides through the lake’s reflective grace,  
In silence, unspeaking—a chaste embrace;  
The world distorts in its solemn draw,  
As ripples spin this world into awe.

Luxurious plumage floats on the air,  
A metaphor wrapped in a woman’s despair;  
Each stroke of the water a memory scorned,  
A tragic beauty in nature’s mourned.

Oh! elegy of the life we wish to be,  
In the shimmering depths, dark dreams run free;  
So let us trace the path of the swan,  
Through this life of strife, till the last light dawn.

- Charles Baudelaire
