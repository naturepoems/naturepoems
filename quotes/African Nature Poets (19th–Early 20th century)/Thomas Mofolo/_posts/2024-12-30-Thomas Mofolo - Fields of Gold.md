In the fields of gold, where the sunflowers sway,  
I find a refuge from the fray,  
The rustle of grass, the hum of bees,  
A harmony born from the gentle breeze.

With every bloom, a promise made,  
Of renewal, of hope, of life's parade,  
Through seasons changing, we find our place,  
In the dance of existence, we find grace.

- Thomas Mofolo
