The Bloom of Spring
In springâ€™s embrace, the blossoms wake,
Colors burst, and life appears,
Each petal, a promise we make,
With laughter, love, and joyful tears.

Birds new song fills the vibrant air,
A melody of hope reborn,
Nature's tapestry beyond compare,
In every breath, the heart is sworn.

- Aasta Holth
