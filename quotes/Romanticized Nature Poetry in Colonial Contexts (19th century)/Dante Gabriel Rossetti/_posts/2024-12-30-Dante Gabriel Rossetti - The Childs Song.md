The Child's Song

I
  Lullaby soft, the child hums low,
     In dreams beneath the trees aglow,
     Each petal speaks of loveâ€™s embrace,
     In tinkling light, the moon's haste.

II
  The stars shine bright, a sylvan sight,
     While golden whispers fill the night,
     A child's song, in nature's heart,
     A world renewed, as dreams depart.

- Dante Gabriel Rossetti
