When the twilight falls, and the shadows creep,  
And the world turns soft in the evening glow;  
I wander out where the willows weep,  
And the river winds like a thread of slow.  

The stars awake in the dusky sky,  
And the moon spills silver on the sleeping lake;  
I pause and listen, as night drifts by,  
And the heart finds rest, as the world must take.

- Ruth Dallas
