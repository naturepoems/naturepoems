ECHOES

In the quiet woods where whispers meet,
Footsteps linger as if to tease the air, 
The echoes murmur softly, bittersweet, 
A dance of moments that we cannot share. 

Each tree a witness to our secret flight, 
A tapestry of stories etched in bark, 
While time stands still, casting shadows of light,
In nature's arms we find a gentle spark.
