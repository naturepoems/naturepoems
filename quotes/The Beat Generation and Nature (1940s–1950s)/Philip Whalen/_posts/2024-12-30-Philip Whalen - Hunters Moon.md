Hunter’s Moon

The moon hangs heavy
in the deep cold air,
eyes of the night smolder,
anoints the dark ground.

Animal shadows shift,
tender whispers of instinct,
treading a path of silver,
woven in moonlight.

This night dances,
a hunter’s patience waits,
a glimpse of the twilight,
before morning awakes.

Philip Whalen
