---

As dawn breaks, a tapestry spun,
With colors that kiss the waking day,
A promise held when night is done,
In the light of hope, shadows sway.

Birds chirp a song of a new refrain,
The world awakens in gentle grace,
In every moment, joy remains,
In nature's rhythm, we find our place.

- Richard Wagner
