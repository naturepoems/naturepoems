The Old Man's Last Run

  The restless rivers flow and flow,
  They cannot pause, nor ever stay;
  Time watches onward with a glow,
  Forever flowing, night and day.

  Old man of nature, gazing forth,
  Upon your prime of youth's delight;
  Beneath the trees of golden worth,
  You watch the day descend to night.


- John Greenleaf Whittier
