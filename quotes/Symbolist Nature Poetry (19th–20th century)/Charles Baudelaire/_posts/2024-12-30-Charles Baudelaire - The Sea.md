The Sea

The sea, the mighty and ever full lake,
Where poetry, love, and madness combine,
Breathes in ebbs and flows at the moon's wake,
Shrouding us in gentle, salt-laden brine.

Dewdrops fraying with every wave's crest,
And the wind sings from its god-like throne,
A lonesome cry of an unfulfilled quest,
Underneath the stars, apart, alone.

Oh! the sea, you tale of despair and grace,
In the thunder, quicksilver leaves the shrouds,
While mist tickles the cliffs, a tender trace,
Time laps, creates shadows among the clouds.

My heart yearns for your depths where mortals drown,
In every grain of sand, lies silence of town creation.

- Charles Baudelaire
