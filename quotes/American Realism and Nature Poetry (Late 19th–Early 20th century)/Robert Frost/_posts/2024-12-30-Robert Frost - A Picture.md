A picture is like a split-rail fence  
Or sky with heft as breaking road  
Or any way in words can be taken hence  
Ten minutes; it all splits where time will go.  

And I shall keep the sun upon my arm  
Of love that was not kept for long  
Until I came again across the farm  
Where gravity gives only to the song.  

So call the reader in: the wood was near  
Where they will take you there with all the trees  
And everyone would finally be whose we are  
And laid one-on-one by every wish with ease.  

Yet every glance returns from where it came  
And soon not back to bring it into sight.  
It’s scattered sun that catches more than flame,  
But stirs me on like paper meant to write.

- Robert Frost
