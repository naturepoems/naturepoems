Under the Shade of the Trees

Under the shade of the trees,
    Where the crimson rose-bloom glows,
And the perfume of golden lilies
    Soft through the sultry stillness flows;
A fairy world, in its silent grace,
    A realm where the heart must cease,
And the spirit of nature's harmony
    Wakes in the soul a peace.


- Alfred Domett
