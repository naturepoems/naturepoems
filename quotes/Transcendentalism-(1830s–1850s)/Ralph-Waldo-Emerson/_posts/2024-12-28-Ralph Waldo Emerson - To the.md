To the Pine-tree

   O solemn tree, thou standest high and tall,
   With limbs outstretched in ardent grace,
   While all around, beneath thy shadows, fall,
   The weary ones, for certain calm solace.

   I watch thy whispering needles, finely drawn—
   Each year, I see you rise, planting wisdom in every dawn.

                                                 —Ralph Waldo Emerson
