With twilight’s brush, the world transforms,
In dusk’s embrace, a stillness warms;
The chirping of the crickets sound,
A lullaby, soft and profound.

As the stars awaken one by one,
In the twilight, we find our fun;
Through nature's peace, our spirits soar,
Where dreams reside, forever more.

- Vladimir Solovyov
