The American Swallow

1. They were all ready to go,
a slow blue sluice desperate
and mean, like winds,
deliberate on simple designs,
like simple thinking.

2. The swallow is in the open,
a creature of the image,
with wings made of unnumbered
embryological instincts.

3. It grocery sails with each flinch
of tail and wing, stirs
the solicitation when away,
one thing seeks another.


- Marianne Moore
