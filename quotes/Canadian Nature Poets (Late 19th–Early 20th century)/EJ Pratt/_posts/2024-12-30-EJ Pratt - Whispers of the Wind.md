Whispers of the Wind  
  
  
The whispers of the wind we hear,  
In forests deep or fields so wide;  
The voice of nature calls us near,  
With echoes of the world's great tide.  
  
It sways the trees, it lifts the leaves,  
In gentle play, it comes alive;  
With every breath, our spirit weaves  
A bond with all that is alive.  
  
So let us listen to that song,  
That chorus of the earth's delight,  
For in each breeze where we belong,  
In nature's heart, we find our light.
