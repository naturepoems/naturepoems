The Garden

The garden lies in summer bloom,  
   With colors rich and bright;  
Amidst the roses, sweetly sigh,  
   With joy that greets the night.  
The petals dance upon the breeze,  
   In fragrant notes of cheer;  
While songbirds sing their love of life,  
   In melodies so clear.  

â€“ Laurence Binyon
