The Pool

Are you alive?  
The water bringer, 

brings water.

Are you alive? 
The bringer brings water.

Bring me to the water.

Bring me to the pool.

Bright and limpid, 

the water gives image 

of the wearers fault.

I am peaceful, and grand;  

I am marble clear; 

I am luminous.  

I lie in the sun.  

The sharp image stares upward, 

and the motion of shadow goes.

I am white, and twined 

by the blue-gray and green,

observant of the color

of the heavens...

are you alive?

Do you see the clouds?

The azure above;  

is it night?  

The stars are visible;  

and I am waiting.

Write me of your fate;  

I am bright and high 

as Aesir is light.

I am a star,  

but my fingers stretch

into the poolâ€”that is,

that is the response.

The response shows me.
