The land speaks to me, 
The flower blooms in silence, 
The air carries whispers.

In the midst of noise: 
The chime of a distant bell, 
Now comes the night, 
Where shadows softly weave.

Time lingers on the hills, 
The sun kisses the sea, 
And the stars twinkle like stories, 
Eternally told.


- Vincenzo Cardarelli
