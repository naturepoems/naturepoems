---

A moment meets me,—
With bright blossoms caught on the breeze,
Let touch bring gently within my hands.
Let the flowerfold soft and tremble, 
That we may linger low,
With earth gangled around
Like whispered leaves; 
Can I feel the warmth, 
Stream across away from me,
From the river passing wide along the fields.

And the willow bends low to whisper
Wherestands the stone and moss beneath,
Let sighs become layer and pattern,
In the mist of those dreams.
Come and share this heart’s own vision,
Under the breath of silence, lush and free.
