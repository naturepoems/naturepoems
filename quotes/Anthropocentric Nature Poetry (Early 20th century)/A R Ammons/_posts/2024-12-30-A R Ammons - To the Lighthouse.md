To the Lighthouse

The lighthouse stands solid,
  its shadow a promise,
  a light against darkness,
  a guide among the waves.
And I, only a wave,
  crash against the rocks,
only a voice,
  vanish in the storm.
The light holds fast,
  one can only steer by it,
by it, by it â€”
  and yet I wander,
always wandering away,
  seeking my pattern,
  a shift within this sheet of sea.

- A R Ammons
