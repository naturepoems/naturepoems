Upon the hill, where daisies sway,
In lazy warmth of golden day,
I find the solace of the green,
Where nature’s breath and heart convene.
The sun-drenched fields embrace the wild,
And in their hold, I feel like a child—
With every scent and sound arrayed,
My spirit lifts, unbound, unfrayed.

In wild abundance, life unfolds,
Through stories whispered, tale retold,
The rustle in the trees above,
Weaves threads of time, in bonds of love.
O sweetest earth, with arms so wide,
Within you, every joy doth bide,
For in your heart, I know my place,
In Nature’s weave, I find my grace.

- Dora Carrington
