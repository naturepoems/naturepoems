There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
There is society, where none intrudes,
By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:
I love not Man the less, but Nature more,

From these our interviews, we rise uprooted,
From the low Vistas of this valley, alone,
To the high current woods, and thence befooted,
With a wilderness of dreams, and thou upon

This detached rocky isle is where abide
Our stolen moments and our hopes do ride,
Through daylight and through dream, come let us bide.  

The world may change us, love but is our guide.

Where it leads idly with its charms,
From chilling nights to freefalling days.
We owe it peace, where human life disarms,
And yet, abide we shall in Nature's gaze.

- William Wordsworth
