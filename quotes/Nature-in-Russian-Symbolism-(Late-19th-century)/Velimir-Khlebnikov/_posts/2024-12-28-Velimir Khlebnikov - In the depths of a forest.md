In the depths of a forest,  
a world of green unfolds,  
every leaf a miracle,  
every branch a bridge  
to the heavens above,  
where birds bear messages  
of peace and unity.  

The quiet rustle of the underbrush,  
a symphony conducted by the wind,  
every creature playing its part,  
a testament to the harmony  
of nature's grand design.

- Velimir Khlebnikov
